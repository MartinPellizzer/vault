The crop quality drops daily due to their exposure to biotic and abiotic stresses, especially pathogens. It needs to be improved to maintain the consumption level to cope with increasing population demands for food. The current study was designed to analyze the comparison of the effects of green synthesis approaches on pathogens associated with rice seeds. In this study, essential oils were extracted from <i>Cymbopogon citratus</i>, <i>Thymus vulgaris</i>, and <i>Origanum vulgaris</i> medicinal plants and used as fungicides on fungal strains of <i>Aspergillus</i> spp. <i>T. vulgaris</i> effectively controlled the growth of <i>Aspergillus niger</i>, <i>Aspergillus flavus</i>, and <i>Aspergillus terreus</i> as compared with <i>O. vulgaris</i> and <i>Cymbopogon</i>. Further, silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) were synthesized from rice husk to evaluate their antifungal activities. SiNPs were characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy with a broad peak at 281.62\u2009nm. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy spectrum confirms the presence of Si-H, Si-OH, and Si-O-Si bonds functional groups, and SiO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedral coordination unit. X-ray diffraction pattern describes the crystalline structure with a sharp peak at 2\u03b8\u2009=\u200922\u00b0. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy confirmed the spherical shape, size 70-115\u2009nm, and elemental composition with pure silica contents. SiNPs showed no significant antifungal activity against <i>Aspergillus</i> strains. Moreover, <i>Trichoderma</i> was isolated from the rhizosphere of rice fields and showed a surprising antifungal effect against <i>A. terreus</i>, <i>A. niger</i>, and <i>A. flavus.</i> The current study successfully revealed environment-friendly and cost-effective green synthesizing approaches for analyzing biocontrol potential against rice seed-related <i>Aspergillus</i> spp. They will also help to improve pathogen control strategies in other cereals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0748-9745"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences (Female Campus), Faculty of Basic and Applied Sciences, International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Kiani", "ForeName": "Bushra Hafeez", "Initials": "BH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences (Female Campus), Faculty of Basic and Applied Sciences, International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sagheer", "ForeName": "Aneeqa", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioresource Conservation Institute, Plant Genetic Resource Institute, National Agricultural Research Centre, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Erum", "ForeName": "Shazia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infectious Diseases, College of Veterinary Medicine, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA."}], "LastName": "Haque", "ForeName": "Muhammad Izhar Ul", "Initials": "MIU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Microbiology, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Okla", "ForeName": "Mohammad K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."}], "LastName": "Kataya", "ForeName": "Amr R A", "Initials": "ARA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Sciences and Nutrition, College of Food and Agricultural Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Al-Qahtani", "ForeName": "Wahidah H", "Initials": "WH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Microbiology, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Abdel-Maksoud", "ForeName": "Mostafa A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Foodborne Pathog Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "101120121", "ISSNLinking": "1535-3141"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus flavus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37917090", "10.1089/fpd.2023.0083"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
