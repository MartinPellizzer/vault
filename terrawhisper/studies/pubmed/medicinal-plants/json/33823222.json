One of the main features of hard organs and tissues is the mineralization of their extracellular matrices (ECM) to enable them to withstand pressure and weight. Recently, a variety of printing strategies have been developed to facilitate hard organ and tissue regeneration. Fundamentals in three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques are rapid prototyping, additive manufacturing, and layered built-up and solid-free construction. This strategy promises to replicate the multifaceted architecture of natural tissues. Nowadays, 3D bioprinting techniques have proved their potential applications in tissue engineering to construct transplantable hard organs/tissues including bone and cartilage. Though, 3D bioprinting methods still have some uncertainties to fabricate 3D hard organs/tissues. In the present review, most advanced technical improvements, experiments, and future outlooks of hard tissue engineering are discussed, as well as their relevant additive manufacturing techniques."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
