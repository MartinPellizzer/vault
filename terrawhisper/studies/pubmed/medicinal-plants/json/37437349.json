Aberration in FGF19/FGFR4 signaling is oncogenic driving force in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). FGFR4 gatekeeper mutations induced acquired resistance remains an unmet clinical challenge for HCC treatment. In this study, a series of 1H-indazole derivatives were designed and synthesized as new irreversible inhibitors of wild-type and gatekeeper mutant FGFR4. These new derivatives showed significant FGFR4 inhibitory and antitumor activities, among which compound 27i was demonstrated to be the most potent compound (FGFR4 IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a02.4\u00a0nM). Remarkably, compound 27i exhibited no activity against a panel of 381 kinases at 1\u00a0\u03bcM. Additionally, compound 27i displayed nanomolar IC<sub>50</sub>s against huh7 (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a021\u00a0nM) and two mutant cell lines, BaF3/ETV6-FGFR4-V550L and BaF3/ETV6-FGFR4-N535K (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a02.5/171\u00a0nM). Meanwhile, compound 27i exhibited potent antitumor potency (TGI: 83.0%, 40\u00a0mg/kg, BID) in Huh7 xenograft mouse models with no obvious toxicity observed. Overall, compound 27i was identified as a promising preclinical candidate for overcoming FGFR4 gatekeeper mutations for HCC treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
