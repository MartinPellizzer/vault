Rectal temperature (Trec) of the rats was continuously monitored during the exposure and the recovery periods. The time for fall of Trec to 23 degrees C and its recovery to 37 degrees C were used as indices of endurance and the adaptogenic activity. Carbohydrate and lipid parameters were investigated to find out the nature of fuel being used during thermogenesis.", "After 12 weeks of administration of an oral dose of 7.5 mg/kg(-1)/day(-1), CIHP-I was found to possess significant adaptogenic activity. CIHP-I helped improve resistance to C-H-R induced hypothermia (Trec 23 degrees C) in animals by increased mobilization of free fatty acids (FFA) from adipose tissue. Blood glucose and muscle glycogen levels were maintained. CIHP-I treatment restricted the release of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) into the circulation during C-H-R exposure.", "The results suggested that CIHP-I is a strong adaptogen. It improved cold resistance during C-H-R exposure and enhanced recovery from hypothermia. The energy-dependent cell membrane permeability was maintained. Stored lipids were mobilised and possibly used for thermogenesis in preference to carbohydrates."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences, Timarpur, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grover", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shyam", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Divekar", "ForeName": "H M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Srivastava", "ForeName": "K K", "Initials": "KK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Altern Complement Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9508124", "ISSNLinking": "1075-5535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8052-42-4", "NameOfSubstance": "asphalt"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Adipose Tissue"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Temperature Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypothermia"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoxia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10381248", "10.1089/acm.1999.5.245"]}}]}
