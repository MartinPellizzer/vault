Three-year-old plants of P. quinquefolium were used in this study, and eight magnesium supply gradients(CK, Mg1-Mg7) were designed for indoor pot experiment(cultivation in soil). The plant growth indexes, nutrient element content in soil and plant, and root saponin content were determined at the end of the growth period. The correlation analysis of nutrient element content in aboveground and underground parts of P. quinquefolium showed significantly negative correlations of magnesium-calcium, magnesium-potassium, and magne-sium-manganese. With the increase in magnesium supply level, the biological absorption coefficient of magnesium increased, while that of total nitrogen, potassium, iron, and manganese decreased; the biological transfer coefficient of magnesium decreased, while that of nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, iron, and manganese increased. The saponin content was analyzed by principal component analysis, which showed the comprehensive score in the order of Mg4(2.537), Mg2(1.001), Mg3(0.600), Mg1(0), Mg7(-0.765), CK(-0.825), Mg6(-0.922), and Mg5(-1.663). The partial least squares-path modeling(PLS-PM) showed that the correlation coefficients of exchangeable magnesium and pH with quality were-0.748 and-0.755, respectively, which were significant. Magnesium-calcium, magnesium-potassium, and magnesium-manganese showed antagonism in the nutritional physiology of P. quinquefolium. Excessive application of magnesium can lead to the imbalance of nutrient elements in P. quinquefolium. The content of exchangeable magnesium in soil suitable for the quality formation of P. quinquefolium was 193.34-293.34 mg\u00b7kg~(-1). In addition to exchangeable magnesium, pH was also important to the quality formation of P. quinquefolium. Therefore, exchangeable magnesium and pH could be regarded as monitoring factors for the quality formation of P. quinquefolium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Animal and Plant Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Changchun 130112, China Jilin Provincial Key Laboratory of Cultivation and Propagation of Chinese Medicinal Materials Changchun 130112, China."}], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Jia-Qi", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Animal and Plant Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Changchun 130112, China Jilin Provincial Key Laboratory of Cultivation and Propagation of Chinese Medicinal Materials Changchun 130112, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Hai", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Animal and Plant Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Changchun 130112, China Jilin Provincial Key Laboratory of Cultivation and Propagation of Chinese Medicinal Materials Changchun 130112, China."}], "LastName": "Ruan", "ForeName": "Yin-Yin", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Animal and Plant Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Changchun 130112, China Jilin Provincial Key Laboratory of Cultivation and Propagation of Chinese Medicinal Materials Changchun 130112, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Hu-Ping", "Initials": "HP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Animal and Plant Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Changchun 130112, China College of Food and Biological Engineering, Chengdu University Chengdu 610106, China Jilin Provincial Key Laboratory of Cultivation and Propagation of Chinese Medicinal Materials Changchun 130112, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ya-Yu", "Initials": "YY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YLU75U4W", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphorus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I38ZP9992A", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutrients"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "34"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35343146", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20211222.102"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
