In ovariectomized mice, the duration of sodium pentobarbital-induced sleep before exposure to stress did not differ markedly from that in the sham-operation group. After exposure to stress, however, the duration of sodium pentobarbital-induced sleep in ovariectomized mice was shortened significantly, compared to the ovariectomized mice without stress. When the effect of Toki-shakuyaku-san on the stress-induced shortening of sleep time was studied, it was found that the shortening of the sleep time was suppressed by treatment with Toki-shakuyaku-san. In ovariectomized mice, the increase in hypothalamic noradrenaline (NA) turnover in response to stress was significantly greater than that in mice with intact ovaries. The stress-induced enhancement of NA turnover was suppressed significantly by Toki-shakuyaku-san in a dose-dependent manner, beginning with a low dose level. When effect of 17Beta-estradiol on the stress induced-shortening of sleep time was examined in ovariectomized mice, by high doses of 17Beta-estradiol the shortening of the sleep time was prolonged. A major difference between 17Beta-estradiol and Toki-shakuyaku-san was the marked uterine weight gain observed following 17Beta-estradiol treatment despite no effect of Toki-shakuyaku-san on uterine weight. The results in this study suggest that Toki-shakuyaku-san may reduce menopausal symptoms by a mechanism different from that of estrogen."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Research Laboratories, Tsumura & Co., Ibaraki, Japan."}], "LastName": "Iizuka", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ishige", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Komatsu", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsumiya", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Inazu", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Takeda", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Spain", "MedlineTA": "Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7909595", "ISSNLinking": "0379-0355"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "toki-shakuyaku-san"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I4744080IR", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentobarbital"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X4W3ENH1CV", "NameOfSubstance": "Norepinephrine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electroshock"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hypothalamus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Norepinephrine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ovariectomy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pentobarbital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9575481", "10.1358/mf.1998.20.1.485630", "485630"]}}]}
