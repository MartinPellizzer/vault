Xanthones constitute an important class of phytochemicals exhibiting a myriad of bioactivities and potential for interacting with multimolecular targets, and xanthones are considered to be privileged phytochemical scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. Recent advances in xanthones biosynthetic pathways are outlined and their metabolic engineering. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art processes for the biotechnological production of xanthones, its limitations, and potential improvements. The <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> tissue culturing methods employed for the production of xanthones from different species of plant are reviewed addressing differences in xanthone classes. This review sheds the light of computational approaches, <i>viz.</i>, response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural networks (ANN), for optimizing the culture performance and improving xanthones production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy Department, College of Pharmacy, Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport, Alexandria, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Khattab", "ForeName": "Amira R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy Department, College of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, School of Sciences and Engineering, The American University in Cairo, New Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Farag", "ForeName": "Mohamed A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8505177", "ISSNLinking": "0738-8551"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9749WEV0CA", "NameOfSubstance": "xanthone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biosynthetic Pathways"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthones"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32054338", "10.1080/07388551.2020.1721426"]}}]}
