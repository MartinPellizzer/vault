Comprehensive spectroscopic analysis (including 1D and 2D NMR, and HRESIMS) and quantum chemistry computations (including ECD and NMR calculations) were applied to elucidate their structures. Weak immunosuppressive activities were observed for the new isolates via inhibiting T cell proliferation and cytokine IFN-\u03b3 secretion in vitro."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
