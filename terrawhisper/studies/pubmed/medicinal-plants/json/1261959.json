Clinical parameters were subjective complaints, such as pain and heartburn, which after a relatively short time, many patients declared to have diminished or ceased completely. Objective parameters were endoscopic explorations before beginning of the treatment, i.e. gastroscopy and biopsy, examinations by gastro-camera and in some cases chromography to exclude a possible malignancy. The control examinations were performed almost exclusively by gastro-camera, and that after 2 and 4 weeks. The ulcer healing stage could be clearly defined after Ohmori and Miwa (1971), its localisation and size were also recorded. Altogether it can be said, that the preparation Caved-S, by a working-principle not as yet exactly defined in all details, effects rapid healing endoscopically provable, but that ulcers with a special localisation, e.g. in the angulus-area of the posterior wall, require a longer healing time according to expectation. Clinically relevant side effects were not observed. Thus it can be concluded that Caved-S is very suitable for the treatment of ventricular ulcers. The preparation has a spasmolytical component leading quickly to freedom from pain, and a protective component effecting a healing tendency which can be demonstrated by endoscopic methods. It must be said, however, that this protective healing-promoter factor has not yet been defined pharmacologically."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mittelstaedt", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schwick", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Zur Therapie des Ulcus ventriculi mit Caved-Si.
