Two varieties of faba seeds were used, locally grown faba bean 'Kalimattar' or 'black' (KSM) (492 g/kg diet) and its exotic counterpart Vicia faba L. minor 'White' (VFW) obtained from International Centre for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) (540 g/kg diet). The pulverized cotyledons of 'Kalimattar' (KMC; 438 g/kg diet), hull (KMH; 78 g/kg diet) as well as cotyledons of 'White' faba bean (VFWC; 470 g/kg diet) and hull (VFWH; 82 g/kg diet) fractions were tested. All diets were made isocaloric and isonitrogenous, however, without addition of individual amino acids to the target requirements. Performance of rats fed on both locally grown KSM and exotic FBW meal-fed rats were found to be inferior to those obtained from the rats fed on standard protein diet. The net protein utilization (NPU) of the rats fed on this seed meal was comparatively better than those obtained from the VFW. Replacement of standard protein with cotyledons from the either of the seed (KMC and VFWC) depressed food intake and protein utilization. This was due, in part, to the excretion of comparatively higher amount of nitrogen in faeces. Inclusion of KMH in the diet had no adverse effects on any variable studies as compared to the VFWH, which was found to impose severe restriction on the absorption of standard protein added to this diet. As a result, body weight gain, and NPU value were significantly lower than those obtained from the KMH. We conclude that the locally grown faba bean 'Kalimattar' is better than those of exotic 'White' cultivar and may contain less antinutritional substances. However, this warrants further investigations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mortuza", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Newaz", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hossain", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "9432922", "ISSNLinking": "0963-7486"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritional Requirements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Long-Evans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10746099", "10.1080/096374800100840"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
