The essential oils are a mixture of several volatile compounds mainly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes obtained from different parts of P. lentiscus by hydrodistillation. The variability of chemical composition,biological activities and content of essential oil is strongly affected by extraction technology,environmental and sex factors. It is indicated that essential oils of P. lentiscus have kinds of biological activities such as antibacterial,anticancer,anti-atherogenesis,antioxidant,anti-inflammatory and insecticidal activities.Many scholars hold the opinion that combination of different components with synergistic and/or additive actions should account for their biological activities. Due to its diverse efficacy and special taste,the essential oil of P. lentiscus has been extensively used in medicine,food and cosmetics industries. A mini review of chemical constituents and biological activities of essential oil of P. lentiscus in the past20 years is made here to provide valuable reference for the construction of \" the Belt and Road\"."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Natural Product Chemistry and Application at Universities of Education Department of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,Yili Normal University Yining 835000,China Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone and State Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization,Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry,Chinese Academy of Sciences Urumqi 830011,China University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing 100049,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone and State Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization,Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry,Chinese Academy of Sciences Urumqi 830011,China University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing 100049,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yu-Shuang", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone and State Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization,Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry,Chinese Academy of Sciences Urumqi 830011,China University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing 100049,China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone and State Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization,Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry,Chinese Academy of Sciences Urumqi 830011,China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Yan-Ru", "Initials": "YR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone and State Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization,Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry,Chinese Academy of Sciences Urumqi 830011,China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pistacia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31602940", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190529.201"]}}]}
