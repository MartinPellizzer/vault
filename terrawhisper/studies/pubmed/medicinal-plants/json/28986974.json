Despite a growing number of laboratories focused on cannabis analysis, the separation science literature pertaining to the determination of cannabis natural products is still in its infancy despite the plant having been utilized by humans for nearly 30 000 years and it being now the most widely used drug worldwide. This is largely attributable to the restrictions associated with cannabis as it is characterized as a schedule 1 drug in the United States. Presented here are reviewed analytical methods for the determination of cannabinoids (primarily) and terpenes (secondarily), the primary natural products of interest in cannabis plants. Focus is placed foremost on analyses from plant extracts and the various instrumentation and techniques that are used, but some coverage is also given to analysis of cannabinoid metabolites found in biological fluids. The goal of this work is to provide a collection of relevant separation science information, upon which the field of cannabis analysis can continue to grow."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
