Nevertheless, an effective treatment strategy for ALI is yet to be developed. Zerumbone, a sesquiterpene isolated from Zingiber zerumbet Smith, possesses several advantageous bioeffects such as antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and antiulcer. Pretreatment of zerumbone inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced arterial blood gas exchange, neutrophils infiltration, and increased pulmonary vascular permeability. LPS-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was inhibited by zerumbone at a lower concentration than that of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). In addition, proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 were suppressed by zerumbone. The phosphorylation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB, a proinflammatory transcription factor, and degradation of inhibitor of \u03baB (I\u03baB), an inhibitor of NF-\u03baB, were also reduced by zerumbone. Furthermore, we found the inhibitory concentration of zerumbone on phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) was lower than that of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). In conclusion, zerumbone could be a potential protective agent for ALI, possibly via expression of ICAM-1, IL-1\u03b2, and MIP-2. The protective mechanism of zerumbone was by reversing the activation of p38 MAPK/JNK-I\u03baB/NF-\u03baB pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 by The Chinese Physiological Society."},
