Ulcer index, severity of inflammation, colonic levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA), and histological changes were recorded after the treatment regimen of 4 days.", "The ulcer index, severity of inflammation and colonic MDA levels were increased following intrarectal instillation of acetic acid. Also, acetic acid significantly decreased the SOD and GSH levels. Treatment with Mumiju for 4 days exhibited significantly lowered oxidative stress, while elevated of SOD and GSH levels.
