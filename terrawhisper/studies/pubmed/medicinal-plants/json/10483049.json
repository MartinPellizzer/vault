Pre-clinical animals studies suggest that hypericum is effective in three major biochemical systems relevant for antidepressant activity, namely the inhibition of the synaptic re-uptake system for serotonin (5-HT), noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA). It is the only antidepressant capable of inhibiting the re-uptake of 5-HT, NA and DA with similar potencies. The potencies for monoamine re-inhibition and chronic changes in receptors are also consistent with changes seen with known antidepressants. Behavioral studies suggest that hypericum is active in pre-clinical animal models of depression with comparable effects to known antidepressants. Supporting the pre-clinical pharmacology and efficacy, many clinical studies have shown that hypericum has superior efficacy compared to placebo and comparable efficacy to standard antidepressants in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression. The advantage of hypericum over other antidepressants may result from its favorable side-effect profile. Although pre-clinical and short-term clinical studies demonstrate antidepressant activity, the lack of long-term use and efficacy, and the heterogeneity of patients, interventions, extract preparations from previous clinical studies suggests that more careful and controlled studies are needed to determine the long-term efficacy of hypericum in mild-to-moderate depression."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Brain Sciences Institute, Swinburne University of Technology, 400 Burwood Road, Hawthorn 3122, Victoria, Australia. pnathan@bsi.swin.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nathan", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Mol Psychiatry", "NlmUniqueID": "9607835", "ISSNLinking": "1359-4184"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Biogenic Amine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.3.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoamine Oxidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depression"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ericales"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Monoamine Oxidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Biogenic Amine"}], "NumberOfReferences": "68"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10483049", "10.1038/sj.mp.4000557"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
