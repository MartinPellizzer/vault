In the last years, the phytochemical composition of more than 20 species of officinal plants extensively cultivated in this country has been studied in the Department of General Chemistry, I.M.Sechenov Moscow Medical Academy. Oil content, composition of fatty acids, and tocopherol levels were determined in various plant tissues. The data obtained were used to improve normative documentation on raw materials, pharmaceutical substances, and medicinal agents. General technical approaches to the standardization of phy-topreparations were realized in the research carried out by the Department to develop methods for quality control of stomatological materials and therapeutic agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Popkov", "ForeName": "V A", "Initials": "VA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nesterova", "ForeName": "O V", "Initials": "OV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Vestn Ross Akad Med Nauk", "NlmUniqueID": "9215641", "ISSNLinking": "0869-6047"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dental Materials"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Structures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}], "NumberOfReferences": "8"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19143080"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
