The chemical constituents from Fukeqianjin formula were studied in this paper. The compounds were separated and purified by repeated column chromatographic methods including silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, macroporous adsorptive resin, and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. And their chemical structures were determined by spectral data analyses. Thirty-eight compounds were obtained and identified as Z-3-butylidenephthalide (1), Z-ligustilide (2), senkyunolide I (3), senkyunolide H (4), vanillin (5), 7-O-methylwogonin (6), wogonin (7), panicolin (8), 19-hydroxy-8(17),13-labdadien-15,16-olide (9), andrograpanin (3,14-dideoxyandrographolide; 10), andrographolide (11), 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide (12), isoandrographolide (13), andrographin (2'-O-methylskullcapflavone, 14), biochanin A (15), 5-hydroxy-7,8,2',5'-tetramethoxyflavone (16), formononetin (17), daidzein (18), genistein (19), benzoic acid (20), vanillic acid (21), trans-ferulic acid (22), salicylic acid (23), daidzin (24), genistein-7-O-\u03b2-D-apiofuranosyl-(1\u21926)-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (25), apigenin-7-O-\u03b2-D-glucuronide (26), andrographidin C (27), apigenin-7-O-\u03b2-D-(6\"-methyl)glucuronide (28), neoandrographolide (29), genistin (30), andrographiside (31), 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographiside (32), lobetyolin (33), epicatechin (34), catechin (35), palmatine (36), berberine (37), and jatrorrhizine (38), respectively. From the results of an individual medicinal material studies, it can be judged that compounds 17, 19, 24 and 30 as flavonoids came from the roots of M. macrophylla, compounds 36-38 as alkaloids came from the caulis of M. fortunei, compounds 6-8, 14, 16, and 27 as flavonoids as well as 9-13, 29, 31, and 32 as diterpenes came from the aerial parts of A. paniculata, compound 5 as phenols came from the roots of Z. dissitum, compounds 1-4 as phthalides as well as compound 22 as phenylpropanoids came from the roots of A. sinensis, compound 33 as alkynes came from the roots of C. pilosula, compounds 15, 17-19 as flavonoids as well as compound 21 as phenolic acids came from the caulis of S. suberectus. While compounds 34 and 35 as flavanoids could come from both the caulis of S. suberectus and roots of R. laevigata. The chemical composition of traditional Chinese medicine compound can be tracked from the original sources. This work provides a demonstration for the material basis study of traditional Chinese medicine compound.
