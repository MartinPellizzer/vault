Activation of oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways are contributory to the development of CVD. Pharmacological activities of vanillic acid have been investigated suggesting that they may have therapeutic utility clinically. Given its phenolic nature, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of vanillic acid have been shown to exert potent inhibitory activity against Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK), Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF- \u03baB), the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), Nod-like receptor family protein (NLRP), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), Mitogen-Activated Signaling Proteins (MAPK) and Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways. Vanillic acid has been shown to block pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppress inflammatory cascades. The inhibitory impact of vanillic acid on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxygen synthase (iNOS) expression has also been demonstrated. Vanillic acid reduces oxidative-related markers such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). Here, we review the cardioprotective effects and mechanisms of action of vanillic acid in CVD. Current potential applications of vanillic acid in CVD are discussed concerning preclinical and clinical studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology & Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Lashgari", "ForeName": "Naser-Aldin", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology & Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Roudsari", "ForeName": "Nazanin M", "Initials": "NM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Institute of Medicinal Plants, ACECR, Karaj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology and Diseases Group (TDG), Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center (PSRC), The Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (TIPS), and Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gastrointestinal Pharmacology Interest Group (GPIG), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Momtaz", "ForeName": "Saeideh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology & Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Institute of Medicinal Plants, ACECR, Karaj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology and Diseases Group (TDG), Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center (PSRC), The Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (TIPS), and Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gastrointestinal Pharmacology Interest Group (GPIG), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abdolghaffari", "ForeName": "Amir H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Postgraduate Studies and Research, RCSI Medical University of Bahrain, Busaiteen, Kingdom of Bahrain."}], "LastName": "Atkin", "ForeName": "Stephen L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Biomedical Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sahebkar", "ForeName": "Amirhossein", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "GM8Q3JM2Y8", "NameOfSubstance": "Vanillic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-E2-Related Factor 2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Vanillic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-E2-Related Factor 2"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "5"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36045525", "10.2174/0929867329666220831152608", "CMC-EPUB-126058"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
