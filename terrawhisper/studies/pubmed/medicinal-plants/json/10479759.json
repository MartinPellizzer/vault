(=barbadensis Miller) is presented. The fraction showing haemagglutinating activity was precipitated at 50% ammonium sulphate concentration from the crude leaf pulp extract. The precipitate thus obtained, after dialysis, was applied to a hydroxylapatite column. Stepwise elution resulted in two peaks showing haemagglutinating activity eluted with 5 mM (Aloctin I) and 20 mM (Aloctin II) phosphate buffers. Haemagglutinating activity was estimated visually by adding a 4% rabbit erythrocyte suspension to serial two-fold dilutions of the lectins in microtitration plates. None of the 20 sugars tested inhibited haemag--glutinating activity of Aloctin I up a concentration of 500 mM. Aloctin II was inhibited by N-acetyl-D--galactosamine at 250 mM concentration. Of 10 metal ions tested, only Al(3+) salts were found to activate Aloctin I and II. On the other hand, it was shown that neither lectin possessed any alpha- and beta- galactosidase or alpha- and beta- glucosidase activity. The lectins were of glycoprotein structure containing approximately 5% neutral sugar. The specificity of the lectins towards human and rat erythrocytes was investigated."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Istanbul, 34452 Universite, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Akev", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Can", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ABO Blood-Group System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Rh-Hr Blood-Group System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "ABO Blood-Group System"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Aloe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemagglutination Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rh-Hr Blood-Group System"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10479759", "10.1002/(sici)1099-1573(199909)13:6<489::aid-ptr499>3.0.co;2-5", "10.1002/(SICI)1099-1573(199909)13:6<489::AID-PTR499>3.0.CO;2-5"]}}]}
