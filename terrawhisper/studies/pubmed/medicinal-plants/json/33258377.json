However, the exact effect of -CH<sub>3</sub>/-CF<sub>3</sub> substitution on bioactivity is still controversial. We compiled a data set containing 28\u202f003 pairs of compounds with the only difference that -CH<sub>3</sub> is substituted by -CF<sub>3</sub>, and the statistical results showed that the replacement of -CH<sub>3</sub> with -CF<sub>3</sub> does not improve bioactivity on average. Yet, 9.19% substitution of -CH<sub>3</sub> by -CF<sub>3</sub> could increase the biological activity by at least an order. A PDB survey revealed that -CF<sub>3</sub> prefers Phe, Met, Leu, and Tyr, while -CH<sub>3</sub> prefers Leu, Met, Cys, and Ile. If we substitute the -CH<sub>3</sub> by -CF<sub>3</sub> near Phe, His, and Arg, the bioactivity is most probably improved. We performed QM/MM calculations for 39 -CH<sub>3</sub>/-CF<sub>3</sub> pairs of protein-ligand complexes and found that the -CH<sub>3</sub>/-CF<sub>3</sub> substitution does achieve a large energy gain in some systems, although the mean energy difference is subtle, which is consistent with the statistical survey. The -CF<sub>3</sub> substitution on the benzene ring could be particularly effective at gaining binding energy. The maximum improvements in energy achieved -4.36 kcal/mol by QM/MM calculation. Moreover, energy decompositions from MM/GBSA calculations showed that the large energy gains for the -CH<sub>3</sub>/-CF<sub>3</sub> substitution are largely driven by the electrostatic energy or the solvation free energy. These findings may shed some light on the biological activity profile for -CH<sub>3</sub>/-CF<sub>3</sub> substitution, which should be useful for further drug discovery and drug design."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry in Arid Regions and Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, South Beijing Road 40-1, Urumqi, Xinjiang 830011, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research; Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Abula", "ForeName": "Amina", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3063-8473"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research; Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Zhijian", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9260-6226"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research; Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Zhengdan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research; Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Cheng", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research; Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhaoqiang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6699-5299"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research; Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Weiliang", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4652-6879"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry in Arid Regions and Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, South Beijing Road 40-1, Urumqi, Xinjiang 830011, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Aisa", "ForeName": "Haji Akber", "Initials": "HA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Inf Model", "NlmUniqueID": "101230060", "ISSNLinking": "1549-9596"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Static Electricity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "36"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33258377", "10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00898"]}}]}
