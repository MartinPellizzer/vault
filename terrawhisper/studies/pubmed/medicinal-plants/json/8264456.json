One of the most ubiquitous and loved symbols of Australia, and of Australian life and lore, indigenous wattles have also figured in the lives and memorials of medical practitioners. Some 20 indigenous Acacia species bear the names of medical explorers and clinical pioneers. This article documents some of the medical and related uses of Acacia by European and Aboriginal Australians and the evolution from this of a colonial herbal pharmacopoeia. It also gives brief pr\u00e9cis and illustrations of the medical practitioners whose lives and works are immortalised in Australian native species of Acacia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Child Health, Royal Children's Hospital, Brisbane, QLD."}], "LastName": "Pearn", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Med J Aust", "NlmUniqueID": "0400714", "ISSNLinking": "0025-729X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acacia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Australia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physicians"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Terminology as Topic"}], "NumberOfReferences": "43"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8264456"]}}]}
