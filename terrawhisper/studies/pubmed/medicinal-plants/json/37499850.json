Hutch (Papaveraceae), one of the most famous ethno-medicinal plants from the Bai communities in P. R. China, is used to treat various inflammations and tumours. Bioassay-guided phytochemical research on D. scandens followed by semi-synthesis led to a series of undescribed tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids with dual inhibitory activities against indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). The previously undescribed dark-green alkaloid dactycapnine A exhibited the best dual inhibitor effects among the identified compounds. Structure-activity relationship analysis revealed the importance of the base skeleton with a hyperconjugation system. The performed semi-synthesis further yielded bioactive dimeric and trimeric compounds with hyperconjugated systems. Performed STD NMR experiments disclosed direct interactions between dactycapnine A and IDO1/TDO. Inhibition kinetics indicated dactycapnine A as a mixed-type dual inhibitor. These findings provided a possible explanation for the anticancer properties of the ethno-medicinal plant species D. scandens."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
