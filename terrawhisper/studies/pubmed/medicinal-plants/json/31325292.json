However, the underlying mechanism has been unclear. Here, we investigated the potential inhibitory effects and mechanism of OMT on transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblast to myofibroblasts induced by aldosterone in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS The cardiac fibroblasts (CFBs) proliferation and migration capacity were evaluated by MTT assay, cell cycle assay, and scratch analysis, respectively. The protein expression of the Nrf2/Keap1 signal pathway, FN, Collagen I, Collagen III, alpha-SMA, CTGF, and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) protein was detected by Western blot analysis. The mRNA expression of Nrf2 was detected by qRT-PCR. Immunofluorescence staining was used to observe the expression of alpha-SMA protein. Nrf2 siRNA was used to explore the role of Nrf2 in OMT-treated CFBs. GSH, SOD, and MDA levels and hydroxyproline content were measured by colorimetric assay with commercial kits. The DCFH-DA fluorescent probe was used to assess cellular ROS levels. RESULTS OMT and Curcumin (an Nrf2 agonist) attenuated aldosterone (ALD)-induced proliferation and migration in CFBs, as well as the fibrosis-associated protein expression levels. Moreover, OMT activated Nrf2 and promoted the nucleus translocation of Nrf2. OMT alleviated the elevated levels of alpha-SMA, Collagen I, Collagen III, and CTGF, which were abrogated by the Nrf2 siRNA transfection. We also found that OMT decreased oxidative stress levels. CONCLUSIONS Our results confirm that OMT alleviates transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts induced by aldosterone via activating the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway in vitro."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Department of Pharmacognosy (The State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, The High Educational Key Laboratory of Guizhou Province for Natural Medicinal Pharmacology and Druggability), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, University Town, Guiyang, Guizhou, China (mainland)."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Department of Pharmacology of Materia Medica (The High Efficacy Application of Natural Medicinal Resources Engineering Center of Guizhou Province, Union Key Laboratory of Guiyang City -
