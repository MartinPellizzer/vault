The effects of flow rate and concentration of perfusate on the recovery rate were investigated by the concentration difference method(increment method and decrement method). The microdialysis samples at different time points were collected, and the concentrations of three index components were determined by UPLC-MS/MS. The actual drug concentrations were corrected with the in vivo recovery rate, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by WinNonlin 8.2. In the in vitro recovery test, the recovery rate measured by the increment method and the decrement method was inversely proportional to the flow rate and independent of the concentration. The pharmacokinetic parameter AUC_(0-t) values of 3-O-caffeoyl quinic acid, 4-O-caffeoyl quinic acid, and 5-O-caffeoyl quinic acid were(23 911.23\u00b15 679.67),(16 688.43\u00b13 448.45), and(9 677.02\u00b11 606.74) min\u00b7\u03bcg\u00b7L~(-1), respectively. C_(max) values were(170.66\u00b158.02),(121.61\u00b148.14), and(69.69\u00b118.23) \u03bcg\u00b7L~(-1), respectively. The UPLC-MS/MS method has the advantages of specificity, rapidity, high sensitivity, and accurate quantification. It can simultaneously determine the concentration of 3-O-caffeoyl quinic acid and other two index components in microdialysis samples and is suitable for the pharmacokinetics study of the three index components of P. forrestii in normal rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou Province, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Pu", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou Province, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Wen-Sha", "Initials": "WS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou Province, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou Province, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yue-Ting", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Chi", "ForeName": "Ming-Yan", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou Province, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Zi-Peng", "Initials": "ZP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou Province, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "058C04BGYI", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Periploca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microdialysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quinic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "23"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36604877", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220621.201"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
