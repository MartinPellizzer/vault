As a water-soluble carotenoid, crocin is a pharmacologically active constituent of C. sativus L. (saffron).", "In the present study, we investigated the effects of crocin-loaded niosomes (Cro-NIO) compared to free crocin on PQ-induced toxicity in the eukaryotic human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell line.", "The Cro-NIO was synthesized and characterized. Cell viability was determined using the MTT assay in PQ-exposed HEK293 cell lines. The activities of biochemical markers were quantitatively determined to reveal the potential mechanism of PQ-induced oxidative stress in HEK293 cell line.", "The particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index (PDI), DL, and EE of Cro-NIO were 145.4 \u00b1 19.5 nm, -22.3 \u00b1 3.11 mV, 0.3 \u00b1 0.03, 1.74 \u00b1 0.01%, and 55.3 \u00b1 7.1%, respectively. PQtreated HEK293 cell lines decreased cell viability. The results of oxidative status showed that PQ significantly could increase ROS accumulation, accompanied by a decreasing antioxidant defense system. However, treatment with Cro-NIO, compared to crocin, not only did dose-dependently improve the cell viability but also significantly attenuated the ROS accumulation and increased antioxidant markers.", "According to these results, Cro-NIO, compared to crocin, was superior to ameliorating PQ-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative damage in HEK293 cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Oftadeh Harsin", "ForeName": "Akram", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4066-7040"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Makhdoomi", "ForeName": "Sajjad", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soliemani", "ForeName": "Meysam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Science, Iran."}], "LastName": "Firozian", "ForeName": "Farzin", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nili-Ahmadabadi", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ranjbar", "ForeName": "Akram", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101623431", "ISSNLinking": "2211-7385"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38317468", "10.2174/0122117385256493231019045141", "PNT-EPUB-137411"]}}]}
