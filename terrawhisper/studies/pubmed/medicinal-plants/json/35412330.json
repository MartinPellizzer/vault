It contains chemical compounds used for antimicrobial, antioxidant, antitumor, antiemetic and wound healing (Patel, 2017). In July 2021, 'Pokok Bakung' leaves with anthracnose symptoms were collected from a park of Universiti Malaysia Sabah in the Sabah province. The disease severity was about 100% with 20% incidence. Red spots were primarily found on the leaf surfaces. Anthracnose developed as the disease progressed, and acervuli were observed in the spots. Small pieces of infected leaves (5 x 5 mm) were excised from spot margins, surface sterilized based on Khoo et al. (2022a), placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) in Petri dishes, which were incubated for 5 days at 25\u00b0C in the dark. The colonies formed on the PDA plates were abundant with gray-white fluffy mycelia after 5 days, and the reverse view revealed brown. UMS01, a representative isolate, was used to morphologically and molecularly characterize the fungus. Conidia were one-celled, cylindrical, hyaline, smooth, and blunt at the ends, measuring 13.8 to 16.5 x 3.6 to 6.7 \u00b5m (n = 20). Appressoria ranged in size from 7.6 to 9.3 x 5.5 to 6.9 \u00b5m (n= 20) and were ovoid to clavate, spherical to irregular in shape and dark brown in color. Genomic DNA was extracted from fresh mycelia of isolate UMS01 based on Khoo et al. (2021) with the addition of mechanical disruption using a micro pestle before heating at 95\u00b0C. PCR amplification was performed based on Khoo et al. (2022a) using ITS1/ITS4, CL1C/CL2C, ACT-512F/ACT-783R, CHS-79F/CHS-354R, and GDF1/GDR1 primer pairs to amplify the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, calmodulin (<i>CAL</i>), actin (<i>ACT</i>), chitin synthase (<i>CHS-1</i>), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<i>GAPDH</i>) (Weir et al. 2012). PCR products with positive amplicons were sent to Apical Scientific Sdn. Bhd. for sequencing. The sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers OK458683 (ITS), OL953033 (<i>CAL</i>), OL953030 (<i>ACT</i>), OL953036 (<i>CHS-1</i>), and OL953039 (<i>GAPDH</i>). Before BLAST, the search set were adjusted to exclude model sequences (XM/XP) and the uncultured/environmental sample sequences, and limit to sequences from type material. They were 99-100% similar to the <i>Colletotrichum siamense</i> ITS (JX010171), <i>CAL</i> (JX009714), <i>ACT</i> (FJ907423) and <i>CHS-1</i> (JX009865), and Colletotrichum changpingense <i>GAPDH</i> (MZ664048) type sequences. The <i>GAPDH</i> marker did not reliably resolve the relationships within the <i>C. gloeosporioides</i> complex (Vieira et al. 2020). Phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood based on the combined ITS, <i>CAL</i>, <i>ACT</i>, <i>CHS-1</i> and <i>GAPDH</i> indicated that the isolate formed a supported clade (100% bootstrap value) to the most related <i>C. siamense</i>. Morphological and molecular characterization matched the description of <i>C. siamense</i> (Huang et al. 2021). Pathogenicity tests were performed to fulfil Koch's postulates by spraying a spore suspension (10<sup>6</sup> spores/ml) on the leaves of three healthy four-month-old 'Pokok Bakung' plants, while three additional plants were sprayed with water as a control. The inoculated plants were covered with plastics for 48 h at 25\u00b0C in the dark. Incubation was performed based on Iftikhar et al. (2022). Symptoms similar to those of the field collection occurred after 6 days post inoculation. No symptoms occurred on the control plants. The experiment was repeated two more times. The reisolated fungal isolates were identical to <i>C. siamense</i> morphologically and molecularly. Previously, <i>C. siamense</i> has been reported to cause anthracnose on <i>Allamanda cathartica</i> (Huang et al. 2021) and avocado (Li et al. 2022) in China, and 'Purple Dream' eggplant in Malaysia (Khoo et al. 2022b). <i>Colletotrichum fructicola</i> has been reported to cause anthracnose on <i>C. asiaticum</i> in China (Qing et al. 2020). To our knowledge, this is the first report of <i>C. siamense</i> causing anthracnose on <i>C. asiaticum</i> in Malaysia. Our findings expand the geographic range of <i>C. siamense</i> and indicate that it could be a potential threat limiting the growth and production of <i>C. asiaticum</i> in Malaysia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 12661, Institute of Plant Protection, No. 2 West Yuanmingyuan Rd.,, Haidian District, Beijing, China, 100193."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universiti Malaysia Sabah, 60606, Faculty Of Science And Natural Resources, Jalan UMS, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia, 88400; khooyingwei@outlook.com."}], "LastName": "Khoo", "ForeName": "Ying Wei", "Initials": "YW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universiti Putra Malaysia Institute of Bioscience, 534340, AQUAHEALTH LAB, Aquahealth, Institut Biosains, UPM, 43400 Serdang, Selangor, TRIANG, Selangor, Malaysia, 28300."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NO.16, TAMAN SELAYANG; huiteng.tan28@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Hui Teng", "ForeName": "Tan", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universiti Putra Malaysia, 37449, Laboratory of Aquatic Animal Health and Therapeutics, Institute of Bioscience, Jalan Universiti 1, Serdang, Malaysia, Malaysia, 43400; yskhaw@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Khaw", "ForeName": "Yam Sim", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Biology of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests, Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yuanmingyuan west No2,Haidian District, Beijing, China, 100094; sfli@ippcaas.cn."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shifang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universiti Malaysia Sabah, 60606, Faculty of Science and Natural Resources, Jalan UMS, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia, 88400; chongkp@ums.edu.my."}], "LastName": "Chong", "ForeName": "Khim Phin", "Initials": "KP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "11"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["35412330", "10.1094/PDIS-12-21-2779-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
