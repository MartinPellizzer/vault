Within the present study, the effects of pure and nanoemulsified essential oil derived from Satureja Khuzistanica essential oil (SKEO) on Escherichia coli (E. coli ATCC 25922) as a human pathogen has been studied using a microfluidic chip. The morphology and antibacterial activity of E. coli at disparate residence durations (from 2 to 30\u00a0min) and various nanoemulsified or pure essential oil concentrations (8.0-62.5\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>) and numerous nanoemulsion's droplet sizes from 32 to 124\u00a0nm, have been investigated in the microfluidic system. Also, the quantitative analysis including optical density, time killing assay, protein, nucleic acid and potassium release were employed to confirm the effects of bacterial inhibition taking advantage of the chip apparatus. It was revealed that the prepared nanoemulsion left a considerable destructive effect on E. coli bacterial membrane, confirmed by fast release of cytoplasmic elements including protein, nucleic acid and potassium. However, this process was remarkably intensified for both nanoemulsion and pure essential oil using the microfluidic chip versus the conventional methods. The results also revealed that after 4\u00a0min of bacterium treatment by 12.5\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> nanoemulsion with 32\u00a0nm mean particle size, the bacterial membrane wall began to degrade rapidly, and bacterial activity was almost completely inhibited in a 20-min period. These findings may have implications in the similarly structured and phospholipid-encapsulated bacteria and viruses, like COVID-19."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
