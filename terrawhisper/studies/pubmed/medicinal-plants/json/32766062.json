Lymphedema is the result of obstructed lymphatic flow secondary to chronic infection, parasitic infestation, or postsurgical obstruction (eg, after axillary dissections). We arranged this clinical trial to investigate whether patients with limb lymphedema can benefit from a standard dose of <i>Astragalus</i> plus <i>Paeoniae rubra</i> to improve the symptomatology, functional capacity, and quality of life (QOL).", "The pilot study was designed as a self-control clinical trial. Patients with post-mastectomy lymphedema were recruited. A double-herb formulation (<i>Astragalus, Paeoniae rubra</i>) with standard dosage was administered orally in a powdered form, 6 times per week for 6 months. Outcome measurements included standard limb volume changes measured by water displacement method; handgrip strength; and QOL for limb lymphedema questionnaire (LYMQOL).", "There were no reported adverse effects or complications; there were no episodes of infection during the period of study. There was a tendency of limb volume reduction by 6 months, which, however, did not reach statistical significance. There was a significant improvement in appearance and symptom scores as was assessed with the LYMQOL questionnaire.", "The oral herbal formula improved the symptomatology and QOL among the pilot group of patients with post-mastectomy lymphedema. Side effects were absent, and there was a trend of lymphedema reduction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
