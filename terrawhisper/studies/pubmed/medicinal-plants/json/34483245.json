The development of new drugs is crucial for safer and more effective clinical management of both disorders. Riparin A is a synthetic chemical analog of riparins that naturally occur in several medicinal plants. Marked pharmacological effects such as anxiolytic and antidepressant properties characterize this class of compounds. However, little is known about the potential anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of Riparin A. In this work, we showed that, unlike other riparins, Riparin A exerts only a very mild anxiolytic-like effect as demonstrated by the results of classical behavioral tests such as the elevated plus-maze, light-dark box and open-field tests in rats. However, all doses of Riparin A (2.5; 5.0 and 10 mg/kg; intraperitoneal) have shown significant antidepressant activity in rats submitted to forced swimming test. In addition to this interesting pharmacological property, Riparin A did not promote any important alterations in the locomotor performance of the animals as specifically demonstrated by the rotarod test. Furthermore, Riparin A did not induce sedation in treated animals; instead, this compound appears to increase the animal's state of alertness as measured by the latency time to loss of reflexes and time to recovery from sleep in rats submitted to the pentobarbital-induced sleep time test. The present results point to an antidepressant effect of Riparin A and reinforce the pharmaceutical interest in the group of riparins, particularly their high potential for use in new studies investigating the structure-activity relationships between member compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.
