Based on climate factors and soil types of P. notoginseng from 326 sampling sites, which cover both traditional and current major producing regions, as well as on the results of the ecological similarity computing analysis, we obtained the maximum ecological similarity areas for P. notoginseng worldwide. The results indicated that China was the most suitable ecological and cultivated area globally for P. notoginseng, accounting for more than 70% of the total cultivated area in the world. The United States, Brazil, Portugal, and other 22 countries also had a small amount of potential suitable producing area. China has eight potential suitable producing provinces, including Yunnan, Fujian, Guangxi, Guizhou, etc. The prediction is consistent with the new district of P. notoginseng reported in recent years, which verifies the accuracy of the prediction of GMPGIS. We conducted a literature analysis on resource regeneration and quality ecology on P. notoginseng, and summarized the cultivation, wild tending models, and effects of environmental factors on the quality of P. notoginseng. The results provide scientific basis for selection of P. notoginseng, as well as the introduction, cultivation, and production of P. notoginseng worldwide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Xiang-xiao", "Initials": "XX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lin-fang", "Initials": "LF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Lin-lin", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xi-wen", "Initials": "XW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Fu-gang", "Initials": "FG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhong-jian", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Cheng-zhong", "Initials": "CZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Yu-qi", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shi-lin", "Initials": "SL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecology"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Panax notoginseng"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29924558"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
