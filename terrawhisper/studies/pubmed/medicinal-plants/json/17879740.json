The morphological changes of the neurons before and after administration of TEN were examined under a phase contrast microscope. Neuronal viabilities were detected by MTT colorimetry. Injuring degrees of the neuronal membrane were assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) colorimetry.", "As compared with the normal control, treatment of primary cultural neurons with Ap, (25 micromol x L(-1)) for 24 h caused a significant decrease in viabilities and morphological changes of nerve cells, with neurons losing adherent ability or shedding, and the synapse shortening found by microscope. The percentage of apoptotic nerve cells and the LDH leakage were significantly decreased, and the survival rate of neurons was significantly increased in both the TEN high and medium dose groups.", "The aggregated Abeta(1-40) has a definite neurotoxicity for cultural cortical neurons, and TEN can significantly protect the neurons from the cytotoxicity of Abeta(1-40)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science, Anhui University, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of R&D of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230039, China. chenqin169@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Lei-ke", "Initials": "LK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "amyloid beta-protein (1-40)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "06S1QH951L", "NameOfSubstance": "tenuigenin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Cerebral Cortex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colorimetry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neurons"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polygala"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17879740"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
