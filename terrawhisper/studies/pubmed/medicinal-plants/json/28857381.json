Herein, a sulfur-doped Fe/N/C catalyst (denoted as Fe/SNC) was obtained by a template-sacrificing method. The incorporated sulfur gives a thiophene-like structure (C-S-C), reduces the electron localization around the Fe centers, improves the interaction with oxygenated species, and therefore facilitates the complete 4\u2005e<sup>-</sup> ORR in acidic solution. Owing to these synergistic effects, the Fe/SNC catalyst exhibits much better ORR activity than the sulfur-free variant (Fe/NC) in 0.5\u2009m H<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub> ."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
