Three meal tests with an intake of 90 g of white bread (50 g of carbohydrates) were performed on each subject. In one test, 200 mg of acarbose was given, while 15 g of P. psyllium mucilage was given in another test, and only bread was ingested in the control test. Serum glucose and insulin concentrations were measured every 30 min from 0-180 min. Net area under curve (AUC) concentrations of glucose and insulin, GI and insulinic index were calculated.", "In NIDDM patients, AUC-glucose in the test with acarbose (1.9 +/- 0.7 mmol/L) and with P. psyllium (4.3 +/- 1.2 mmol/L) were significantly lower than in the control test (7.4 +/- 1.5 mmol/L) (p < 0.01). GI of bread plus acarbose was 26 +/- 13, and of bread plus P. psyllium, 59 +/- 10 (p < 0.05). AUC-insulin and insulinic index behave similarly. In healthy individuals, AUC-glucose and GI did not significantly change with the treatments; however, insulinic index with acarbose was 17 +/- 16, and with P. psyllium was 68 +/- 15 (p < 0.05). Acarbose or P. psyllium decreased GI of bread in NIDDM patients and diminished insulinic index in NIDDM and in healthy subjects.", "Adding acarbose or P. psyllium to meals may reduce glycemic index of carbohydrate foods and may help diabetic control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Medicina Interna, Hospital de Especialidades, M\u00e9xico, D.F."}], "LastName": "Frati Munari", "ForeName": "A C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ben\u00edtez Pinto", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ra\u00fal Ariza Andraca", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Casarrubias", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Med Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9312706", "ISSNLinking": "0188-4409"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trisaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T58MSI464G", "NameOfSubstance": "Acarbose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acarbose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bread"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Trisaccharides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9650328"]}}]}
