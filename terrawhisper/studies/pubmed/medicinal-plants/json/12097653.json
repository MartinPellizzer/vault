We examined the antiobesity effects of the hot water-soluble extract (SRHW) from the roots of S. reticulata using obese rat models and an in vitro study. Body weight (P = 0.07) and periuterine fat storage (P = 0.10) in female Zucker fatty rats (8-9 wk old) tended to be suppressed by oral administration of SRHW (125 mg/kg) for 27 d. Male rats fed a high fat diet were not affected by SRHW. Furthermore, SRHW inhibited porcine pancreatic lipase (PL), rat adipose tissue-derived lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activities with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of 264 (95% confidence limits: 203-393) mg/L, 15 (12-18) mg/L and 54 (35-85) mg/L, respectively, but did not inhibit hormone-sensitive lipase activity in rat adipose tissue. Next, we examined the effects of polyphenols, di- and triterpenes and salacinol isolated from the roots of S. reticulata on lipid metabolizing enzymes and lipolysis. (-)-Epigallocatechin and (-)-epicatechin-(4beta-->8)-(-)-4'-O-methylepigallocatechin inhibited PL activity with IC(50) of 88 (not calculated) and 68 (26-122) mg/L, respectively. (-)-Epicatechin, 3beta, 22beta-dihydroxyolean-12-en-29-oic acid and the tannin fraction inhibited LPL activity with IC(50) of 81 (54-214), 89 (62-214) and 35 (24-62) mg/L. Only the tannin fraction inhibited GPDH activity with an IC(50) of 6.8 (3.4-10.9) mg/L. These constituents may be involved in the lipase and GPDH inhibitory activities of SRHW. On the other hand, SRHW at 100 mg/L tended to enhance lipolysis in rat adipocytes (P = 0.06). Significant lipolytic effects were exerted by mangiferin, (-)-4'-O-methylepigallocatechin and maytenfolic acid at 100 mg/L (P < 0.01). In conclusion, polyphenolic compounds may be involved in the antiobesity effects of SRHW in rats through inhibition of fat metabolizing enzymes (PL, LPL and GPDH) and enhanced lipolysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, Misasagi, Yamashina-ku, Japan. shoyaku@mb.kyoto-phu.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoshikawa", "ForeName": "Masayuki", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shimoda", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishida", "ForeName": "Norihisa", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takada", "ForeName": "Miki", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsuda", "ForeName": "Hisashi", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycerolphosphate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.3", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Adipose Tissue"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Glycerolphosphate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Lipase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Zucker"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12097653", "10.1093/jn/132.7.1819"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
