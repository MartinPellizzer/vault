Recent studies have shown that it has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. In addition, oxidative stress and inflammation induced by solar ultraviolet radiation is a very significant reason for skin depigmentation. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the effect of 3,5-diCQA on B16 cells and explored its molecular mechanism. Results showed that 3,5-diCQA upregulated intracellular melanin production in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Tyrosinase (TYR) activity was also increased after treatment with 3,5-diCQA in a dose-dependent manner. Expressions of TYR, TYR-related protein1, TYR-related protein2, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor were upregulated in a dose-dependent manner after 48 h of treatment with 3,5-diCQA. Results also showed that 3,5-diCQA promoted the phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 at Ser 9. Moreover, 3,5-diCQA increased the content of \u03b2-catenin in cell cytoplasm and nucleus by reducing the content of phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin (p-\u03b2-catenin). All these results suggest that 3,5-diCQA may mediate the acceleration of melanin synthesis by the \u03b2-catenin signal pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author 2017.
