Since it shares many common features with other HV, bovine HV type 1 (BoHV-1) was selected as a model to test the anti-herpesviral activity of medicinal plants.Fifteen plants were chosen in this study for their medical, antibacterial and antiviral proper-ties. The aim was to investigate ethanolic extracts from the selected medicinal plants for anti-BoHV-1 activity. The virucidal activities were evaluated by comparing the effect of noncy-totoxic concentrations of extracts on BoHV-1 strain 1640 replication in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. Virucidal activity was determined by means of virus titration after expo-sure to the extracts. The extract of Desmodium canadense was found to be the most effective virucide - the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) after exposure was 3.75 log10 and the virus reduction factor was \u22655.0\u00b10.25 log10. The extract of D. canadense was therefore chosen for further studies. Virus yield reduction assays showed that D. canadense extract had time-depen-dent and dose-dependent effects. It effectively reduced virus titre from 8.33 log10 to 4.67 log10(p\u27e80.01). The virucidal activity was also confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR), where the number of threshold cycles (Ct) was inversely proportional to the virus titre in TCID50 The virucidal activity was also confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR). This method showed that the number of threshold cycles (Ct) was inversely proportional to the virus titre (direct correlation with exposure time R=0.9321). The extract of D. canadense showed a high virus reduction capacity. In future, such active substances should be identified for the development of effective antivirals."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Polish Academy of Sciences."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Microbiology and Virology, Veterinary Faculty, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Tilzes 18, 47181, Kaunas, Lithuania."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Veterinary Faculty, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Tilzes 18, 47181, Kaunas, Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Lele\u0161ius", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Veterinary Faculty, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Tilzes 18, 47181, Kaunas, Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Girdauskait\u0117", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Veterinary Faculty, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Tilzes 18, 47181, Kaunas, Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Karpovait\u0117", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instrumental Analysis Open Access Centre, Vytautas Magnus University, Vileikos 8, 44404, Kaunas, Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Mickien\u0117", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instrumental Analysis Open Access Centre, Vytautas Magnus University, Vileikos 8, 44404, Kaunas, Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Drevinskas", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instrumental Analysis Open Access Centre, Vytautas Magnus University, Vileikos 8, 44404, Kaunas, Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Tiso", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plant Sector, Kaunas Botanical Garden of Vytautas Magnus University, Zilibero 6, 46324, Kaunas, Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Raga\u017einskien\u0117", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Sukileliu 13, 50162, Kaunas, Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Kubilien\u0117", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instrumental Analysis Open Access Centre, Vytautas Magnus University, Vileikos 8, 44404, Kaunas, Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Maru\u0161ka", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Veterinary Faculty, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Tilzes 18, 47181, Kaunas, Lithuania."}], "LastName": "\u0160alomskas", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Pol J Vet Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101125473", "ISSNLinking": "1505-1773"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Herpesvirus 1, Bovine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32627980", "10.24425/pjvs.2020.132763"]}}]}
