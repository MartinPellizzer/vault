The staining mixture is made by adding the following in the order given: lactic acid, 80 ml; 1% aqueous malachite green, 4 ml; 1% aqueous acid fuchsin, 6 ml; 1% aqueous aniline blue, 4 ml; 1% orange G in 50% alcohol, 2 ml; and chloral hydrate, 5 g. Pistils are fixed for 6 hr in modified Carnoy's fluid (absolute alcohol:chloroform:glacial acetic acid 6:4:1), hydrated in descending alcohols, transferred to stain and held there for 24 hr at 45 +/- 2 C. They were then transferred to a clearing and softening fluid containing 78 ml lactic acid, 10 g phenol, 10 g chloral hydrate and 2 ml 1% orange G. The pistils were held there for 24 hr at 45 +/- 2 C, hydrolyzed in the clearing and softening fluid at 58 +/- 1 C for 30 min, then stored in lactic acid for later use or immediately mounted in a drop of medium containing equal parts of lactic acid and glycerol for examination. Pollen tubes are stained dark blue to bluish red and stylar tissue light green to light greenish blue. This stain permits pollen tubes to be traced even up to their entry into the micropyle."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alexander", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Stain Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0404535", "ISSNLinking": "0038-9153"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Staining and Labeling"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2440149", "10.3109/10520298709107976"]}}]}
