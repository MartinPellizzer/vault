Urolithin B and auraptene have been reported to exert potent antioxidant effects - however, little is known about the protective effects of these compounds against QA-induced neurotoxicity. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the <i>in vitro</i> protective effects of urolithin B and auraptene against QA-induced neurotoxicity in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. The MTT assay was used to evaluate cell viability, and flow cytometry was carried out to evaluate effects on the cell cycle and apoptosis. The intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also determined. Our findings showed that auraptene at non-toxic concentrations had no protective effect on QA-induced toxicity. However, urolithin B at concentrations of 0.6 \u03bcM and 2.5 \u03bcM enhanced the viability of cells treated with QA. Moreover, while the percentage of apoptotic cells (i.e. in the sub-G1 phase) was shown to significantly increase after QA treatment, pre-treatment with urolithin B reduced the number of these apoptotic cells. Furthermore, urolithin B, as an antioxidant, also significantly reduced QA-induced ROS production. Our findings suggest that urolithin B may possess potent antioxidant and neuroprotective effects against QA-induced neurotoxicity that merit further investigation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, 37552Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbasinezhad-Moud", "ForeName": "Farzaneh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Diseases Research Center, 125609Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirzavi", "ForeName": "Farshad", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, 37552Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rakhshandeh", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, 48441Gonabad University of Medical Sciences, Gonabad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Biomedical Research Center, 37552Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohebbati", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Research Center, 37552Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Faculty of Medicine, 37552Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Forouzanfar", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, 37552Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jalili-Nik", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, 37552Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Azadi", "ForeName": "Nadia", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, 125609Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sanati", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, 196469North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Afshari", "ForeName": "Amir R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, 37552Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, 37552Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soukhtanloo", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Altern Lab Anim", "NlmUniqueID": "8110074", "ISSNLinking": "0261-1929"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "urolithin B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "F6F0HK1URN", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinolinic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "F79I1ZEL2E", "NameOfSubstance": "aurapten"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quinolinic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroblastoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36550678", "10.1177/02611929221146752"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
