The science surrounding dietary supplements has evolved substantially over the last few decades since their formal regulation in 1994. Much has been learned about the mechanisms of action of many dietary supplement ingredients, but the evidence on their health effects is still building. As is true of much nutrition research, there are many studies that point to health effects, but not all are at the level of scientific evidence (e.g., randomized controlled interventions), rigor, or quality needed for definitive statements of efficacy regarding clinical end points. New technologies and approaches are being applied to the science of dietary supplements, including nutrigenomics and microbiome analysis, data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning-all of which can elevate the science behind dietary supplements. Products can contain an array of bioactive compounds derived from foods as well as from medicinal plants, which creates enormous challenges in data collection and management. Clinical applications, particularly those aimed at providing personalized nutrition options for patients, have become more sophisticated as dietary supplements are incorporated increasingly into clinical practice and self-care. The goals of this article are to provide historical context for the regulation and science of dietary supplements, identify research resources, and suggest some future directions for science in this field."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
