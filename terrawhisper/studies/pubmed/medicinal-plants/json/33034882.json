Studies of genetic diversity of\u00a0S. persica\u00a0are rare relative to the large species diversity in Saudi Arabia, despite its valuable importance as one of the most popular medicinal plants. We investigate the genetic variability and genetic differentiation among and within wild Salvadora persica populations distributed in four regions of Saudi Arabia. Twelve sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) primers combination generated 326 alleles, with an average of 27.2 alleles per primer. All primers showed 100 polymorphism percentage, and higher PIC values exceeded 0.90. Jaccard similarity values varied between 0.04 to 0.43, with an average of 0.31, which showed a weak relationship among the accessions and their origin. Based on UGPMA and principal coordinate analysis, accessions collected from the same region showed less aggregation. Genetic diversity parameters showed that both Aflaj and Joodah populations recorded the highest mean values for the effective number of alleles (1.26 and 1.24). Shannon index and genetic heterozygosity (0.23 and 0.15 for both populations), and percent of polymorphism 45.45% for Aflaj and 43.87 for Joodah population. Most of the genetic variation was because of differences within populations (77%) and 23% among populations. SRAP markers explored the genetic diversity among and within\u00a0S. persica\u00a0populations. In this work, genetic diversity within populations was high, and the population structure was weak. We detected no specific geographic structure, which may reveal an active movement of plants among populations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7742-7801"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Science and Humanities, Department of Biology, Shaqra University, P.O.
