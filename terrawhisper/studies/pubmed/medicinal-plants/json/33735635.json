Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as omeprazole play a more dominant role in amelioration of GERD symptoms; nonetheless, there is a growing concern about their side effects. According to traditional Persian medicine (TPM), the use of rose oil is recommended to alleviate GERD symptoms.", "Therefore, a randomized double-blind controlled trial was performed on 70 subjects who were randomly enrolled in two groups and received either rose oil softgel or omeprazole capsule combined with the placebo. Data were collected within 3 sessions of visit using the Mayo-gastroesophageal reflux questionnaire (GERQ).", "Although, our findings showed that reflux symptoms were decreased in both groups after receiving medicine and the decrement was significant in treatment group, before and after the intervention, this decrease was not significant between two groups.", "Given that the rose oil used in this study was produced according to the Iranian method and effective ingredients of Rosa damascena were preserved in sesame oil in production process, it seems that effectiveness of this product can be due to its tonic and enlivening properties. Consumption of rose oil soft capsule alleviates cardinal GERD symptoms similar to omeprazole. It seems that rose oil can have the same effects as PPIs in treatment of GERD but with no side effects due to its different mechanisms of action."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
