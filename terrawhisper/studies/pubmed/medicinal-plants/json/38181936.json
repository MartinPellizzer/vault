Outcomes included the primary outcome (TPOAb), secondary outcomes (TSH, TGAb, FT3, FT4, and traditional Chinese medicine symptom scores), and adverse events. This study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022363640).", "Sixteen trials were reviewed and 16 HM formulae were compared. Compared with non-drug therapy (NDT), all therapies, except for Tiaoqi-Qingjie Therapy, reduced the primary outcome of TPOAb with different levels of effectiveness, ranging from 0.01 (95%CI 0.00, 0.02) to 0.92 (95%CI 0.56, 1.53). Ranking probability analysis indicated that Yiqi Huayu Recipe, Liqi Xiaoying decoction, and Shugan Sanjie therapy reduced thyroid antibody levels the most, including TPOAb (100.0%, 90.9%, and 90.3%, respectively) and TGAb (98.3%, 94.4%, and 87.3%, respectively). All HMs displayed a significant effect on the TCM Symptom score and possibly benefitted the treatment of HT, ranging from 6.62 (95% CI 2.06, 21.24) to 94.50 (95% CI 15.97, 559.14).
