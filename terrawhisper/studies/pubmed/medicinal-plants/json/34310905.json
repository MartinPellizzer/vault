Aromatic herbs and medicinal plants found in Algeria and their anti-angiogenesis and cytotoxic potentials against cancer have not been much explored.", "Our work aimed to evaluate the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties of the essential oil (EO) extracted from rose-scented geranium (Pelargonium graveolens) and its major (citronellol) and characteristic (linalool) constituents.", "The chemical composition of EO was determined with chromatographic analysis and revealed the presence of citronellol as the major compound (25.84%). A strong chelating power of terpene alcohols (IC50=1.58\u00b10.23mg/mL for citronellol) was found, with a significant difference (P<0.05) compared with the standard antioxidants used (L-ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxyanisole). The EO is distinguished by an interesting anti-inflammatory effect with the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> (4.63\u00b10.3mg/mL), and it constitutes a good stabilizer of the erythrocyte membrane. Citronellol also exhibited the best anti-inflammatory effect (IC50=0.74\u00b10.09mg/mL). We also assessed the anticancer effect of EO on two main pathways involved in cancer development, angiogenesis and cell proliferation, using in ovo bioassays with a chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) of chicken eggs and in vitro assays of its cytotoxicity on different metastatic breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), gastric (AGS) and melanoma (MV3) cell lines. In the CAM model, the density of micro-vessels is 75\u00b110\u00a0in the group supplemented with EO compared to 140\u00b19\u00a0for the control group (b-FGF). In addition, the EO significantly reduced the number of newly formed vessels. The cytotoxicity was evaluated using the cell proliferation inhibition method and cell viability was measured using the MTT test. Results revealed that the treatment of cancer lines with different concentrations of EO reduces the rate of cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. EO showed the greatest cytotoxicity on the AGS line with an inhibition rate of 92.87\u00b10.13% at the highest dose (4\u03bcL/mL), followed by the MV3\u00a0line (88.76\u00b10.96%).", "Data demonstrated that rose-scented geranium EO has an antitumor potential on metastatic cancer cell lines. It is distinguished by its antiproliferative, anti-angiogenic, and anti-inflammatory activities. Medicinal plants might contain new molecules, with new structures, which could become lead candidate among future anticancer drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de Pharmacie.
