Britt is a renowned medicinal plant with pharmaceutically valuable phenolic acids and flavonoids. The present study was aimed to study the eliciting effect of silver and copper nanoparticles (AgNPs and CuNPs, 50 and 100\u00a0mg/L), and methyl jasmonate (MeJa, 50 and 100\u00a0\u03bcM) on the biochemical traits, the accumulation of phenolic compounds and antioxidative capacity of P. frutescens cell suspension culture. Suspension cells were obtained from friable calli derived from nodal explants in Murashige and Skoog (MS) liquid medium containing 1\u00a0mg/L 2,4-D and 1\u00a0mg/L BAP. The 21 days old cell suspension culture established from nodal explant derived callus supplemented with 100\u00a0mg/L MeJa resulted in the highest activity of catalase and guaiacol peroxidase enzymes, and CuNPs 100\u00a0mg/L treated cells indicated the maximum content of total phenol, total anthocyanin, superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Also, the highest content of ferulic acid (1.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03, mg/g DW), rosmarinic acid (19.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12, mg/g DW), and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (16.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18, U/mg protein) were observed with 100\u00a0mg/L CuNPs, exhibiting a total increase of 1.58-fold, 2.12-fold, and 1.51-fold, respectively, higher than untreated cells. On the other hand, AgNPs 100\u00a0mg/L treated cells indicated the most amounts of caffeic acid (0.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03, mg/g DW) and rutin (1.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07, mg/g DW), as well as the highest scavenging potential of free radicals. Overall, the results of the present study can be applied for the large-scale production of valuable phenolic acids and flavonoids from P. frutescens through CuNPs and AgNPs 100\u00a0mg/L elicited cell suspension cultures."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
