XSC was given orally to the rat before oleic acid administration. The effect of XSC on the model was observed by determination of PaO2, wet/dry ratio of lung and pathologic examination at 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours separately.", "The respiratory frequency of model animal increased markedly, with the water content of lung reduced and aggravated as the hypoxia prolonged. XSC could obviously improve the pulmonary edema and inflammatory cell infiltration in lung.", "The aforesaid acute lung injury model with successful rate of 100%, it resembles the clinical acute lung injury and was useful for research on pathophysiology and treatment of ARDS or acute lung injury, XSC could improve the oleic acid induced lung injury in hypoxia rats by reducing the pulmonary edema and inflammatory cell infiltration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "9211576", "ISSNLinking": "1003-5370"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2UMI9U37CP", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7S5I7G3JQL", "NameOfSubstance": "Dexamethasone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I9ZF7L6G2L", "NameOfSubstance": "Nifedipine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dexamethasone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoxia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Nifedipine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11477821"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
