Nutritional assessment of all the Lobia-containing diets (without or with supplementation) was made by chemical analysis as well as through rat assay. Lobia contained 20.43% of protein. Cooking resulted in minor changes in nutrients. It had 0.54% lysine which was reduced to 0.29% on cooking. All other amino acids also showed losses during cooking. Protein efficiency ratio (PER) of diets containing raw Lobia was 1.05 and significantly (P < 0.05) improved to 1.47 on cooking. True digestibility (TD) and net protein utilization (NPU) also showed a significant (P < 0.05) improvement in the case of cooked Lobia. Supplementation of Lobia with 20% of mutton or beef meat improved the PER significantly (P < 0.05) over unsupplemented diet containing cooked Lobia only. TD was improved from 74.9% in cooked to 84.3% in diets containing 20% mutton. Similarly NPU improved as a result of meat supplementation, from 40.7% in cooked to 53.4%. Higher PER, TD and NPU values were observed in diets containing Lobia supplemented with 20% level of mutton or beef."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Rural Home Economics, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhatty", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gilani", "ForeName": "A H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nagra", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "9432922", "ISSNLinking": "0963-7486"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Meat Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Poultry Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11570019"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
