They were randomly assigned to two SH treatments, either 4 to 8 cm or 8 to 11 cm, and fed three levels of supplement, high, low, or none, consisting of 6.24, 3.12, and 0 kg x animal(-1) x d(-1), respectively. The experiment was repeated over three 15-d periods in 1996: May (P1), June/July (P2), and August (P3). No SH x supplement level x period or SH x supplement level interactions (P > 0.10) were evident for responses tested. Cows on lower SH had greater (P < 0.08) DMI but spent an additional 1.3 h/d (P < 0.01) grazing compared with cows on higher SH. Sward height had no influence (P > 0.10) on forage DM digestibility (DMD). Forage DMI, DMD, and grazing time (GT) decreased (P < 0.05) as supplementation increased. Nonetheless, supplemented cows consumed more total DMI (P < 0.08) than unsupplemented cows. Cows consumed 2.4 kg/d more forage DM (P < 0.01) in P1 and P2 than in P3. Cows grazed 1.3 h/d (P < 0.01) less in P1 than in P2 and P3. Grazing efficiency (DMI/h GT) declined as supplementation increased and grazing season advanced to P3 (P < 0.01). Decreased forage DMI and grazing efficiency with increasing supplementation suggests that supplemented cattle should be able to maintain productivity while grazing at SH lower than unsupplemented cattle."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Animal and Veterinary Sciences, West Virginia University, Morgantown 26506-6108, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gekara", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prigge", "ForeName": "E C", "Initials": "EC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bryan", "ForeName": "W B", "Initials": "WB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schettini", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nestor", "ForeName": "E L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Townsend", "ForeName": "E C", "Initials": "EC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Anim Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8003002", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8812"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Intake"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Feeding Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lactation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11263836", "10.2527/2001.793745x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
