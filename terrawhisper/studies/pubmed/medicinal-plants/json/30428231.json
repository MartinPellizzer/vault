However, the high concentration required to achieve an antimicrobial effect in foods might be incompatible with their sensory acceptance. To avoid this problem, combinations of EOs provide an effective approach reducing the odds of sensory rejection. In our study, 13 EOs of herbs and spices commonly used in the seasoning of meat products were assessed for their antimicrobial activity against Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. However, only 7 of them were selected to study their synergistic effect based on their antimicrobial activity and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against foodborne pathogens. EOs of thyme and cinnamon presented the largest antibacterial activity against foodborne pathogens. Combinations of selected EOs displayed a synergic effect against foodborne pathogens and also an important decrease in their individual MIC. Thyme EO presented the lowest individual MIC, but its utilization in combination decreased the MIC of the other EOs. Utilization of cinnamon EO also improved the reduction of the individual MICs of the EOs of cumin and parsley. Our results suggest the potential use of EO mixtures to control foodborne pathogens in meat products. Although the individual MIC values of selected EOs decreased, the sensory impact on meat products needs to be assessed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda-D\u00edez", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alheiro", "ForeName": "Joana", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pinto", "ForeName": "Ana Luisa", "Initials": "AL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Falco", "ForeName": "Virgilio", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fraqueza", "ForeName": "Maria Jo\u00e3o", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Patarata", "ForeName": "Luis", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Commun", "NlmUniqueID": "101477873", "ISSNLinking": "1555-9475"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Meat Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spices"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30428231"]}}]}
