It was introduced to China in the Han Dynasty and was first described as a traditional Chinese medicine in Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians(Ming Yi Bie Lu). In this paper, by combing ancient and modern Chinese and foreign herbal medicine books and modern literature, combined with the results of field investigations on the origin of Styrax, the changes of Styrax involving the name, quality evaluation, origin, place of origin, and harvesting and processing were systematically verified. The results show that since ancient times, the origin and place of origin of Styrax have been unclear. The medical scientists of all dynasties in China have evaluated the quality of Styrax from four aspects: texture, viscosity, odor concentration, and color. The varieties of Styrax changed twice. The first change may have occurred during the Sui and Tang Dynasties, and the base changed from Styrax officinalis to Liquidambar orientalis. The second change was in modern times, and the base changed from L. orientalis to L. styraciflua. At the same time, the place of origin changed for the first time, from Turkey, Syria, and other countries in southern Asia Minor to Honduras, Guatemala, and other countries in Central America and southern North America. This paper studied the historical evolution of Styrax in terms of quality evaluation, origin, place of origin, character, and harvesting and processing. At the same time, it summarized the application of Styrax in the western countries, which can provide a historical basis for the further development and utilization of Styrax."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China Institute of Ben Cao Gang Mu, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China National Institutes for Food and Drug Control Beijing 102629, China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Yi-Ming", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine of Lingnan (Southern China) of Jinan University Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Meng-Hua", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Ben Cao Gang Mu, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Eric", "ForeName": "Brand", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Ben Cao Gang Mu, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institutes for Food and Drug Control Beijing 102629, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Xiao-Han", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China Institute of Ben Cao Gang Mu, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Sheng-Li", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China National Institutes for Food and Drug Control Beijing 102629, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Shuang-Cheng", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Medicine, Hong Kong Baptist University Hong Kong 00852, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Zhong-Zhen", "Initials": "ZZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Styrax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38621953", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20231208.101"]}}]}
