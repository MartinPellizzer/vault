However, the undesirable pharmacokinetic properties limit its application and development. Numerous researches on structural modifications of OA have been carried out to overcome this limitation and improve its pharmacokinetic and therapeutic properties. This review aims to compile and summarize the recent progresses in the medicinal chemistry of OA derivatives, especially on structure-activity relationship in the last few years (2010-2021). It gives insights into the rational design of bioactive derivatives from OA scaffold as promising therapeutic agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
