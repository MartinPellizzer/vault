The mountainous and strongly fragmented area, diversity of local flora, limited access to modern medicines because of the people's seminomadic lifestyle, and harsh climatic conditions have prompted the locals to benefit from natural resources, principally plants.", "Although the use of medicinal plant is common in the area, documentation and inventory analysis are not available on the plant taxa used in traditional medicine in A\u011fr\u0131 Province. This study focused on the answer of the following question: What are the most medicinally valuable plant taxa in the province? Therefore, this study aimed to (i) document medicinal plant taxa used in A\u011fr\u0131 Province; (ii) determine the endemic plant species and their risk categories; (iii) determine the most widely used\u00a0plant taxa for specific ailments to further contribute to drug discovery; (iv) determine the local names, plant part(s) used, preparation, and utilization methods of these local plant medicines to assist with pharmaceutical studies; and (v) reveal the origin(s) of traditional medicinal knowledge of A\u011fr\u0131 Province.", "Ethnopharmacological field studies were conducted between 2014 and 2016 in 638 locations within A\u011fr\u0131 Province. Plant samples used in folk medicine were determined through face-to-face interviews with 120 local healers. Traditional medicinal plant samples were collected from wild areas with the help of the local healers and transported to Van Pharmaceutical Herbarium (Van, Turkey) for botanical identification. The statistical analyses of data were conducted using the informant consensus factor (ICF) method.", "In this study, 118 medicinal taxa belonging to 35 families of plants were determined to be used in A\u011fr\u0131 Province. Ninety-three different local names were recorded, which mainly described the plant's morphological characteristics. Data analysis (ICF) revealed that the traditional medicinal plants used in A\u011fr\u0131 Province might offer promising information for new pharmaceuticals.", "The local population in the study area has a preserved and comprehensive knowledge of traditional medicine because of its limited access to modern medicine, seminomadic lifestyle, isolated geographical position, traditional taste habits, climatic conditions, diversity of local flora, and mountainous and rugged geography. The medicinal plants presented in this study might provide valuable leads for the identification of bioactive compounds for pharmaceutical use and represent a vast and underutilized resource for the development of newer and more efficient pharmacological treatments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
