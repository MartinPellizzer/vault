Treating this ailment is always a challenging job. Recently, oncogenic miRNA leading to apoptosis are highly promising targets of many natural products. In this study, Garmultin-A (GA), isolated from the bark of <i>Garcinia multiflora</i>, was elucidated for its anti-leukemic effect in CB3 cells.", "The effect of the compound on CB3 cell viability was detected by MTT assay and apoptosis by FITC Annexin V/PI and Hochest 33258 staining. The western blot analysis assessed the BAX, BCL2, cMYC, pERK, and PARP-1 protein levels. Autodock analysis predicted the ligand-protein interactions. q-RT-PCR quantified the miR-17-5p expression. Luciferase assay confirmed the interaction between PARP-1 and miR-17-5p.", "We uncover that GA leads to apoptosis by inducing overexpression of miR-17-5p and significantly downregulate PARP-1 protein levels in CB3 cells. The overexpression of miR-17-5p promotes apoptosis, and the miR-17-5p antagomirs restore GA-triggered apoptosis. Notably, we disclose that PARP-1 is a direct target of miR-17-5p. Increased pro-apoptotic and reduced anti-apoptosis protein levels were also observed in GA-treated CB3 cells.", "These results provide critical insights that GA could induce apoptosis in CB3 cells through targeting miR-17-5p by attenuating PARP-1. Thus, GA could act as a novel therapeutic agent for erythroleukemia."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["74628"], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants/School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, P.R.
