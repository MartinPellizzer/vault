Thell.), is considered to be a nitrate-accumulating leafy vegetable. Many studies show that light-emitting diode (LED) lights can be a suitable tool to decrease anti-nutritional compounds (e.g., nitrate (and enhance antioxidant and nutritional quality for phytochemical-rich vegetable production. The positive influence of humic acid on health-promoting compounds in different crops is also well documented. This study aimed to investigate the effects of supplemental LED lights of various spectral compositions, namely 25-100% red, 25-100% blue, and 100% white, as well as their combination with humic acid on the physiological and biochemical responses of rocket plants. ANOVA results showed that almost all the measured traits were significantly affected by LED and humic acid treatments. Generally, LED combined with humic acid improved the accumulation of nutritional compounds (e.g., polyphenols, flavonoid, ascorbic acid, carbohydrate, tannin), increased the activity of key enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism (e.g., nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, and glutamine synthetase), and lowered nitrate and ammonium concentrations. The results of principal component analysis indicated that the combination of LED lights, regardless of the spectra, with humic acid was the most effective treatment to enhance the nutritional value and activity of enzymes involved in nitrate assimilation. In sum, these findings may be used as a reference in rocket production for supplemental LED light optimization and its combination with humic acid."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.
