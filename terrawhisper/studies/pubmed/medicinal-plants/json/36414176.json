In this paper, two series of 28 novel Cajanonic acid A (CAA) derivatives were designed and synthesized. The biological activity showed that a novel CAA derivative 9f was identified as a potential PPAR \u03b3 antagonist by medicinal chemistry efforts. The results in vitro displayed that compound 9f could improve the PPAR \u03b3 antagonist activity (96.2\u00a0% / 50.2\u00a0% decrease in PPAR \u03b3 transactivation at 10\u00a0\u03bcM / 1\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively). It also could improve the glucose consumption activity of insulin-resistant HepG2/3T3-L1 cell line (33.27\u00a0% / 72.61\u00a0% increase in glucose consumption). And in 3\u00a0T3-L1 adipocytes, it showed anti-adipogenesis activity (7.04\u00a0% increase in oil red staining). Further, in vivo study suggested that compound 9f could improve the oral glucose tolerance in db/db mice. Taken together, derivative 9f served as a promising candidate for anti-diabetic drug discovery and deserve further study."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
