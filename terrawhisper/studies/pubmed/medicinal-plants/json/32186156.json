A herbal paste called CDR containing Honghua (Flos Carthami), Chuanxuduan (Radix Dipsaci Asperoidis) and Dahuang (Radix Et Rhizoma Rhei Palmati) was prepared. The rats were treated with either CDR topically on the fracture site, or SrR orally, or their combinations. Bone turnover biochemical markers in serum were measured. Microarchitecture of the fracture was analyzed using micro-CT after 14 and 28 d, followed by histomorphometrical analysis.", "Micro-computed tomography analysis revealed that the combined treatment of CDR with 600 mg/g SrR significantly increased the total callus density, mineralized callus volume fraction, mineralized callus mineral content and mineralized callus density of the callus after 28 d of treatment. This result was consistent with the histomorphometrical analysis on the osteoid volume. Analysis of biochemical markers showed that the combined treatments reduced the bone resorption that occurs temporarily after fracture.", "This study demonstrated that the combined treatment of oral SrR and topical CDR is effective to promote fracture healing by their additive effect on promoting bone formation and retarding bone resorption."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Research on Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong China."}], "LastName": "Siu", "ForeName": "Wing Sum", "Initials": "WS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Research on Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong China."}], "LastName": "Shiu", "ForeName": "Hoi Ting", "Initials": "HT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Research on Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong China."}], "LastName": "Shum", "ForeName": "Wai Ting", "Initials": "WT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Research on Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong China."}], "LastName": "Ko Chun", "ForeName": "Hay", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Research on Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong China."}], "LastName": "Lau", "ForeName": "Clara Bik San", "Initials": "CBS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong China."}], "LastName": "Hung Leung", "ForeName": "Kim", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Research on Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong China."}], "LastName": "Leung Ping", "ForeName": "Chung", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "J Tradit Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8211546", "ISSNLinking": "0255-2922"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bone Density Conservation Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Density Conservation Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fracture Healing"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fractures, Bone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Microtomography"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32186156", "2977"]}}]}
