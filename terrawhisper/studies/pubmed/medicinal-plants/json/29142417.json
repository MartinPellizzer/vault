However, the therapeutic effects of medicinal plants have not been fully examined scientifically. As cancer is a major health problem worldwide, searching for a new anticancer compound has attracted considerable attention. Our previous study found that 2',4'-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-3,5-dimethylchalcone, an active compound isolated from leaves of Indonesian medicinal plants <i>Eugenia aquea</i> Burm f. (Myrtaceae), had anticancer activity in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells through induction of apoptosis.", "To investigate the molecular mechanism of 2',4'-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-3,5-dimethylchalcone antiproliferative activity.", "Leaves of <i>E. aquea</i> were extracted by ethanol, fractionated by ethyl acetate, <i>n</i>-hexane, or water, and isolated for its active compound. Jurkat T-cells were treated with 2',4'-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-3,5-dimethylchalcone for 12 and 24 h, and a cell viability assay and real-time-reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for interleukin-2 (IL-2) mRNA measurement were performed. The effects of active compound to mitogen-activated protein kinases were also examined to investigate the mechanism of its antiproliferative activity.", "2',4'-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-3,5-dimethylchalcone inhibited Jurkat T-cell proliferation with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 59.5 mM. Although IL-2 mRNA expression was slightly increased after treatment, it inhibited c-Jun N-terminal kinase expression but not p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase expression.", "Our study indicated that the molecular mechanism mediating the antiproliferative activity of 2',4'-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-3,5-dimethylchalcone may be attributed to the stimulation of an immunological microenvironment in the cells.", "2',4'-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-3,5-dimethylchalcone was isolated from <i>Eugenia aquea</i>. The antiproliferative activity of 2',4'-dihydroxy-6- methoxy-3,5-dimethylchalcone significantly showed in Jurkat T-cells with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 59.5 mM through inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation. Interleukin-2 mRNA expression was also slightly increased after treatment with the compound, and this result may be indicated to the stimulation of the immunological microenvironment in T-cells. <b>Abbreviations used:</b><i>E. aquea</i>: <i>Eugenia aquea</i>, IL-2: Interleukin-2, MAPK: Mitogen-activated protein kinase, ERKs: Extracellular signal-regulated kinases, JNKs: c-Jun N-terminal kinases, p38: p38 MAPK, PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, IC<sub>50</sub>: Half maximal inhibitory concentration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Padjadjaran, Jatinangor 45363, Indonesia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Drug Discovery and Product Development, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Padjadjaran, Jatinangor 45363, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Barliana", "ForeName": "Melisa I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Padjadjaran, Jatinangor 45363, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Diantini", "ForeName": "Ajeng", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Padjadjaran, Jatinangor 45363, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Subarnas", "ForeName": "Anas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Drug Discovery and Product Development, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Padjadjaran, Jatinangor 45363, Indonesia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Padjadjaran, Jatinangor 45363, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Abdulah", "ForeName": "Rizky", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma University, Gunma Prefecture, Japan."}], "LastName": "Izumi", "ForeName": "Takashi", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacogn Mag", "NlmUniqueID": "101300403", "ISSNLinking": "0973-1296"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Abbas AK, Lichtman AH, Pillai S.
