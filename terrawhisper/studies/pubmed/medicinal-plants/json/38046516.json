This article studied the anti-inflammatory effects of lauric acid (LA), thiocolchicoside (TC) and thiocolchicoside-lauric acid (TC-LA) formulation. The anti-inflammatory effects of these compounds were determined by following the methods of inhibition of protein denaturation and proteinase inhibition activity. This was assessed at different concentrations to determine the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of the compounds. The result indicated that the activity of LA, TC, TC-LA formulation, and reference drug increased with the increase in the concentration from 10-50 \u00b5g/ml, thus proving the activity of LA, TC, and TC-LA formulation against inflammation was in a dose-dependent manner. The percentage of inhibition of protein denaturation was 59.56%, 66.94%, 86.62%, and 60.34% for LA, TC, the combination of TC-LA and standard drug, and the IC50 values were found to be 44.78 \u00b5g/mL, 37.65 \u00b5g/mL, 27.15 \u00b5g/mL and 43.42 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. The percentage of proteinase inhibition activity of LA, TC, and a combination of TC-LA and the standard drug was 66.65%, 77.49%, 94.07%, and 69.83%, and IC50 of LA, TC, a combination of TC-LA and standard drug were35.5 \u00b5g/mL, 32.12 \u00b5g/mL, 24.35 \u00b5g/mL and 37.80 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. We found out that lauric acid, thiocolchicoside, and thiocolchicoside-lauric acid formulation exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 Biomedical Informatics."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology, Saveetha Dental College and Hospitals, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Saveetha University, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology, Azeezia College of Dental Sciences and Research, Meyyannoor, Kollam , Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Mustafa", "ForeName": "Ameena", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Dentistry, Saveetha Dental College and Hospitals, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Saveetha University, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India."}], "LastName": "Arumugham Indiran", "ForeName": "Meignana", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanobiomedicine Lab, Department of Pharmacology, Saveetha Dental College and Hospitals, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Saveetha University, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India."}], "LastName": "Shanmugham", "ForeName": "Rajeshkumar", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology, Saveetha Dental College and Hospitals, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Saveetha University, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India."}], "LastName": "Ramalingam", "ForeName": "Karthikeyan", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Bioinformation", "NlmUniqueID": "101258255", "ISSNLinking": "0973-2063"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Mizushima Y.
