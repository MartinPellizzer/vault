Eventually we will run out of space, resources, or anything else that is also finite. Once this fact is recognized, it becomes clear that we must develop in a sustainable way so that we can endure into the future. Overpopulation, vegetation destruction, and pollution are all serious threats to our finite environment. Traditionally, change has been to expensive and politically destabilizing. However, extensive changes in our modes of living must be made so that they become sustainable. In both developed and developing countries, consumptive growth must be replaced with sustainable development. Many developing countries are currently selling their natural resources to the developed countries. When they run out of resources, they will be truly poor. All governments must recognize the value of forests. It is estimated that in terms of medical uses for forest products alone, they will be worth US$11-12 billion (1990 dollars) by 2050. This constitutes a large portion of developing countries economies. Also, 80% of the population of developing countries rely on natural, traditional medicines made from forest products. Even in the US 25% of prescription drugs are based on phytochemicals. Now the drug companies are actively pursuing these resources for their products. It is estimated that 95% of the world species have not been assayed for their chemical value. Technology and money are not the obstacles to sustainable development and forest conservation. It is will and attitude that must be radically changed in order to protect the forests for the ecological and economic value."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["073151", "00214135"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: LANCET."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Beliefs", "Capitalism", "Climate", "Culture", "Deforestation", "Developing Countries", "Drugs", "Economic Development", "Economic Factors", "Environment", "Environmental Degradation", "Global Warming", "Natural Resources", "Organization And Administration", "Planning", "Policy Development--changes", "Political Factors", "Political Systems", "Power", "Treatment"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "1349998", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1992", "Month": "06", "Day": "18"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "06", "Day": "10"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0140-6736", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "339", "Issue": "8805", "PubDate": {"Year": "1992", "Month": "May", "Day": "30"}}, "Title": "Lancet (London, England)", "ISOAbbreviation": "Lancet"}, "ArticleTitle": "What are the forests worth?", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "1330", "EndPage": "1333", "MedlinePgn": "1330-3"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Royal Botanic Gardens, Surrey, UK."}], "LastName": "Fellows", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Congress"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Lancet", "NlmUniqueID": "2985213R", "ISSNLinking": "0140-6736"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fossil Fuels"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Economics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Fossil Fuels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Global Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Growth"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1349998", "10.1016/0140-6736(92)91967-d", "0140-6736(92)91967-D"]}}]}
