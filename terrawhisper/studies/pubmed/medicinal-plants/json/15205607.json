We report here that BA may also have an effect on HL-60 cell differentiation. BA was cytotoxic to HL-60 cells with an IC50 of 5.7 microM after a 72-h treatment. Flow cytometry analysis showed that after exposure to 1-12 microM of BA for 72 h, approximately 10% of viable cells were in the sub-G1, presumably apoptotic, phase. At the same time differentiation was induced in approximately 10% (at 1 microM BA) to a maximum of 20% (at 6 microM BA) of cells as judged by the NBT-reduction test, and the expression of membrane markers CD11b and CD14. On the other hand, at 1 and 5 nM, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (DHD3) induced differentiation in approximately 10 and 70% of cells, respectively. At 1 nM DHD3, the addition of 1 microM BA increased differentiated cells from 10 to 43% and with 3 microM BA the increase was to 80%. BA also enhanced the effects of DHD3 in the expansion of the G1 cell population with a concomitant decrease of S phase cells. The effects of DHD3 and BA on CD11b and CD14 expression were inhibited by PD98059, a MEK inhibitor. Our results suggest that BA may enhance the effect of DHD3 in inducing mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase-mediated HL-60 cell differentiation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioactive Products Research Group, Department of Biology and Chemistry, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Poon", "ForeName": "Ka-Hung", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jinxia", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Cheng", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tse", "ForeName": "Anfernee Kai-Wing", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Chi-Keung", "Initials": "CK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fong", "ForeName": "Wang-Fun", "Initials": "WF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Drugs", "NlmUniqueID": "9100823", "ISSNLinking": "0959-4973"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CD11b Antigen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharide Receptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentacyclic Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.12.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FXC9231JVH", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcitriol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SJE1IO5E3I", "NameOfSubstance": "2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4G6A18707N", "NameOfSubstance": "Betulinic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "CD11b Antigen"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcitriol"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "G1 Phase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "HL-60 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharide Receptors"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Monocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pentacyclic Triterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Betulinic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15205607", "10.1097/01.cad.0000132237.15427.23", "00001813-200407000-00013"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
