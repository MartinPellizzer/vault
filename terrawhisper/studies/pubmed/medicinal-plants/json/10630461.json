Four adolescents who used St. John's Wort while under psychiatric care are described. Three of the patients had been reluctant to reveal this to their psychiatrist, believing the doctor had no interest in alternative medicine or would disapprove. Patient beliefs that prescribed medication has limitations and that natural products are safe contributed to the use of herbal remedies. The cases raise a number of issues, including the need for clinicians to routinely ask patients about alternative medicine use, to learn more about these treatments, and to discuss these approaches objectively with patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychological Medicine, University of Sydney, Australia. gwalter@mail.usyd.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walter", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rey", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9105358", "ISSNLinking": "1044-5463"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Mental Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10630461", "10.1089/cap.1999.9.307"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
