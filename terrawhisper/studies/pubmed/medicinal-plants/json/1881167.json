The recorded medical literature which now remains dates only after 10th century. In the history of Vietnamese national medicine, two names in particular stand out before 18th century. The first one is Tue Tinh of the 17th century, author of two treatises: Nam Duoc Than Hieu (The Miraculous Efficacy of Vietnamese Medicines) describing 580 indigenous drugs in 3873 prescriptions for 10 clinical specialities and Hong Nghia Giac Tu Thu. (Medical book from village Hong Nghia) summarizing the indications of 630 drugs with a theoretical part of traditional medicine. The second name would be Le Huu Trac (1720-1791) writing as Hai Thuong Lan Ong, author of the great treatise of traditional medicine with more than 30 volumes. From generation to generation by oral tradition and through literature, people have collected a lot of medicinal plants and especially a lot of medicinal prescriptions based on a long empirical knowledge of medicinal and toxic plants. After the August Revolution (1945), traditional medicine in our country was rehabilitated to its state position. Prof. Dr. D\u00f4 T\u00e2t Loi, one of the authors of this paper, was busy over 40 years compiling the medicinal plants, animal and mineral origins into a book (more than 1200 pages): Medicinal Plants and Drugs from Vietnam. A general part, the theoretical bases of eastern medicine, basic principles of drug identification, processing and preparation, study of drug efficaciousness and particular guides for using traditional drugs are presented. In the second part, the author introduces more than 700 drugs common in Vietnam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Loi", "ForeName": "D T", "Initials": "DT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Du\u00f1g", "ForeName": "N X", "Initials": "NX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Philosophy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Religion and Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vietnam"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1881167", "10.1016/0378-8741(91)90103-k", "0378-8741(91)90103-K"]}}]}
