Garlic supplementation to this diet suppressed these effects but their levels were still higher as compared to control rabbits. The plasma fibrinolytic activity which was decreased on cholesterol feeding was considerably increased when this diet was supplemented with garlic. There was increase in the activity of phospholipase in the cell-free supernatant of aorta and liver and decrease in the activity of cell-free supernatant NADH dehydrogenase of aorta when atherogenic diet was supplemented with garlic. Histopathological studies of aorta, liver and heart supported biochemical studies and indicated retardative effect of garlic on the development of atherosclerosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, India."}], "LastName": "Mirhadi", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "P P", "Initials": "PP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, Dietary"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Arteriosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1869301"]}}]}
