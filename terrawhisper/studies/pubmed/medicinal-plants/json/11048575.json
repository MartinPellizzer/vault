In PAGE the concentration of acrylamide used in the upper gel was 4.0% with a pH of 6.7 and in the lower gel 7.5% and 10% of acrylamide were used with a pH of 8.9. In PAGE-SDS the concentration of acrylamide was 4.4% with a pH of 6.8 in the upper gel and 7.5% and 12.6% with a pH of 8.8 in the lower gel. The material used were the Venezuelan genotypes Tovar, Yaracuy, Original and U-02. The albumins and globulins were extracted with a 0.5 M NaCl solution and then separated by dialysis against water and lyophilized. These protein fractions represented 84.85% of the total amount of protein in seeds. The albumins were separated in PAGE with 7.5% acrylamide into five fractions and globulins into six, with similar electrophoretic patterns between genotypes. In a similar manner, the patterns obtained in PAGE with 10% acrylamide were the same for all genotypes, showing five bands for albumins and three bands for globulins. With PAGE-SDS containing 7.5% of acrylamide, albumins were separated into as many as eight components, and globulins into as many as seven bands with mobilities between 0.2981 and 0.9932, with different patterns for each genotype. Also the patterns PAGE-SDS at 12.6% of acrylamide were different for the genotypes, separating proteins into a greater number of bands. The albumins showed as many as twenty-one bands with mobilities between 0.2603 and 0.7398, and globulins as many as sixteen bands with mobilities between 0.2454 and 0.7390. The PAGE patterns of the genotypes analyzed did not show differences between them. However, with PAGE-SDS different electrophoretic patterns were obtained which varied in the number and intensity of the bands, making it possible to distinguish the genotypes studied. The molecular weight of the albumins varied between 76,000 and 12,000 daltons and of the globulins between 80,000 and 12,000 daltons."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Facultad de Agronom\u00eda, Universidad Central de Venezuela."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ortiz de Bertorelli", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ram\u00edrez", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Estudio electrofor\u00e9tico de las alb\u00faminas y globulinas de cuatro genotipos de Canavalia ensiformis."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Albumins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Globulins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Albumins"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Globulins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11048575"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
