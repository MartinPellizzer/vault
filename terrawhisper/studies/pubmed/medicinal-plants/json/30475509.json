DPPH, SO, NO, and ABTS radical scavenging activities and protective effects against H(2)(02) induced cytotoxicity, as well as cytotoxic activities against the Hep-2 cell line of various extracts from Sedum spurium Bieb. were investigated. Besides, the total phenol, flavonoid, and flavonol contents of the extracts were determined to clarify their biological and phytochemical properties. Chromatographic studies on the most active extract led to the isolation of the major compound, identified as 2-methyl-erythritol by (1)H and (13)C NMR techniques. The EtOAc extract is found to be the most active extract in all tests. However, major compound of EtOAc extract did not possess tested activities. The EtOAC extract of S. spurium could be effective to improve antihemolytic defences of erythrocytes, and radical scavenging potential of the antioxidant mechanism. The extracts should be investigated in detail for their cytotoxic activities because of their possible pro-oxidant effects at high concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "S\u00f6hreto\u011flu", "ForeName": "Didem", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gen\u00e7", "ForeName": "Yasin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Harput", "ForeName": "\u00dc Sebnem", "Initials": "\u00dcS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sabuncuo\u011flu", "ForeName": "Suna", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Soral", "ForeName": "Michal", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Renda", "ForeName": "G\u00fclin", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liptaj", "ForeName": "Tibor", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Commun", "NlmUniqueID": "101477873", "ISSNLinking": "1555-9475"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetrazolium Salts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EUY85H477I", "NameOfSubstance": "thiazolyl blue"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sedum"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Tetrazolium Salts"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Thiazoles"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30475509"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
