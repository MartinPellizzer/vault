Compounds 1 and 2 are discovered to be the first 13-norgermacrane type sesquiterpenoids in natural products. Compound 15 is a rare 5,6-seco-guaiane type sesquiterpene and its possible biogenic precursor is presumed to be compound 20. Subsequent structural modification for compound 28 led to 21 derivatives, among which 15 derivatives were new compounds. All compounds were tested for the inhibitory effects on three tumor cell lines, and 17 compounds were active with the IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 1.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39\u00a0\u03bcM to 12.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.68\u00a0\u03bcM. The structure-activity relationships implied that an \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated lactone group was an important active group for the cytotoxicity. Two most active compounds (19 and 29) with low toxicity on normal human liver cell line were selected for further mechanism study. Compound 29 could induce apoptosis on Colo320DM cells through influencing the key apoptotic related proteins, such as PARP, Cleaved PARP, cleaved Caspase-3, and pro-Caspase 3. In addition, compound 19 with the best cytotoxic activity on HEL cells also could induce the apoptosis in dose- and time-dependent manners. In summary, our investigation implied that compounds 19 and 29 are two new potential anti-cancer candidates for ongoing study in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
