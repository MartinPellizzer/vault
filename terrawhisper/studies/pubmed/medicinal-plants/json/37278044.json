Since the use of pentavalent antimonial compounds such as meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime, MA) for the treatment of CL has side effects, naloxone as a new treatment in the footpad of Leishmania major (L. major)-infected BALB/c mice was investigated by evaluating the lesion size and the parasite burden.", "The animals were infected with L. major (MRHO/IR/75/ER). 40 BALB/c mice were divided into 4 groups (10/group), and were treated as follows 39 days after L. major infection: Group 1 treated with intraperitoneal injections of MA (100 mg/kg, positive control group) daily for six weeks; Group 2 received a 100 \u03bcl injection of PBS (negative control group); Group 3 received subcutaneous (SC) injections of naloxone (10 mg/kg) daily for six weeks (Naloxone1), and Group 4 was SC injected with naloxone (10 mg/kg) weekly for six weeks (Naloxone2). The lesion size was measured using a digital caliper.", "After the end of treatment, the lesion parasite burden was evaluated. As compared to the negative control group, the groups that received MA and naloxone (groups 1, 3, and 4) showed fewer parasites. Also, the naloxone-treated mice showed significantly smaller lesion sizes than the negative control group (p\u02c20.05), but they did not differ significantly from the MA-treated mice.", "Taken together, the results suggest that naloxone might be a promising and alternative treatment for CL."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4804-6991"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine Zabol University of Medical Sciences, Zabol, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zabol Medicinal Plants Research Center, Zabol University of Medical Sciences, Zabol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Azizi", "ForeName": "Hakim", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine Zabol University of Medical Sciences, Zabol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahdavinik", "ForeName": "Elham", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9094-5424"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Parasitology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxoplasmosis Research Center, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hataminejad", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Research and Training in Skin Diseases and Leprosy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khamesipour", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine Zabol University of Medical Sciences, Zabol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Montazeri", "ForeName": "Sareh", "Initials": "S"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "IR.ZBMU.REC.1397.200", "Agency": "Zabol University of Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Infect Disord Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "101269158", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5265"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "75G4TW236W", "NameOfSubstance": "Meglumine Antimoniate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiprotozoal Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leishmania major"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Leishmaniasis, Cutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Meglumine Antimoniate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiprotozoal Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "40"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37278044", "10.2174/1871526523666230602113613", "IDDT-EPUB-132248"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
