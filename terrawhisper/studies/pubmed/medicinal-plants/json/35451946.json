We aimed to perform molecular identification and AFST of 213 clinical <i>Aspergillus</i> isolates belonging to sections <i>Flavi</i> and <i>Nigri</i>. Molecular identification of isolates was performed using sequencing of the \u03b2-tubulin gene and <i>in vitro</i> AFST was conducted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M38-A3 guidelines.<b>Results.</b> The most common isolates in sections <i>Flavi</i> and <i>Nigri</i> were <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> (110/113, 97.3\u200a%) and <i>Aspergillus tubingensis</i> (49/100, 49.0\u200a%), respectively. A total of 62/213 (29.1\u200a%) isolates belonging to cryptic species were identified; among them, <i>A. tubingensis</i> was the most prevalent (49/62, 79.0%). <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> and <i>A. niger</i> isolates that responded to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of itraconazole above the epidemiological cutoff values were the most frequently detected: 8/110 (7.3\u200a%) and 3/41 (7.3\u200a%), respectively. In section <i>Flavi</i>, <i>Aspergillus alliaceus</i> responded to amphotericin B at a high MIC (>16 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup>) and in section <i>Nigri</i>, one of the three <i>Aspergillus luchuensis/awamori</i> isolates responded to itraconazole at an MIC >16 \u00b5g ml<sup>-1</sup>. Interestingly, for all <i>Aspergillus welwitschiae</i> isolates, the MIC<sub>50</sub> and MIC<sub>90</sub> of itraconazole were both 16 \u00b5g ml<sup>-1</sup>.<b>Conclusion.</b> A considerable presence of <i>A. flavus</i> and <i>A. niger</i> isolates showing non-wild-type responses to azoles in clinical cases of aspergillosis indicates the importance of classifying clinical <i>Aspergillus</i> isolates at the species level and performing antifungal susceptibility testing on the isolates, which would ensure appropriate treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Mycology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Invasive Fungi Research Center, Communicable Diseases Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nargesi", "ForeName": "Sanaz", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jafarzadeh", "ForeName": "Jalal", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Parasitology and Mycology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad 9199-91766, Iran."}], "LastName": "Najafzadeh", "ForeName": "Mohammad Javad", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nouripour-Sisakht", "ForeName": "Sadegh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Mycology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Invasive Fungi Research Center, Communicable Diseases Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Haghani", "ForeName": "Iman", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Mycology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Invasive Fungi Research Center, Communicable Diseases Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abastabar", "ForeName": "Mahdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Mycology, Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of \u00c7ukurova, Adana, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ilkit", "ForeName": "Macit", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Mycology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Invasive Fungi Research Center, Communicable Diseases Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hedayati", "ForeName": "Mohammad Taghi", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Med Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0224131", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2615"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "304NUG5GF4", "NameOfSubstance": "Itraconazole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7XU7A7DROE", "NameOfSubstance": "Amphotericin B"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Amphotericin B"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus flavus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Itraconazole"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35451946", "10.1099/jmm.0.001480"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
