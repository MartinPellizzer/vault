The present research work was designed to study the efficacy of different sunflower seed hybrid varieties (i.e. FH622, FH620, FH615, FH613 and FH545) chemically primed with potassium nitrate as natural antioxidant and antimicrobial agent. Antioxidant potential was determined using DPPH test, reducing power, TPC and TFC. Antibacterial activity was determined against Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial species. After one week, the germination data including mean germination and percentage of final emergence was calculated. It was found that seed varieties FH620 and FH615 have higher values of mean germination as compared to FH545 while FH615 has higher percentage of final emergence as compared to FH620 and FH545. High phenolic and flavonoid contents were observed in FH620 and FH615 as compared to FH545 variety. It was also observed that seed variety FH615 when treated with KNO3 solution had significantly high germination as well as antioxidant parameters and antibacterial activity as compared to other varieties. Similarly FH615 showed high antibacterial activities against Gram positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria. This study showed that all selected sunflower hybrids have good antioxidant and antibacterial potentials that would further be used for different trials to cure different pathogen related diseases, and these are natural sources of antioxidants for commercial and therapeutic applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Den", "ForeName": "Nighat Zia Ud", "Initials": "NZU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Mustafa", "ForeName": "Ghulam", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Bukhari", "ForeName": "Shazia Anwer", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Anjum", "ForeName": "Fozia", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Qasim", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shahid", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Helianthus"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31680090"]}}]}
