We have evaluated the anti-ulcerogenic effect of the alkaloidal fraction from the whole plant of M. cordata on diclofenac sodium-induced gastrointestinal lesion in rats. Long Evan's rats were divided into five groups. The control group was kept undisturbed. The vehicle group received vehicle after a 48-h fast. The diclofenac group received diclofenac sodium suspension (80 mg kg(-1)) after a 48-h fast. The diclofenac-ranitidine group (anti-ulcer drug used as a standard) received 35 mg kg(-1) ranitidine hydrochloride suspension 1 h after diclofenac sodium administration, after a 48-h fast. The diclofenac-extract group received alkaloidal fraction (50 mg kg(-1)) 1 h after diclofenac administration, after a 48-h fast. The biochemical, morphological and histological changes were studied. The data showed that the pH values of the stomach and duodenum were increased significantly (P < 0.001) in the alkaloidal-administered group compared with the control group (3.09 +/- 0.0429 vs 2.07 +/- 0.0339 and 6.79 +/- 0.1162 vs 6.19 +/- 0.1273, respectively). There were significant changes (P < 0.001) detected in the morphological study. The ulcer index of the stomach (0.268 +/- 0.0346) and of the duodenum (0.050 +/- 0.0129) in the alkaloidal-administered group were significantly lower than the diclofenac-only administered group (0.691 +/- 0.0184 and 0.0933 +/- 0.0138, respectively). According to the grading of tissue damage in the histological study, there were less or no lesions on the gastrointestinal mucosa of the alkaloidal-administered group compared with the diclofenac-only group (0 vs 5, respectively). When the results of the alkaloid extract group where compared with the ranitidine hydrochloride group a similar or more potent effect was observed with the alkaloidal extract group. The results of this study revealed that the bioactive principles of M. cordata have anti-ulcerogenic effects. The results validate the traditional use of this plant for the treatment of gastric ulcer in Bangladesh."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Rajshahi, Bangladesh. lcc@swadesh.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mosaddik", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alam", "ForeName": "K M", "Initials": "KM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "144O8QL0L1", "NameOfSubstance": "Diclofenac"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Diclofenac"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Acidity Determination"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Long-Evans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11045898", "10.1211/0022357001774930"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
