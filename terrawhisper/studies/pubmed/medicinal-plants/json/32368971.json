Due to their repetitive nature, chronic respiratory infections represent a global problem which is often a result of improper treatment. If not treated adequately, these conditions may have serious consequences. On the other hand, mis - and overuse of antibiotics has reduced their efficiency and accelerated the development of resistant bacterial strains, which further complicates the treatment of infections. This literature review will focus on current knowledge regarding medicinal plants and mushrooms which have been traditionally used in the treatment of infections caused by chronic sinusitis and tonsillitis commonly linked to bacteria - Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The present literature overview might be considered as a starting point for the development of novel, natural antimicrobial products with potential practical use in the treatment of chronic tonsillitis and sinusitis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Physiology, Institute for Biological Research \"Sinisa Stankovic\" - National Institute of Republic of Serbia, University of Belgrade, Bulevar Despota Stefana 142, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Kosti\u0107", "ForeName": "Marina", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Physiology, Institute for Biological Research \"Sinisa Stankovic\" - National Institute of Republic of Serbia, University of Belgrade, Bulevar Despota Stefana 142, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Ivanov", "ForeName": "Marija", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ENT Clinic, Clinical Hospital Centre Zvezdara, Presevska 31, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Babi\u0107", "ForeName": "Sne\u017eana Sankovi\u0107", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Physiology, Institute for Biological Research \"Sinisa Stankovic\" - National Institute of Republic of Serbia, University of Belgrade, Bulevar Despota Stefana 142, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Petrovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Jovana", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Physiology, Institute for Biological Research \"Sinisa Stankovic\" - National Institute of Republic of Serbia, University of Belgrade, Bulevar Despota Stefana 142, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Sokovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Marina", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Physiology, Institute for Biological Research \"Sinisa Stankovic\" - National Institute of Republic of Serbia, University of Belgrade, Bulevar Despota Stefana 142, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "\u0106iri\u0107", "ForeName": "Ana", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "451-03-68/2020-14/200007", "Agency": "Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pharyngitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sinusitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Tonsillitis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32368971", "10.2174/0929867327666200505093143", "CMC-EPUB-106358"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
