The availability of AlP, especially in Asian countries it has become a desirable factor to commit suicide. The phosphine produced from ALP is a very reactive radical and a respiratory inhibitor that causes oxidative damage. There is no dedicated antidote or effective drug to manage AlP-induced lung toxicity. The present study aims to evaluate and compare the protective effects of curcumin and nanocurcumin on ALP\u2011induced subacute lung injury and determine the underlying mechanism.", "Rats were exposed to AlP (2\u2009mg/kg/day, orally)+curcumin or nanocurcumin (100\u2009mg/kg/day, orally) for 7 days. Then rats were anesthetized and lung tissues were collected. Oxidative stress biomarkers, genes expression of antioxidant enzymes, participated genes in the SIRT1/FOXO3 pathway, and lung histopathology were assessed by biochemical and ELISA methods, Real-Time PCR analysis, and H&E staining.", "Curcumin and nanocurcumin produced a remarkable improvement in AlP-induced lung damage through reduction of MDA, induction of antioxidant capacity (TAC, TTG) and antioxidant enzymes (CAT, GPx), modulation of histopathological changes, and up-regulation of genes expression of SIRT1, FOXO3, FOXO1 in lung tissue.", "Nanocurcumin had a significantly more protective effect than curcumin to prevent AlP-induced lung injury via inhibition of oxidative stress. Nanocurcumin could be considered a suitable therapeutic choice for AlP poisoning."], "CopyrightInformation": "Thieme.
