Total K concentration values were calculated from <sup>40</sup>K data. Mushrooms were grouped in six fruiting bodies size classes regarding to their developmental stage. The <sup>137</sup>Cs activity concentrations declined in A. muscaria as the fruiting bodies maturated. The contents of <sup>40</sup>K/K activity remained constant in caps at different developmental stage, while for stipes an increase was around twofold (<sup>40</sup>K from 925\u2009\u00b1\u200955 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup> dry biomass in the baby individuals and 1600\u2009\u00b1\u200963-1700\u2009\u00b1\u200953 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup> dry biomass in two oldest classes). A. muscaria is a weak accumulator of <sup>137</sup>Cs, while a steep drop in activity concentrations of this nuclide in the fruiting bodies as they maturate has not been reported earlier for mushrooms. Clearly, a fate of <sup>137</sup>Cs in A. muscaria is highly different from that of <sup>40</sup>K/K that is an essential element to fungi. In parallel, an observed increase in the content of <sup>40</sup>K/K in stipes of fruiting bodies with developmental state can be related to its 'hardening' and more fibrous nature with age and basic function to support the cap, but this has not been studied."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2547-2496"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology , University of Gda\u0144sk , Gda\u0144sk , Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Environmental and Computational Chemistry Group , School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Cartagena , Cartagena , Colombia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Institute of Medicinal Plants , Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences , Kunming , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Falandysz", "ForeName": "Jerzy", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Institute of Meteorology and Water Management - Maritime Branch , National Research Institute , Gdynia , Poland."}], "LastName": "Saniewski", "ForeName": "Micha\u0142", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Institute of Meteorology and Water Management - Maritime Branch , National Research Institute , Gdynia , Poland."}], "LastName": "Zalewska", "ForeName": "Tamara", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Institute of Medicinal Plants , Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences , Kunming , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Isotopes Environ Health Stud", "NlmUniqueID": "9602611", "ISSNLinking": "1025-6016"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cesium Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radioactive Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4T2E65IAR7", "NameOfSubstance": "Cesium-137"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amanita"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cesium Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruiting Bodies, Fungal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Radioactive Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31037972", "10.1080/10256016.2019.1609961"]}}]}
