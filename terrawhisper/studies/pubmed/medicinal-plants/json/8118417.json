Addition of excess substrate to a solution of the enzyme and excess NAD+ leads to a \"burst\" of NADH formation followed by a slow linear increase (monitored spectrophotometrically). Amount of NADH formed in the burst phase is pH-dependent and is equal to 3.6 moles per mole enzyme at pH 8.6 and above. Presuming four equivalent and independent sites per enzyme molecule (i.e. D2-symmetry), consistent values were obtained for the equilibrium constant of the oxidation-reduction step at different pH and most substrate concentrations. At lower pH (7.3) and high [NAD+]/[substrate] ratios, favouring the C2- symmetry conformation of the enzyme, the magnitude of the burst phase was negligibly small; practically no oxidation reduction reaction took place. Combining these with earlier results on the group transfer step, it is suggested that the oxidation-reduction and group transfer steps of the reaction catalysed by this enzyme require the D2 and C2 symmetry conformations of the enzyme, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India."}], "LastName": "Malhotra", "ForeName": "O P", "Initials": "OP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Srinivasan"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tikoo", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kayastha", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Mol Biol Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9306673", "ISSNLinking": "1039-9712"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0U46U6E8UK", "NameOfSubstance": "NAD"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142-10-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isomerism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NAD"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8118417"]}}]}
