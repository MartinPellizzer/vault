Cheng. Spiropachysine A is the primary active steroidal alkaloids (SAs) widely used to facilitate blood circulation and relieve pain and inflammation. Few previous studies have investigated the anti-cancer activity of Spiropachysine A to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and its molecular mechanism remains unknown.", "This study aims to investigate the anti-cancer activity of Spiropachysine A and the underlying mechanisms by inducing methuosis in vitro and in vivo.", "Here, the activity of Spiropachysine A against cancer was evaluated by the experiments with MHCC-97H cells and the xenografted mice model. The cell proliferation was examined using MTT assay, and cell morphological characteristics were observed by microscope cellular imaging. The effects of autophagy, paraptosis, and oncosis on cytoplasmic vacuolisation were detected using immunofluorescence staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and western blotting (WB). The cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were analysed by flow cytometry. Hematoxylin eosin (H & E) staining was used to observe the pathological changes of the tissues.", "The in vitro and in vivo results indicated that Spiropachysine A could inhibit HCC cells proliferation (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a02.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.21\u00a0\u03bcM against MHCC-97H cells) and tumor growth (TGI\u00a0=\u00a032.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23% at 25\u00a0mg/kg and 50.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.26% at 50\u00a0mg/kg). The morphological changes of the treated cells showed that cell proliferation inhibition caused by Spiropachysine A was associated with numerous cytoplasmic vacuolization. Mechanistically, Spiropachysine A-induced methuosis rather than autophagy or arapaptic because the autophagy flux was blocked, leading to the increased LC3-II/I value and an accumulation of selective autophagy substrate p62. And, there was no activation of the regulatory parapaptic MAPK pathway. Additionally, the TEM and Lucifer yellow (LY) accumulation data confirmed that Spiropachysine A significantly triggered methuosis instead of oncosis. Further, the study indicated that the anti-proliferative activity of Spiropachysine A was independent of PCD since no alterations in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest-related proteins were observed after Spiropachysine A treatment. Impressively, the increased expression of Rac1 was observed in Spiropachysine A-treated MHCC-97H cells and its xenograft tumours, confirming that Spiropachysine A inhibited cell proliferation and induced methuosis through Ras/Rac1 signal pathways.", "Spiropachysine A was collectively identified as a novel methuosis inducer that suppresses HCC in vitro and in vivo. The underlying mechanisms might be involved in the Ras/Rac1 pathway. Such data predict that Spiropachysine A is a promising candidate for developing novel chemotherapeutic agents as a methuosis inducer for cancer therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier GmbH.
