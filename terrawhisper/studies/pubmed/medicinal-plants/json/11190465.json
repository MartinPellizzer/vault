These recombinations could be conditioned by a high content of repeated DNA sequences and the IS elements in the rhizobial genome. A high recombination activity of rhizobia is manifested in the panmictic structure of their populations, which is associated with frequency-dependent selection favoring rare recombinants. This selection is realized through the competition of virulent strains for the nodule formation and can be controlled by the genes whose expression depends on population density (via the quorum sensing mechanism). A high degree of panmixia in rhizobial populations is associated with their ecotypic polymorphism, manifested as the coexistence of symbiotic and nonsymbiotic strains. This type of polymorphism is caused by individual selection during the periodic changes of ecological niches (soil-plant host) in the rhizobia life cycle. The rhizobia-plant interaction stimulates selection in bacterial populations, which results in the increased levels of their heterogeneity and panmixia. The combination of individual and frequency-dependent selection types resulted in the high rates of symbiosis evolution and polyphyletic origin of diverse rhizobial species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "All-Russia Research Institute for Agricultural Microbiology, Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, St. Petersburg, Pushkin-8, 196608 Russia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Provorov", "ForeName": "N A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vorob'ev", "ForeName": "N I", "Initials": "NI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"], "VernacularTitle": "Evoliutsionnaia genetika kluben'kovykh bakteri\u012d: molekuliarnye i populiatsionnye aspekty."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Genetika", "NlmUniqueID": "0047354", "ISSNLinking": "0016-6758"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Evolution"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Fixation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Recombination, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Symbiosis"}], "NumberOfReferences": "65"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11190465"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
