Risk of bias generally was high. Of those, three RCTs with 562 cancer patients (mainly breast cancer) who used <i>Aloe vera</i> to treat radiodermatitis were included in the meta-analysis. There was a significant level of heterogeneity between the studies (<i>I</i><sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200995.8). One RCT found positive effects of <i>Aloe vera</i> in reducing the severity of radiodermatitis (standardized mean difference [SMD]\u2009=\u20093.37), whereas another revealed an inverse effect (SMD\u2009=\u2009-4). <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> At present, there are no herbal compositions that are effective in treating radiodermatitis, with <i>Aloe vera</i> failing to show sufficient efficacy in the meta-analysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Traditional Medicine and Materia Medica Research Center, and School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Medicine, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Heydarirad", "ForeName": "Ghazaleh", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ahadi", "ForeName": "Bahareh", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Traditional Medicine and History of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Molavi Vardanjani", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine, Evang.
