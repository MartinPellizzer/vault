This infection consequently lead various congenital disabilities during pregnancy in patients. Spiramycin (Spi), a macrolide antibiotic, is typically recommended for <i>T. gondii</i> infection in pregnant women. We aimed to prepare the nanoemulsion of spiramycin (NE-Spi) and to evaluate the activity of this formulation in tachyzoites of <i>T. gondii</i>, RH strain.", "This study was conducted in 2019-2021 at the School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. NE-Spi was prepared by spontaneous emulsification. The effects of this nanoemulsion on the viability of cultured cells were measured using MTT assay. To estimate the effects of NE-Spi on tachyzoites of <i>T. gondii</i>, RH strain, different concentrations of NE-Spi, S-Spi (suspension of spiramycin), and NE (nanoemulsion without any spiramycin) were added to tachyzoites and then stored for 30, 60, 90, 120 min and 24 h in 250 \u00b5g/ml concentration at room temperature. Finally, Tachyzoites mortality rates were evaluated by trypan blue staining. Of note, flow cytometry was conducted to confirm the obtained results.", "The final particle size of NE-Spi was calculated to be 11.3 nm by DLS and TEM. Thereafter, using MTT assay, in 62.5 \u00b5g/ml concentration of NE-Spi, the Vero cells viability was obtained as 82%. The highest mortality rates of tachyzoites of <i>T.gondii</i>, RH strain were observed at 250 \u00b5g/ml concentration and after 120 min of exposure, but it was not significantly different from 24 h of exposure.", "NE-Spi has lethal efficacy on <i>T. gondii</i> RH strain in-vitro."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Hashemi-Hafshejai et al.
