Novel apigenin-donepezil derivatives, naringenin-donepezil derivatives, genistein-donepezil derivatives and chalcone-donepezil derivatives have been synthesized, in\u00a0vitro results showed that TM-4 was a reversible and potent huAChE (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.36\u00a0\u03bcM) and huBChE (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a015.3\u00a0\u03bcM) inhibitor, and showed potent antioxidant activity (ORAC\u00a0=\u00a01.2 eq). TM-4 could significantly inhibit self-induced A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> aggregation (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a03.7\u00a0\u03bcM). TM-4 was also an ideal neuroprotectant, potential metal chelation agent, and it could inhibit and disaggregate huAChE-induced and Cu<sup>2+</sup>-induced A\u03b2 aggregation. Moreover, TM-4 could activate UPS degradation pathway in HT22\u00a0cells and induce autophagy on U87\u00a0cells to clear abnormal proteins associated with AD. More importantly, TM-4 could cross BBB in\u00a0vitro assay. In addition, in\u00a0vivo assay revealed that TM-4 exhibited remarkable dyskinesia recovery rate and response efficiency on AlCl<sub>3</sub>-induced zebrafish AD model, and TM-4 indicated surprising protective effect on A\u03b2<sub>1-40</sub>-induced vascular injury. TM-4 presented precognitive effect on scopolamine-induced memory impairment. And the regulation of multi-targets for TM-4 were further conformed through transcriptome sequencing. More interesting, the blood, urine and feces metabolism in rat and rat/human liver microsome metabolism towards TM-4 were also investigated. Overall, TM-4 is a promising multi-function candidate for the development of drugs to Alzheimer's disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.
