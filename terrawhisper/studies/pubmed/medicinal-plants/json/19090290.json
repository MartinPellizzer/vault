Callus cultures were induced from leaf, stem and cotyledonary explants of Momordica charantia, at different auxin and cytokinin concentrations either in single or in combination in MS medium. The best callogenic response was observed from all three explants (leaf, stem and cotyledon) on MS medium supplemented with 1.0 and 1.5 mg L(-1) BAP with 1.5 mg L(-1) NAA and 1.0 mg L(-1) 2,4-D, respectively. The callus produced was hard, green and compact. These totipotent cells were failed to give rise shooting response when transferred to same or different growth regulator containing medium as second subculture. Indirect organogenesis response was very low or absent due to hardening of callus and habitutation. Best shooting was observed at 1.0 mg L(-1) BAP + 0.1 TDZ and 1.5 mg L(-1) BAP + 0.2 mg L(-1) NAA from shoot tip and cotyledonary node explants. While root formation was achieved when generated shoots were transferred to MS medium both full and half strength supplemented with different auxin concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Plant Cell and Tissue Culture Lab, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Malik", "ForeName": "Saima", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zia", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Riaz-ur-Rehman"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chaudhary", "ForeName": "M Fayyaz", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101247723", "ISSNLinking": "1028-8880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cucurbitaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokinins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Probability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regeneration"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19090290", "10.3923/pjbs.2007.4118.4122"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
