Besides, even after seed storage and sowing the uniform establishment of plants is essential for their success. Crotalaria ochroleuca and Crotalaria spectabilis are important medicinal plants with poor seed germination rate, occasionally. The effects of seed priming in both C. ochroleuca and C. spectabilis were evaluated in seed performance even after seeds storage for up 90-days. Experimental assays were performed in a randomized design with gibberellic acid (GA3, 100 ppm), polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000, -0.2 MPa) and PEG (-0.2 MPa) + GA3 (100 ppm) solutions during seed priming in four replicates. Seeds not submitted to priming treatments constituted control. Seeds physiological performance were evaluated immediately and even after 30, 60 and 90-days seed dry-storage. The data obtained in each experiment were submitted to variance analysis (ANOVA) adopting a confidence level of 95%. The effects of seed priming with PEG and GA3 during seed ageing were significant for germination variables of C. ochroleuca and C. spectabilis. During dry storage, seed viability of both species gradually decreased and the first symptoms were delayed seed germination, especially more evident for C. ochroleuca, even in primed or non-primed seeds. Afterwards, C. ochroleuca seeds previously GA3 primed had higher results of root protrusion (86%), hypocotyls elongation (76%) and complete seedlings (75%) than non-primed seeds (control). These findings shown a good potential of hormopriming to attenuate damage during the seed aging of C. ochroleuca."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8582-7282"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidade Federal da Grande Dourados - UFGD, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias Agr\u00e1rias, Dourados, MS, Brasil."}], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "B N P", "Initials": "BNP"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3203-6932"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidade Federal da Grande Dourados - UFGD, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias Agr\u00e1rias, Dourados, MS, Brasil."}], "LastName": "Masetto", "ForeName": "T E", "Initials": "TE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4824-6179"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidade Federal da Grande Dourados - UFGD, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias Agr\u00e1rias, Dourados, MS, Brasil."}], "LastName": "Rocha", "ForeName": "L G", "Initials": "LG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101129542", "ISSNLinking": "1519-6984"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crotalaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38536976", "10.1590/1519-6984.279806", "S1519-69842024000101117"]}}]}
