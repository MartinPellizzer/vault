Sixty-four subjects from the rural areas of Ibadan participated in a study to determine the contribution of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) foods to the total intake of nutrients in a mixed diet. The subjects were randomly selected from those who, according to their mothers, reacted to cowpea foods (reactors) and those who did not (non-reactors). 2. The results showed that for all subjects, protein, energy and riboflavin needs were not met from the total diet consumed. However, the requirements for vitamin A, thiamin and iron were met. 3. Between 30 months and 3 years of age, cowpeas contributed 36.2 and 30.3% of protein intake for nonreactors and reactors respectively. Corresponding values for energy intake were 17.3 and 17.2% respectively. Lower percentages were contributed by the diets of 4- to 6-year-olds. 4. Irrespective of the classification system used, some of the subjects were found to be suffering from mild to moderate malnutrition, with a few severe cases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Akinyele", "ForeName": "I O", "Initials": "IO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Akinlosotu", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0372547", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anthropometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Food Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritional Requirements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritional Status"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Socioeconomic Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3620436", "10.1079/bjn19870066", "S0007114587000680"]}}]}
