Due to its devastating symptoms, attempts to develop new drugs with mild side effects have resulted in a number of drugs that are functioning through various mechanisms. Among these, Glycogen phosphorylase (GP) inhibitors emerged as a new strategy for combating DM. GP is an enzyme that regulates blood glucose levels; it catalyses the breakdown of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate in the liver and tissues with high and fluctuating energy demands. In the present research, we evaluate the possibility of type 2 diabetes therapy with the help of chalcones which are known to have antidiabetic activities. For this purpose, 29 chalcones were modelled, synthesised and investigated for their inhibitory activity against GP using <i>in-vitro</i> methods. Compounds <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> were found to be the most potent compounds with IC<sub>50</sub> values 26.6, 57.1 and 75.6\u2009\u00b5M respectively. The observed results were further validated using <i>in-silico</i> methods. Molecular docking simulation revealed interaction patterns that explain the structure-activity relationships of the compounds with GP. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation demonstrated a stable complex formation between compound <b>1</b> and GP through lower value and uniformity in root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the complex and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of the protein C\u03b1."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Medicinal and Aromatic Plants and Traditional Medicine Research Institute, National Center for Research, Khartoum, Sudan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ibn Sina University, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Awad", "ForeName": "Talal Ahmed", "Initials": "TA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Medicinal and Aromatic Plants and Traditional Medicine Research Institute, National Center for Research, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Alfatih", "ForeName": "Fatima", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "H.E.J.
