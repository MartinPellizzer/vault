CIA model was based on mice. The effect of GCS in CIA mice was measured by paw-swelling, arthritis scores, and histopathological assessment of synovium. Indices of thymus and spleens were measured. Thymocytes and splenocytes proliferation, activity of interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-2 (IL-2) were assayed by MTT and [(3)H]TdR method. The level of anti-collagen type II (CII) antibody in serum and prostaglandin E (PGE) in ankle were assayed by ELISA and ultraviolet spectrophotometer method, respectively.", "The onset of paw-swelling was on d 24 after injection of emulsion. The peak of secondary inflammation appeared on d 36 and then declined after d 40. GCS and GTW significantly reduced paw-swelling and arthritis scores, reduced the increase of spleen indices of CIA mice, suppressed the ConA or LPS-induced thymocyte or spleen cell proliferation, and the production of IL-1 and IL-2 in CIA mice. GCS reduced the level of anti-CII antibody and PGE. Histological pathology analysis demonstrated that the synovium of CIA mice was hyperplastic, pannus was formed, and inflammatory cells infiltrated into synovium. The pathological changes were significantly reduced by GCS.", "GCS had anti-inflammatory effect on CIA mice, which might be related to the modification of the abnormal immunological function of CIA mice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ling-ling", "Initials": "LL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Shang-xue", "Initials": "SX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Xiang-yang", "Initials": "XY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Wu-yi", "Initials": "WY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phototherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rosales"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tripterygium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15525473"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
