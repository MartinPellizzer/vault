Neopestalotiopsis sp. SKE15 was isolated and identified according to phenotypical and genotypical analyses (GenBank Accession No. MG649986). The exopolysaccharide (EPS) was produced by cultivation of mycelia in broth culture and extracted. The production was optimized to 2.02\u202fg/l after selection of agitation, temperature, FeSO<sub>4</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> concentrations as the most influencing factors using Placket-Burman design and then by applying response surface methodology. Analytical Tools showed that the EPS is composed of a polysaccharide (1.5-2.1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>6</sup>\u202fDa) and its probable low molecular weight derivatives, in a wide range of chain lengths, among them an oligosaccharide of about 1970\u202fDa was dominant. GC-MS (Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) analysis revealed the EPS was mainly constructed from d-glucose, sorbitol and D-galactose. The EPS showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl) and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity assays showed strong antioxidant activity of the EPS. A challenge with three different cancerous cell lines showed cytotoxic activity of the EPS at final concentration of 100 and 200\u202f\u03bcg/ml. Further investigation on medicinal applications of the biopolymer is promising."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
