Seven of these molecules are previously undescribed, including three abietane-type (brachytylins A-C) and one labdane-type (brachytylin D) diterpenoids, an unseparated C-24 epimeric mixture of cycloartane-type triterpenoids (brachytylins E/F, ratio: 1:1), and a rare rearranged 12(1\u202f\u2192\u202f6)-abeo-megastigmane glycoside (brachytylins G). Their structures and absolute configurations were determined by extensive spectroscopic (e.g., detailed 2D NMR and ECD) methods and/or X-ray diffraction analyses. All the isolates were evaluated for their inhibitory activities against the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-citrate lyase (ACL) and the Src homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2). Among them, abiesadine J showed inhibitory effect against ACL, displaying an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 17\u202f\u03bcM. 3S,23R-Dihydroxycycloart-24-en-26-oic acid exhibited inhibitory effect on SHP2, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 19\u202f\u03bcM. Meanwhile, 3R*,23S*-dihydroxycycloart-24-en-26-oic acid was found to have inhibitory effects against both ACL and SHP2, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 16 and 12\u202f\u03bcM, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
