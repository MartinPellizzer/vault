The effects of the known antiemetic compound metoclopramide were compared with those of zingicomb, a combination preparation of extracts of Ginkgo biloba and Zingiber officinale, also presumed to have antiemetic properties. Place conditioning was performed using a conventional three-compartment test procedure. On three successive conditioning trials, rats received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of lithium chloride (125 mg/kg) and were placed into the compartment that they had preferred over three baseline trials. During the test, rats treated with lithium chloride (LiCl) spent less time in the treatment compartment, indicative of a conditioned place aversion (CPA). In the first experiment, metoclopramide (MCP) was administered intragastrically (IG) in doses of 2 or 10 mg/kg 60 min prior to LiCl injection. The pretreatment with 50 and 100 mg/kg zingicomb attenuated the LiCl-produced CPA, whereas a dosage of 10 mg/kg had no effect. These findings suggest that LiCl-induced CPA is a viable procedure with which to assess the antiemetic properties of metoclopramide. Furthermore, the data confirm the hypothesis that the phytopharmacon zingicomb might have antiemetic properties that are comparable to those of metoclopramide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Physiological Psychology I, Heinrich-Heine-University of D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany."}], "LastName": "Frisch", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hasen\u00f6hrl", "ForeName": "R U", "Initials": "RU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mattern", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "H\u00e4cker", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huston", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacol Biochem Behav", "NlmUniqueID": "0367050", "ISSNLinking": "0091-3057"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiemetics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G4962QA067", "NameOfSubstance": "Lithium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L4YEB44I46", "NameOfSubstance": "Metoclopramide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiemetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Avoidance Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lithium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Metoclopramide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8577797", "10.1016/0091-3057(95)00073-6", "0091-3057(95)00073-6"]}}]}
