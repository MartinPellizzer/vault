Different concentrations of 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde were added respectively and incubated for 3 hours, then stimulated for another 12 hours by IL-1. Activities of COX-1 and COX-2 in rCMEC, and production of PGE2 in the conditioned media were measured by ELISA.", "Positive immunostaining for VIII factor was present diffusely in the cytoplasm of > 90% rCMEC. After being exposed to 30 ng x mL(-1) IL, the activity of COX-2 in rCMEC and the production of PGE2 in conditioned media were higher than those of control group, while there was no difference on activity of COX-1 in the two groups. 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde could down-regulate them in concentration-dependently, and significant differences on the activity of COX-2 and amount of PGE2 were showed in 200 microg x mL(-1) concentration.", "2-methoxycinnamaldehyde can affect the PGE2 release in rCMEC induced by IL-1, which might be related with its inhibition on the activity of COX-2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jian-you", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yuan-xiao", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Bao-sheng", "Initials": "BS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hong-bin", "Initials": "HB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Lan-fang", "Initials": "LF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Yue-Ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Shu-ying", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huo", "ForeName": "Hai-ru", "Initials": "HR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Ting-liang", "Initials": "TL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4940G3R6HE", "NameOfSubstance": "2-methoxycinnamaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7864XYD3JJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Acrolein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K7Q1JQR04M", "NameOfSubstance": "Dinoprostone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "analogs & derivatives", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acrolein"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood supply"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 1"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dinoprostone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Microcirculation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17048610"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
