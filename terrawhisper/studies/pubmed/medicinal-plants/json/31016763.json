The aim of the current study was to investigate the probable hepatoprotective effects of hydroalcoholic extract of watercress (WC) against oxidative stress and liver injury in bile duct ligation (BDL)- induced cholestatic rats. A total of 32 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups; sham control (SC), BDL, SC\u2009+\u2009hydroalcoholic extract of WC and BDL\u2009+\u2009hydroalcoholic extract of WC. WC-treated rats received daily WC 500\u2009mg/kg/day for 10 days. Biochemical tests, hepatic oxidative stress markers, and antioxidant enzymes activity were estimated. Further, liver hydroxyproline content was assayed and histological analysis was made. The BDL model markedly elevated the protein carbonyl (PCO) and hydroxyproline contents and decreased the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. Hydroalcoholic extract of WC significantly decreased the surge in liver PCO and hydroxyproline levels and increased the reduced GPx enzyme activity contents in the hepatic tissue. As determined by hematoxylin and eosin staining, BDL considerably induced hepatocyte necrosis. Moreover, these changes were significantly attenuated by the hydroalcoholic extract of WC treatment. Our data indicate that the hydroalcoholic extract of WC extract attenuated liver damage in BDL rats by decreasing the hydroxyproline content and histopathological indexes. Also, it reduced oxidative stress by preventing the hepatic protein oxidation and enhancing the activity of the GPx enzyme via antioxidative effect and free-radical scavenging. Our findings suggest that hydroalcoholic extract of WC could be a beneficial new curative agent for cholestatic liver damage."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghi", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Azarmehr", "ForeName": "Nahid", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Razmkhah", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghi", "ForeName": "Heibatollah", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Danaei", "ForeName": "Nazanin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Clinical Education Research Center, Zeinabieh Hospital, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Omidifar", "ForeName": "Navid", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vakilpour", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Afzalipour School of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Pourghadamyari", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Doustimotlagh", "ForeName": "Amir Hossein", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "8205768", "ISSNLinking": "0730-2312"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RMB44WO89X", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyproline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bile Ducts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cholestasis, Intrahepatic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyproline"}, {"QualifierName": ["injuries"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nasturtium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Necrosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Carbonylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31016763", "10.1002/jcb.28749"]}}]}
