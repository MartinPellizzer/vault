In order to explore the safety of the soil in the areas where <i>Forsythia suspensa</i> grows,70 surface (0-25 cm) soil samples were collected from the main growing areas of <i>F. suspensa</i> in the eastsouth of Shanxi Province in July 2017. The concentration and composition characteristics of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the sample soils were analyzed using chemical extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The diagnostic ratio method was used to determine the source of PAHs in the areas. The potential ecological risk was assessed by using the method of calculating the equivalent carcinogenic concentration of benzo[a]pyrene. The results showed that the average concentration of total PAHs (\u03a316PAHs) in all of the soil samples was 1.85 \u03bcg\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>, which was dominated by three ring number PAHs, accounting for 76.7% of the total PAHs. The detection rates of phenanthrene (Phe) and anthracene (Ant) were both 100% of all the sample sites. The soil PAHs in the wild <i>F. suspensa</i> growing areas mainly originated from coal, biomass burning, and motor vehicle exhaust emissions, which resulted from air transport and sedimentation pathways. In all of the sample sites, the concentration of \u03a316PAHs the limit standard level (0.2 \u03bcg\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>) of Maliszewska-Kordybach for agricultural soil pollution and exceeded the soil heavy pollution level limit value (1.0 \u03bcg\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>) in 41.4% of the sample sites. The concentration of BaP was above the risk control standard for soil contamination of agricultural land (0.55 \u03bcg\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>) in 10% of all the soil samples. A total of 11.4% of the sample soil \u03a3BaP<sub>eq</sub>16PAHs and \u03a3BaP<sub>eq</sub>8BPAHs exceeded the agricultural soil screening value (0.55 \u03bcg\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>). These results indicate that the contamination of PAHs was at a detectable level in the soil of wild <i>F. suspensa</i> growing in Shanxi, and thus their potential ecological risks should not be ignored. It is necessary to enhance the research regarding these areas to ensure the safe production of medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science, Shanxi Normal University, Linfen 041004, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jia-Jia", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science, Changzhi University, Changzhi 046011, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resource and Environment, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu 030801, China."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Min-Jie", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science, Changzhi University, Changzhi 046011, China."}], "LastName": "Jiao", "ForeName": "Hai-Hua", "Initials": "HH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science, Changzhi University, Changzhi 046011, China."}], "LastName": "Ru", "ForeName": "Wen-Ming", "Initials": "WM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Zhi-Hui", "Initials": "ZH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forsythia"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37177959", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202205356"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
