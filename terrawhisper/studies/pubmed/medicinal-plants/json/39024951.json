Despite revolutionary advancements in treatment, liver diseases remain a pressing issue, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic approaches. Here, we conducted a comprehensive multi-omics analysis to investigate the underlying mechanism of Swertiamarin in alleviating hepatic injuries induced by CCl<sub>4</sub> in mice. We divided 100 Kunming mice into five groups: RC (control), RM (CCl<sub>4</sub>), RD (15\u202fmg/Kg Swertiamarin), RZ (30\u202fmg/Kg Swertiamarin), and RG (60\u202fmg/Kg Swertiamarin). Animals in groups RD, RZ, and RG received daily Swertiamarin via gavage, while those in groups RM, RD, RZ, and RG were treated with CCl<sub>4</sub> solution intraperitoneally every four days, nine times in total. Our findings revealed that mice in the RM group exhibited slightly lower average weights compared to other groups, along with significantly higher liver weight (p<0.0001) and liver index (p<0.0001). Pathological analysis indicated liver damage characterized by cell degeneration, inflammatory cell infiltration, and hepatic fibrosis in the CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced group. In contrast, Swertiamarin supplementation mitigated these effects, reducing denatured cells, inflammatory cells, and collagenous fibers in the liver. Serum analysis showed elevated levels of TNF-\u03b1 (p<0.001), IL-6 (p<0.05), ALT (p<0.001), AST (p<0.0001), MDA (p<0.001), and Hyp (p<0.001) in CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced animals, along with lower levels of T-AOC (p<0.001), GSH-px (p<0.0001), SOD (p<0.001), and CAT (p<0.01). Microbiome analysis revealed significant differences among groups, with pathogenic taxa such as Arthrinium and Aureobasidium, and probiotic Saccharomyces showing notable variations. Metabolomics analysis identified numerous differentially abundant metabolites, with Swertiamarin-treated animals exhibiting distinct profiles. Our findings highlight the potential of Swertiamarin ameliorating CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver toxicity through modulation of antioxidant capacity, inflammatory response, gut microbiota, and metabolites. These insights may inform the development of novel therapies for liver injury."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
