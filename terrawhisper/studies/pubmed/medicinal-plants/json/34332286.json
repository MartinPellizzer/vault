The complex etiology and recent failures in clinical trials indicate the need for multitargeted agents.", "The present study aims to discover new plant-based multitargeted anti-AD leads.", "A library of plant extracts was screened for inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme\u00a01 (BACE-1). The secondary metabolites of active extracts were also tested, followed by enzyme-kinetics and molecular modeling to understand the mechanism of inhibition. The most active extract was investigated for in-vivo anti-dementia activity in behavioral mice models.", "Among the library of 105 extracts, Woodfordia fruticosa (SBE-80) and Bergenia ciliata (SBE-65) extracts displayed significant inhibition of all three enzymes. Gallic acid, one of the constituents of both plants, shows moderate inhibition of AChE and BACE-1. Catechin-3-O-gallate (CG), another constituent of SBE-65, inhibits EeAChE, rHuAChE, and eqBChE with IC<sub>50</sub>'s of 29.9, 1.77, and 8.4\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively; along with a mild-inhibition of BACE-1. Ellagic acid, the constituent of SBE-80, inhibits BACE-1 with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 16\u00a0\u00b5M. The W. fruticosa extract SBE-80 at the dose of 25\u00a0mg/kg QD\u00a0\u00d7\u00a09 (PO) displayed memory-enhancing activity in Morris Water Maze and Passive Avoidance Test in Swiss albino mice. Treatment with SBE-80 also inhibits AChE in-vivo; whereas, a non-significant decrease in the serum TBARS was observed.", "W. fruticosa is identified for the first time as an anti-AD lead candidate. The in-vitro and in-vivo data presented herein and the documented safety profile of W. fruticosa indicate its strong potential for preclinical development as a botanical drug for dementia/AD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
