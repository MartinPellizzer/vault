Herbal treatments are the most common and known methods of CAM. Based on the critical role of physicians in true and safe application of these products, this research evaluated knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of physicians in Rasht towards herbal remedies. This was a cross sectional study, performed between April 2017 and May 2019 on all physicians, who worked in Rasht city, northern Iran. A researcher-made questionnaire with 2 main parts, including a demographics section and research questions was used. A total of 142 (38%) individuals responded to the questionnaires. Mean KAP scores were 6.47\u2005\u00b1\u20056.17, 27.80\u2005\u00b1\u20053.26, and 5.02\u2005\u00b1\u20055.54, respectively. In none of these fields, significant differences were seen in participants regarding demographic variables, experience, work place, academic relevance, and field of work (P\u2005>\u2005.05). Physicians of Rasht city, with different work environments and regardless of demographic characteristics, had a positive view towards herbal remedies, without enough knowledge to consult their patients."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 the Author(s).
