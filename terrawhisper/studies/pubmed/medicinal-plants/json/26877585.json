The degree of phytochemical variation amongst wild populations has not been established and might affect the overall quality of elderberry dietary supplements. The three major flavonols identified in elderberries are rutin, quercetin and isoquercetin. Variation in the flavonols and chlorogenic acid was determined for 107 collections of elderberries from throughout the eastern United States using an optimized high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection method. The mean content was 71.9 mg per 100g fresh weight with variation ranging from 7.0 to 209.7 mg per 100 g fresh weight within the collected population. Elderberries collected from southeastern regions had significantly higher contents in comparison with those in more northern regions. The variability of the individual flavonol and chlorogenic acid profiles of the berries was complex and likely influenced by multiple factors. Several outliers were identified based on unique phytochemical profiles in comparison with average populations. This is the first study to determine the inherent variability of American elderberries from wild collections and can be used to identify potential new cultivars that may produce fruits of unique or high-quality phytochemical content for the food and dietary supplement industries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Applied Research and Innovation, British Columbia Institute of Technology, 3700 Willingdon Ave, Burnaby, British Columbia, V5G 3H2, Canada."}], "LastName": "Mudge", "ForeName": "Elizabeth", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Missouri Botanical Garden, PO Box 299, St. Louis, Missouri, 63166, USA."}], "LastName": "Applequist", "ForeName": "Wendy L", "Initials": "WL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Applied Research and Innovation, British Columbia Institute of Technology, 3700 Willingdon Ave, Burnaby, British Columbia, V5G 3H2, Canada."}], "LastName": "Finley", "ForeName": "Jamie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Applied Research and Innovation, British Columbia Institute of Technology, 3700 Willingdon Ave, Burnaby, British Columbia, V5G 3H2, Canada."}], "LastName": "Lister", "ForeName": "Patience", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Missouri Botanical Garden, PO Box 299, St. Louis, Missouri, 63166, USA."}], "LastName": "Townesmith", "ForeName": "Andrew K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Missouri Botanical Garden, PO Box 299, St. Louis, Missouri, 63166, USA."}], "LastName": "Walker", "ForeName": "Karen M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Applied Research and Innovation, British Columbia Institute of Technology, 3700 Willingdon Ave, Burnaby, British Columbia, V5G 3H2, Canada."}], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "Paula N", "Initials": "PN"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P50 AT006273", "Acronym": "AT", "Agency": "NCCIH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Compost Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "8807504", "ISSNLinking": "0889-1575"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Charlebois D.
