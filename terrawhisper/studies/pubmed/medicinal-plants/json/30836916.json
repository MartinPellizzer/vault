Resistance against the frontline anti-tubercular drugs has worsened the already alarming situation, which requires intensive drug discovery to develop new, more effective, affordable and accessible anti-tubercular agents possessing novel modes of action.", "Chemical transformation of dihydroartemisinin for anti-tubercular lead optimization.", "Dihydroartemisinin, a metabolite of artemisinin was chemically converted into eight acyl derivatives and were evaluated for anti-tubercular potential against H37Rv virulent strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by agar-based proportion assay. Further, synergistic activity of 12-O-m-anisoyl dihydroartemisinin was also studied with the front-line anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin.", "The results showed that all the derivatives were active but out of eight, 12-O-m-anisoyl dihydroartemisinin and 12-O-p-anisoyl dihydroartemisinin were significantly active (MIC 25.0 \u00b5g/mL). In synergistic activity evaluation, the 12-O-m-anisoyl dihydroartemisinin derivative showed reduction in MIC (by 1/8th, i.e. 3.12 \u00b5g/mL and that of rifampicin by \u00bcth, i.e. 0.05 \u00b5g/mL) with the front-line anti-TB drug, rifampicin. The sumfractional inhibitory concentration (\u03a3 FIC) was 0.375.", "These results suggested a synergistic effect of the 12-O-m-anisoyl dihydroartemisinin with rifampicin and established its base for the development of anti-tubercular agents from an in-expensive and non-toxic natural product.
