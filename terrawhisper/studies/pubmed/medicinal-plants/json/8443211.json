The more abundant cytochrome was purified to apparent homogeneity and exhibits visible region absorbance maxima at 416, 520 and 550 nm in the reduced form and at 410 and 530 nm in the oxidized form. Although Resonance Raman spectra of this cytochrome closely resemble those of c-type cytochromes, pyridine hemochromogen analysis suggests that this cytochrome may contain a variant of heme c as its prosthetic group. The cytochrome has an apparent molecular mass of 12.5 kDa, an isoelectric point > 9.0 and a midpoint oxidation-reduction potential (Em) of -130 mV at pH 8.0. The less abundant of the two cytochromes, which was not completely purified, exhibits absorbance maxima at 438 and 560 nm in the reduced form and at 411 nm in the oxidized form and was shown to contain heme c as a prosthetic group. This cytochrome, which may also contain FAD, has an apparent molecular mass of approx. 38 kDa, an isoelectric point > 9.0 and Em = -300 mV. Preliminary results indicate that both cytochromes can form electrostatically-stabilized complexes with ferredoxin, suggesting the possibility that one or both of the cytochromes may participate in low-potential, non-photosynthetic electron transfer pathways involving ferredoxin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Texas Tech University, Lubbock 79409-1061."}], "LastName": "Hirasawa", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "K T", "Initials": "KT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dose", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lou", "ForeName": "B S", "Initials": "BS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ondrias", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Knaff", "ForeName": "D B", "Initials": "DB"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM 33330", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biochim Biophys Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0217513", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochromes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferredoxins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Circular Dichroism"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochromes"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ferredoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrum Analysis, Raman"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8443211", "10.1016/0005-2728(93)90050-p", "0005-2728(93)90050-P"]}}]}
