Despite recent advances in understanding molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis and the improved neuroimaging technologies, surgery, and adjuvant treatments, the clinical prognosis of patients with GBM remains persistently unfavorable. The signaling pathways and the regulation of growth factors of glioblastoma cells are very abnormal. The various signaling pathways have been suggested to be involved in cellular proliferation, invasion, and glioma metastasis. The Wnt signaling pathway with its pleiotropic functions in neurogenesis and stem cell proliferation is implicated in various human cancers, including glioma. In addition, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is closely related to growth, metabolism, survival, angiogenesis, autophagy, and chemotherapy resistance of GBM. Understanding the mechanisms of GBM's invasion, represented by invasion and migration, is an important tool in designing effective therapeutic interventions. This review will investigate two main signaling pathways in GBM: PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infectious Diseases Research Center, Shahid Sadoughi Hospital, Shahid Sadoughi University of medical sciences, Yazd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shahcheraghi", "ForeName": "Seyed H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Comparative Anatomy, Experimental Anatomopathology and Surgery, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University des Montagnes, Bangangte, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Tchokonte-Nana", "ForeName": "Venant", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Shahid Sadoughi University of medical sciences, Yazd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Lotfi", "ForeName": "Marzieh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Lotfi", "ForeName": "Malihe", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghnia", "ForeName": "Hamid R", "Initials": "HR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "beta Catenin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "MTOR protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Glioblastoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "beta Catenin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32003685", "10.2174/1381612826666200131100630", "CPD-EPUB-104114"]}}]}
