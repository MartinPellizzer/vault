The behaviour of the solutes on SPE cartridges was predicted from preliminary calculations involving the pK(a) constants of the carboxylic groups, the n-octanol:water partition coefficients and the distribution coefficients at different pH values of the conditioning and washing solvents. The proposed SPE isolation and pre-concentration of the acids was achieved on reversed-phase Bond Elut C18 cartridges using an acetonitrile:tetrahydrofuran (1:1, v/v) elution system. RP-HPLC separations were performed on a Spherisorb ODS-2 column using linear gradient elution with a mobile phase composed of 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 2.92) and methanol, and with UV detection. The reported SPE and RP-HPLC methods were applied to the analysis of 49 authentic honey samples from various floral sources and the results indicate that they may serve with respect to the quantitative control of a number of phenolic acids in plant-derived foods and medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy at Medical University, 2 Dunav St, 1000 Sofia, Bulgaria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dimitrova", "ForeName": "Burya", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gevrenova", "ForeName": "Reneta", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anklam", "ForeName": "Elke", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochem Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "9200492", "ISSNLinking": "0958-0344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I3P9R8317T", "NameOfSubstance": "phenolic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Honey"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17260695", "10.1002/pca.948"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
