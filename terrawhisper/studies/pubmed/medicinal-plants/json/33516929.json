According to the theory of TCM, P. forrestii has the efficacy of relaxing tendons and activating collaterals, and dispelling wind and eliminating dampness. Hence, it was often used for the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and traumatic injury in clinical practice.", "This review aims to present comprehensive information for the research progress of P. forrestii. The researches on botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of the plant are summarized. We mainly focus on the phytochemical and pharmacological investigations. As a representative class of phytochemicals in P. forrestii, more attention is paid to cardiac glycosides. The insights into potential action of mechanisms and possible future studies on P. forrestii are also discussed.", "Relevant literature was acquired from scientific databases including Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scifinder, Baidu Scholar, PubMed and Chinese national knowledge infrastructure. Monographs and Chinese pharmacopoeia were also utilized as references.", "To date, all kinds of phytochemical constituents have been isolated and identified from this plant including cardiac glycosides, steroids, terpenoids, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, quinones, organic phenolic acids and others. Among these, cardiac glycosides were considered as the major ingredients and bioactive materials. Modern pharmacological studies demonstrated that the plant possessed extensive bioactivity, such as anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, immunosuppressive action, wound healing activity, antioxidant, anti-tumor and, cardiotonic properties.", "As an important medicinal plant, lots of studies have proved that P. forrestii has significant therapeutical effects, especially on rheumatoid arthritis and traumatic injury. These results provide modern scientific evidence for traditional use and contribute to the development of novel remedies for chronic diseases. However, the exact mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, the long-term in vivo toxicity and clinical efficacy also require in-depth exploration in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
