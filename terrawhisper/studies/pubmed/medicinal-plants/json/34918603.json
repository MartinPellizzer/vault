The levels of cytokines and chemokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The expression of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4, and the modulation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways were determined by Western blot.", "IOP significantly decreased the over-release of cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), IL-4, IL-6, interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in supernatant from <i>T. gondii-</i>infected splenic lymphocytes. IOP also effectively inhibited the overexpression of cytokines and chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA. Furthermore, IOP down-regulated TLR2 and TLR4 expressions and inhibited the over-phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB p65 and inhibitor \u03baB\u03b1 (I\u03baB\u03b1) in NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in MAPKs signaling pathway. By observing the effect of IOP on TNF-\u03b1 secretion after pretreatment with specific inhibitors, it was further confirmed that IOP was involved in the regulation of NF-\u03baB, p38, and JNK signaling pathways.", "These data indicate that IOP can inhibit the excessive inflammatory response caused by <i>T. gondii</i> infection through modulating NF-\u03baB, p38, and JNK signaling pathways, and thus plays the <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> anti-<i>T. gondii</i> role."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural College, Yanbian University, Yanji, China."}], "LastName": "Sang", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural College, Yanbian University, Yanji, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Fuliang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural College, Yanbian University, Yanji, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Hongyuan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural College, Yanbian University, Yanji, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural College, Yanbian University, Yanji, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Haitao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural College, Yanbian University, Yanji, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chunting", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural College, Yanbian University, Yanji, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xinhui", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural College, Yanbian University, Yanji, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural College, Yanbian University, Yanji, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center of North-East Cold Region Beef Cattle Science & Technology Innovation, Ministry of Education, Yanbian University, Yanji, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xuemei", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8800150", "ISSNLinking": "0892-3973"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Inonotus obliquus"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inonotus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Toxoplasma"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "40"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34918603", "10.1080/08923973.2021.2017453"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
