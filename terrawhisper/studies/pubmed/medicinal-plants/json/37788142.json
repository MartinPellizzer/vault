Of the many characteristics of mushrooms, aroma has received extensive attention and research as a key determinant of consumer preference. This paper reviews the production, role and contribution of common volatile compounds (VCs) in wild and cultivated mushrooms, and explores the methods used to characterize them and the factors influencing aroma. To date, more than 347 common VCs have been identified in mushrooms, such as aldehydes, ketones, alcohols and sulfur-containing compounds. Extraction and identification of VCs is a critical step and combining multiple analytical methods is an effective strategy in mushroom aroma studies. In addition, the VCs and the aroma of mushrooms are affected by a variety of factors such as genetics, growing conditions, and processing methods. However, the mechanism of influence is unknown. Further studies on the production mechanisms of VCs, their contribution to aroma, and the factors influencing their formation need to be determined in order to fully elucidate aroma and flavor of mushrooms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Guangmei", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jieqing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Key Laboratory of Gastrodia and Fungi Symbiotic Biology, Zhaotong University, Zhaotong, Yunnan, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Honggao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuanzhong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37788142", "10.1080/10408398.2023.2261133"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
