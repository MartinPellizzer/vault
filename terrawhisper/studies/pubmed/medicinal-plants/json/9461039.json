We have determined the structural requirements for this activity by examining the ability of naturally-occurring flavonoids to induce the phase II enzyme, quinone reductase (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase; EC 1.6.99.2), in murine Hepalclc7 cells. Hydroxylation of the B ring is not essential for induction, since galangin and kaempferol (with 0 and 1 hydroxyl in the B ring, respectively) are better inducers than quercetin (2 B ring hydroxyls). A 2,3 double bond in the C ring is essential for induction, since taxifolin, which has the same substitution pattern as quercetin but lacks the 2,3 double bond, is not an inducer. This is supported by catechin and epicatechin, which do not possess the 2,3 double bond and are also not inducers. A 3-hydroxyl group increases the activity but is not essential for induction, since apigenin is an inducer but kaempferol (which has the same structure as apigenin but possesses a 3-hydroxyl group) is more effective. The data show that, of the flavonoids, the flavonols are the most effective inducers of quinone reductase activity in Hepa1c1c7 cells (kaempferol approximately galangin > quercetin > myricetin approximately apigenin (a flavone)) and that flavanols and flavans are ineffective."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioproductive Science, Utsunomiya University, Japan."}], "LastName": "Uda", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Price", "ForeName": "K R", "Initials": "KR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Williamson", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rhodes", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7600053", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3835"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Kaempferols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142FWE6ECS", "NameOfSubstance": "galangin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "731P2LE49E", "NameOfSubstance": "kaempferol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "76XC01FTOJ", "NameOfSubstance": "myricetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8R1V1STN48", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9SOB9E3987", "NameOfSubstance": "taxifolin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.5.2", "NameOfSubstance": "NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Catechin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chamomile"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Induction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavonols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kaempferols"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9461039", "10.1016/s0304-3835(97)00311-x", "S0304-3835(97)00311-X"]}}]}
