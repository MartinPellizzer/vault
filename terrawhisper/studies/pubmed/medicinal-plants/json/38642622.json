Altschul in experimental elastase-induced pulmonary emphysema in rats.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "118216", "MedlinePgn": "118216"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Medicinal plants have shown promise in the search for new treatments of pulmonary emphysema. Anadenanthera colubrina, a species native to the Caatinga biome in northeastern Brazil, is widely recognized and traditionally employed in the treatment of pulmonary diseases. Many studies corroborate popular knowledge about the medicinal applications of A. colubrina, which has demonstrated a remarkable variety of pharmacological properties, however, its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties are highlighted.", "The objective of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory potential of the crude hydroethanolic extract of A. colubrina var. cebil (Griseb.) Altschul on pulmonary emphysema in rats as well as to determine its potential genotoxic and cytotoxic effects using the micronucleus assay.", "The stem bark of the plant was collected in Pimenteiras-PI and sample was extracted by maceration using 70% ethanol. A portion of the extract underwent phytochemical analyses using TLC and HPLC. In this study, 8-week-old, male Wistar rats weighing approximately \u00b1200\u00a0g was utilized following approval by local ethics committee for animal experimentation (No. 718/2022). Pulmonary emphysema was induced through orotracheal instillation of elastase, and treatment with A. colubrina extract or dexamethasone (positive control) concomitantly during induction. Twenty-eight days after the initiation of the protocol, plasma was used for cytokine measurement. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was used for leukocyte count. After euthanasia, lung samples were processed for histological analysis and quantification of oxidative stress markers. The micronucleus test was performed by evaluating the number of polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) with micronuclei (MNPCE) to verify potential genotoxic effects of A. colubrina. A differential count of PCE and normochromatic erythrocytes (NCE) was performed to verify the potential cytotoxicity of the extract. Parametric data were subjected to normality analysis and subsequently to analysis of variance and Tukey or Dunnett post-test, non-parametric data were treated using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's post-test for unpaired samples. P value\u00a0<\u00a00.05 were considered significant.", "The A. colubrina extract did not show a significant increase in the number of MNPCE (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05), demonstrating low genotoxicity. No changes were observed in the PCE/NCE ratio of treated animals, compared with the vehicle, suggesting low cytotoxic potential of the extract. A significant reduction (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in neutrophilic inflammation was observed in the lungs of rats treated with the extract, evidenced by presence of these cells in both the tissue and BAL. The extract also demonstrated pulmonary antioxidant activity, with a significant decrease (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde, and nitrite levels. TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 levels, as well as alveolar damage, were significantly reduced in animals treated with A. colubrina extract. Phytochemical analyses identified the presence of phenolic compounds and hydrolysable tannins in the A. colubrina extract.", "The findings of this study highlights the safety of the hydroethanolic extract of Anadenanthera colubrina, and demonstrates its potential as a therapeutic approach in the treatment of emphysema. The observed properties of this medicinal plant provide an optimistic outlook in the development of therapies for the treatment of pulmonary emphysema."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
