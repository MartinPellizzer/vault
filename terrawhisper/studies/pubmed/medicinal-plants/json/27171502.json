We found that treatment with UA suppressed the viability of human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells and induced cell cycle arrest at sub-G1 and G2/M phases. Furthermore, exposure to UA induced intracellular oxidative stress and collapse of mitochondrial membrane permeability, resulting in the subsequent activation of apoptotic caspases 8, 9, and 3 as well as PARP cleavage, and ultimately apoptosis in MG-63 cells. Moreover, protein analysis of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-related protein expression showed an increase in activated ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK in UA-treated MG-63 cells. In addition, UA-induced apoptosis was significantly abolished in MG-63 cells that had been pretreated with inhibitors of caspase 3, 8, and 9 and ERK1/2. Furthermore, UA-treated MG-63 cells also exhibited an enhancement in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, whereas anti-apoptotic XIAP and survivin were down-regulated. Taken together, we provide evidence demonstrating that UA mediates caspase-dependent and ERK1/2 MAPK-associated apoptosis in osteosarcoma MG-63 cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orthopedics & Sports Medicine Laboratory, Changhua Christian Hospital , Changhua 50006, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Changhua Christian Hospital , Changhua 50006, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University , Taichung 40227, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Chia-Chieh", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orthopedics & Sports Medicine Laboratory, Changhua Christian Hospital , Changhua 50006, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Chun-Hsiang", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University , Taichung 40227, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Yi-Hui", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Changhua Christian Hospital , Changhua 50006, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Ing-Lin", "Initials": "IL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Changhua Christian Hospital , Changhua 50006, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hsin-Yao", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orthopedics & Sports Medicine Laboratory, Changhua Christian Hospital , Changhua 50006, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Changhua Christian Hospital , Changhua 50006, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Hsieh", "ForeName": "Chen-Pu", "Initials": "CP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University , Taichung 40227, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Asia University , Taichung 41354, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Basic Medicine, China Medical University , Taichung 40402, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital , Taichung 40402, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chueh", "ForeName": "Pin-Ju", "Initials": "PJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 8"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 9"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics", "metabolism", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 8"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 9"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "MAP Kinase Signaling System"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics", "metabolism", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Osteosarcoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ursolic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27171502", "10.1021/acs.jafc.6b00542"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
