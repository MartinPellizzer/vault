However, a systematic metabolomic and bioactivity evaluation of different plant parts from both species is lacking. In this study, comprehensive investigations of 11 plant parts of <i>G. yunnanensis</i> and 10 of <i>G. xanthochymus</i> employing UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS<sup>E</sup>-based metabolomic analysis in conjunction with three bioactivity assays were undertaken. A customized chemotaxonomic-based in-house library containing 6456 compounds was constructed and coupled to the Progenesis QI informatic platform for metabolite annotations. From these two species, a total of 235 constituents were characterized using multiple criteria. Differences in metabolite profiles between the plant parts within each species were uncovered using multivariate analysis. Based on orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), 23 markers were identified as highly differential metabolites from <i>G. xanthochymus</i> and 20 from <i>G. yunnanensis</i>. Comparative assessment of the biological assays revealed the activity variations among different plant parts. The seeds of both species and <i>G. yunnanensis</i> latex exhibited excellent cytotoxic and antibacterial activities, while <i>G. xanthochymus</i> roots and <i>G. yunnanensis</i> arils showed strong anti-inflammatory effects. <i>S</i>-plot analysis identified 26 potential biomarkers for the observed activities, including the known cytotoxic agent cycloxanthochymol and the anti-inflammatory compound garcimultiflorone B, which likely explains some of the potent observed bioactivity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Ecology and Environment in Minority Areas, Minzu University of China, National Ethnic Affairs Commission of China, Beijing 100081, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Minzu University of China, Beijing 100081, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Ethnomedicine, Minzu University of China, Ministry of Education, Beijing 100081, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby V5A 1S6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Fengke", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Lehman College, City University of New York, New York, New York 10468, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PhD Program in Biology, The Graduate Center, City University of New York, New York, New York 10016, United States."}], "LastName": "Kennelly", "ForeName": "Edward J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1818-4971"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby V5A 1S6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Linington", "ForeName": "Roger G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6573-6049"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Ecology and Environment in Minority Areas, Minzu University of China, National Ethnic Affairs Commission of China, Beijing 100081, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Minzu University of China, Beijing 100081, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Ethnomedicine, Minzu University of China, Ministry of Education, Beijing 100081, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Mass Spectrometry Imaging and Metabolomics, Minzu University of China, National Ethnic Affairs Commission of China, Beijing 100081, China."}], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Chunlin", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garcinia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37154236", "10.1021/acs.jafc.2c08372"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
