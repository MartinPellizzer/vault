The response to therapy is notably influenced by various patient-specific genetic factors, underscoring the disease's complexity. Despite the utilization of diverse treatment modalities such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, many patients experience local relapse, emphasizing the critical need for improved therapeutic strategies to effectively target these formidable tumors. Recent years have witnessed a surge in interest in natural products derived from plants, particularly alkaloids, for their potential anticancer effects. Alkaloids have shown promise in cancer chemotherapy by selectively targeting crucial signaling pathways implicated in tumor progression and survival. Specifically, they modulate the NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways, resulting in reduced tumor growth and altered gene expression across various cancer types. Additionally, alkaloids exhibit the capacity to induce cell cycle arrest, further impeding tumor proliferation in several malignancies. This review aims to delineate recent advances in understanding the pathology of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and to explore the potential therapeutic implications of alkaloids in managing this deadly disease. By segregating discussions on GBM pathology from those on alkaloid-based therapies, we provide a structured overview of the current challenges in GBM treatment and the promising opportunities presented by alkaloid-based interventions. Furthermore, we briefly discuss potential future directions in GBM research and therapy beyond alkaloids, including emerging treatment modalities or areas of investigation that hold promise for improving patient outcomes. In conclusion, our efforts offer hope for enhanced outcomes and improved quality of life for GBM patients through alkaloid-based therapies. By integrating insights from pathology and therapeutic perspectives, we underscore the significance of a comprehensive approach in addressing this devastating disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
