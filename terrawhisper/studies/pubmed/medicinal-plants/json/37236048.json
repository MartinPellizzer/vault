ETs from medicinal plants are focused increasingly due to urolithins, a kind of intestinal metabolite of ETs, which showed promising anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) effects. Melastoma dodecandrum (MD), a widely used traditional Chinese medicine is rich in ETs, but their chemistry and potential neuroprotective effects have not been investigated.", "This study aimed to identify the chemical composition of ETs in the crude extract of MD and to investigate their neuroprotective effects in vivo.", "UPLC-QTOF-MS-based molecular networking (MN) and structural characterization were applied to targeted profiling of the MD-ETs. Animal behavior experiments, including the novel object recognition test (NOR), open field test (OFT), and Morris water maze test (MWM), were conducted to assess the memory improvement effects of MD-ETs in AD model mice.", "A total of 70 ETs, ranging from monomers to tetramers, were tracked and characterized in the MD extract using MN-guided targeted profiling, with 59 of them reported for the first time in this species. MD-ETs significantly improved memory impairment in AD mice, as indicated by decreased escape latency, increased number of crossings and target quadrant distance in MWM, increased rearing number in OFT, and increased preference index in NOR.", "This study systematically characterized the composition and structural features of ETs in MD using targeted LC-MS profiling, expanding the chemical information of ETs in MD. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that MD-ETs have significant effects on improving impaired memory in AD mice, suggesting their potential as alternative natural medicines for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier GmbH.
