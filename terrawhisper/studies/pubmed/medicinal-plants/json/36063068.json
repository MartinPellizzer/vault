The concept of genetic engineering is used for molecular pharming. As more people use plants as sources of nanotechnology systems, they are adding to this. These systems are made up of viruses-like particles (VLPs) and virus nanoparticles (VNPs). Due to their superior ability to be used as plant virus expression vectors, plant viruses are becoming more popular in pharmaceuticals. This has opened the door for them to be used in research, such as the production of medicinal peptides, antibodies, and other heterologous protein complexes. This is because biotechnological approaches have been linked with new bioinformatics tools. Because of the rise of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, it has become easier to use metagenomic studies to look for plant virus genomes that could be used in pharmaceutical research. A look at how bioinformatics can be used in pharmaceutical research is also covered in this article. It also talks about plant viruses and how new biotechnological tools and procedures have made progress in the field."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0234-6633"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Palli Siksha Bhavana (Institute of Agriculture), Visva-Bharati University, Sriniketan, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Debnath", "ForeName": "Sandip", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9642-1421"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Palli Siksha Bhavana (Institute of Agriculture), Visva-Bharati University, Sriniketan, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Seth", "ForeName": "Dibyendu", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8848-3275"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Palli Siksha Bhavana (Institute of Agriculture), Visva-Bharati University, Sriniketan, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Pramanik", "ForeName": "Sourish", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5603-6211"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Palli Siksha Bhavana (Institute of Agriculture), Visva-Bharati University, Sriniketan, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Adhikari", "ForeName": "Sanchari", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4765-1359"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Palli Siksha Bhavana (Institute of Agriculture), Visva-Bharati University, Sriniketan, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Mondal", "ForeName": "Parimita", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7134-3655"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Palli Siksha Bhavana (Institute of Agriculture), Visva-Bharati University, Sriniketan, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Sherpa", "ForeName": "Dechen", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2311-9739"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Palli Siksha Bhavana (Institute of Agriculture), Visva-Bharati University, Sriniketan, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Sen", "ForeName": "Deepjyoti", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7566-3843"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "MBBS, Jinan University: Guangzhou, Guangdong, P.R.
