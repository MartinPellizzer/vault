The toxic constituent is an amino acid identified as B-Oxalyl-Amino L-Alanine (BOAA). It has been reported that if the legume is boiled for two hours and the water is then decanted, almost 85% of the toxic amino acid is eliminated. Therefore, this investigation constitutes an effort to prevent the loss of other nutrients, simultaneously to the elimination of toxicity. As has been observed, as much as half the protein content, as well as 80.36% total sugars, 63.13% reducing sugars, 86.05% amino acids, and all thiamine, riboflavin and niacin are lost from dahl (dehulled, separated cotyledons), while the respective losses from the whole seeds are 47.25%, 45.73%, 74.69% and 80.00%, and all vitamins, in just a one-hour treatment. The losses of the toxic amino acid from dahl and whole seeds are 71.46% and 68.74%, respectively. The data for losses occurring in the two-hour and three-hour treatment are also described."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Basic Sciences and Humanities, Rajendra Agricultural University, Pusa, Samastipur, India."}], "LastName": "Jha", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids, Diamino"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1TG777QI25", "NameOfSubstance": "oxalyldiaminopropionic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids, Diamino"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3454610"]}}]}
