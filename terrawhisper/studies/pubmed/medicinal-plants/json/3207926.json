Commercial preparations, and fresh samples of the root of this plant from Fiji, lacked this compound. Two previously described N-cinnamoyl pyrrolidine alkaloids were also observed along with stigmasterol in kava resin from Fiji and Vanuatu. The products derived from aqueous 2 M hydrochloric acid extraction of P. methysticum were determined from methane chemical ionization gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis which identified a series of hydroxylated compounds (15a-d) derived from formal decarbonylation of the parent kava lactones. The products (13a-c) of dehydration of these compounds were also observed. The efficiency of kava resin extraction from plant material by water (the traditional method of preparation of the kava beverage) was typically 5-10% of that recovered by direct extraction with an organic solvent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Unit, University of New South Wales, Kensington, Australia."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lidgard", "ForeName": "R O", "Initials": "RO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Duffield", "ForeName": "P H", "Initials": "PH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Duffield", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brophy", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Environ Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "8603224", "ISSNLinking": "0887-6134"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fiji"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3207926", "10.1002/bms.1200170505"]}}]}
