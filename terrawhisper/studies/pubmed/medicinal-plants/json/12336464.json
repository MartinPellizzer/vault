The Magahats are aware that the sexual union is needed for conception. Once the signs of pregnancy are positive, taboos are observed: these include such diverse behaviors as avoidance of eclipses and certain foods, all of which are related to some aspect of child's development which would be thwarted were the mother to participate in taboo practices. When the pregnancy is certain, the mother of the women becomes her advisor; the pregnant woman is instructed to bath in a particular stream and is given a tonic of roots in boiled water daily during the remainder of the pregnancy. Ceremonies, performed traditionally by the babaylan (medicine man) to counteract fears of hard delivery and to appease Apila, the goddess of pregnant women, are related. During childbirth, the women are expected to suffer in silence, as submitting to the pain would make the woman lose face among her tribe. The actual delivery procedure, which requires the obstetrical assistance of a babaylan, who in this role is called partera, is described in detail. Magahatan women deliver in a sittingposition, with the back firmly pressed against a wall. A rope is hung from the roof directly in front of the woman, and she hangs onto the rope to attain thedelivery position. At birth, the infant is swaddled and rolled on a mat to stimulate blood circulation. The placenta is squeezed to stimulate the child's breathing. The babaylan then cuts the placental cord with a bamboo knife and ties it witha white thread about 4 fingers above the infant's navel. Rituals to hastn difficult deliveries are described. After birth, the infant is continually breast-fed until the next sign of pregnancy."]}], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "PMID": "12336464", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1980", "Month": "09", "Day": "08"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "01"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0031-7810", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "13", "Issue": "4", "PubDate": {"Year": "1965"}}, "Title": "Philippine sociological review", "ISOAbbreviation": "Philipp Sociol Rev"}, "ArticleTitle": "Magahat pregnancy and birth practices.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "268", "EndPage": "274", "MedlinePgn": "268-74"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oracion", "ForeName": "T S", "Initials": "TS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Philippines", "MedlineTA": "Philipp Sociol Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "101085501"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia, Southeastern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery, Obstetric"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Midwifery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Philippines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1965", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1965", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12336464"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
