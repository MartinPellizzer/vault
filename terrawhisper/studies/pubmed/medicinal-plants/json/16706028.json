A strip of small intestine was taken from distal end of ileum for light microscopic examination, Chiu's score and the detection of intestinal water content (IWC). Apoptosis of intestinal mucosa cell was examined by TUNEL method. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondisldehyde (MDA) concentration of intestinal mucosa were detected. The protein express of Bcl-2 of intestinal mucosa was analyzed by immunochemistory.", "Intestinal /R resulted in histopathological changes in intestinal mucosa, increased Chiu's scores, apoptosis index, IWC and MDA content, and reduced SOD activity and the protein expression of Bcl-2 significantly (P < 0.01). The pretreatment of SND could attenuate the above changes significantly (P < 0.01), but there was no significant difference for the above variables between SND low dose group and SND high dose group (P > 0.05). Apoptosis index was significantly negatively correlative to SOD activity in model group and two SND groups. There were significantly negative correlation between apoptosis index and protein expression of Bcl-2 in model group and SND low dose group.", "SND can attenuate intestinal mucosa injury following intestinal U/R, which is related to reducing intestinal mucosa cell apoptosis by removing oxygen free radical and upregulating the protein expression of Bcl-2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Anesthesiology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China. liukexuan807@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ke-Xuan", "Initials": "KX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Wei-Kang", "Initials": "WK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Hui-Lan", "Initials": "HL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aconitum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zingiber officinale"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza uralensis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16706028"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
