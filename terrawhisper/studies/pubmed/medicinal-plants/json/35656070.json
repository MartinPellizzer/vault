Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer, highly aggressive with high mortality and incidence rate; and has limited therapeutic options. Most of the conventional cancer chemotherapeutics are associated with undesirable side effects, toxicity, chemoresistance, and high treatment cost, driving the need for a safer and more effective treatment alternative. Medicinal plants and herbs have shown very promising anti-cancer properties which are important for cancer treatment due to their multiple chemical compounds.", "Qualitative screening of the ethanolic extractof <i>Allium sativum</i> was conducted showing the different phytochemicalspresent. The levels of liver function and hematological parameters wasdetermined via spectrophotometric analysis. Polymerase Chain Reaction techniquewas used to assess the gene patterns of Tumorsuppressor p53 (TP53).", "Phytochemical analysis revealed that <i>Allium sativum</i> has properties that antagonize the proliferating process of carcinogenesis in the liver. The NDEA-group showed significant distortion in the liver architecture characterized by vascular congestion of blood sinusoids, cirrhosis, and congestive hepatopathy while the treated groups showed a reduction in the abnormalities and malignant formation. The treated group showed a significant (<i>P</i><0.05) increase and restored activities of Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Bilirubin and hematological parameters (RBCs, WBCs, and Platelets). <i>TP53</i> gene amplification was significantly (<i>P</i><0.05) visible after treatment.", "Ethanolic plant extract of <i>A. sativum</i> demonstrates its anticancer properties by improving the liver architecture, increasing the antioxidant defense systems, and activation of the tumor suppressor (<i>TP53</i>) gene. Garlic extract has anti-proliferating properties and can be used as an alternative mode of treatment and prevention for hepatocellular carcinoma."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Research and Infectious Disease Unit, Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, University of Lagos, Akoka, Lagos."}], "LastName": "Ogar", "ForeName": "Godwin Offumobi", "Initials": "GO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Research and Infectious Disease Unit, Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, University of Lagos, Akoka, Lagos."}], "LastName": "Minari", "ForeName": "Joseph Bamidele", "Initials": "JB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Research and Infectious Disease Unit, Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, University of Lagos, Akoka, Lagos."}], "LastName": "Bello", "ForeName": "Adebayo Joseph", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Research and Infectious Disease Unit, Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, University of Lagos, Akoka, Lagos."}], "LastName": "Chiwetalu", "ForeName": "Janet", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Research and Infectious Disease Unit, Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, University of Lagos, Akoka, Lagos."}], "LastName": "Omogunwa", "ForeName": "Oluwafunto Eunice", "Initials": "OE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Research and Infectious Disease Unit, Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, University of Lagos, Akoka, Lagos."}], "LastName": "Oshikoya", "ForeName": "Oluwadamilola Suzan", "Initials": "OS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Research and Infectious Disease Unit, Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, University of Lagos, Akoka, Lagos."}], "LastName": "Otaru", "ForeName": "Micheal Tobiloba", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Research and Infectious Disease Unit, Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, University of Lagos, Akoka, Lagos."}], "LastName": "Anyanele", "ForeName": "Chioma Anastacia", "Initials": "CA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Iran J Basic Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101517966", "ISSNLinking": "2008-3866"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no competing interests."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Ohiagu FO, Chikezie CP, Chikezie CM, Enyoh CE.
