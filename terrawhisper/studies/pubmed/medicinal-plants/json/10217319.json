New pharmacological and clinical results focus on hyperforin as the main active ingredient of the drug. Hyperforin (C35H52O4) is one of the main components (2-4%) of the dried herb Hypericum perforatum L. It was isolated after six consecutive steps: extraction of deep-frozen blossoms (-20 degrees C) with n-hexane by means of an Ultra Turrax at room temperature; separation of lipophilic substances on a silica gel column; purification of the relevant fraction by preparative HPLC; evaporation of the mobile phase under reduced pressure; removal of the remaining water by freeze-drying; and storage of hyperforin at -20 degrees C under nitrogen. The identity and purity of the isolated substance were determined by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode-array and ultraviolet detection (DAD and UV), Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, and liquid chromatography coupled with positive-ion electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI(+)-MS-MS). By use of these methods the purity of hyperforin was shown to be >99.9%. Peroxides present at each step of the isolation were detected by titration and by means of Merckoquant analytical peroxide test-strips. Elimination of the peroxides and stabilization of hyperforin was achieved by consistent protection from oxidation-the mobile phases were protected by use of ascorbic acid; evaporation and freeze-drying were performed under nitrogen; and the mobile phase used for preparative HPLC was sparged with helium. Stability testing was performed by HPLC-the samples were stored at -30 degrees C in a normal atmosphere and at -20, 4, and 20 degrees C in a normal atmosphere or under nitrogen. Results were compared with those obtained after storage under liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C). Because of its high sensitivity to oxidation, hyperforin was more stable under nitrogen under all test conditions. There was no statistically significant difference between results obtained after 8 months at -20 degrees C under nitrogen or at -30 degrees C under a normal atmosphere and those from the reference sample stored under liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C). Despite this, because of the tendency of hyperforin to degrade, long-term storage at -70 degrees C under nitrogen is recommended."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Eberhard-Karls University, T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Orth", "ForeName": "H C", "Initials": "HC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rentel", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schmidt", "ForeName": "P C", "Initials": "PC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DHD7FFG6YS", "NameOfSubstance": "Phloroglucinol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RM741E34FP", "NameOfSubstance": "hyperforin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Storage"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ericales"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Phloroglucinol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10217319", "10.1211/0022357991772132"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
