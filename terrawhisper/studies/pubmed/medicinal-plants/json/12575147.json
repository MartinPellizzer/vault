The cell suspension culture and plate culture were also investigated in this paper. The results showed that the medium of MS which contained 2,4-D 1 mg/L and NAA 1 mg/L was the best one for inducing callus. The plant growth regulator of 2,4-D was assential for callus and suspension culture. Factors such as the time of cell suspension culture, the ways of plating and cell density, which affects the plating efficency were studied. The results showed that plating at density of 5 x 10(3) cells/ml and with monocells seperated from the cells cultured 14-21 days, high plating efficiency could be obtained either by conditional plate culture or by nursing plate culture."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Colloge of Life Science, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453002."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12575147"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
