After extraction with ethyl acetate, the plasma samples were analyzed by HPLC/MS and the mobile phase was a mixture of methanol-water-acetic acid (60: 40: 0. 8) at the flow rate of 1.0 mL x min(-1). The API-ES positive ion SIM detection was carried out for the detection of both (-)-clau ([M + H] (+), m/z 298 ) and 6-OH-clau ([M + H - H2 O](+), m/z 296) with glipzide (glip) ([M + H](+), m/z 446) as internal standard. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by 3P97 software.", "There was good linear relationship ( r > 0. 999) between the SIM responses and the concentrations for (-)-clau and 6-OH-clau at the range from 1.0 to 200 ng x mL(-1) and 0.2 to 40.0 ng x mL(-1), respectively. The absolute recovery was greater than 85%. The plasma concentration-time curves of (-)-clau and 6-OH-clau were both best fitted to a two-compartment model. The C(max) of (-)-clau and 6-OH-clau were (21 +/- 10) ng x mL(-1) and (3.9 +/- 2.2) ng x mL(-1), T(max) were (0.8 +/- 0.5) h and (1.3 +/- 0.5) h, T 1/2 alpha were (0.9 +/- 0.6) hand (1.4 +/- 0.6) h, T 1/2 beta were (19 +/- 23) hand (13 +/- 12) h, AUC(0-24 h) were (69 +/- 14) h x ng x mL(-1) and (12 +/- 7) h x ng x mL(-1) respectively.", "The established HPLC/MS method was sensitive and specific for the determination of (-)-clau. It was shown that the absorption and first phase elimination of (-)-clau were very quick in Beagle dogs, but the terminal elimination was very slow. The plasma concentration profile of its major metabolite 6-OH-clau was similar to (-)-clau and the AUC was relatively small in comparison with (-)-clau."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hang", "ForeName": "Tai-Jun", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zheng-Xing", "Initials": "ZX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "6-hydroxyl-clausenamide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactams"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "103541-15-7", "NameOfSubstance": "clausenamide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Area Under Curve"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Lactams"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Lignans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rutaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16408814"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
