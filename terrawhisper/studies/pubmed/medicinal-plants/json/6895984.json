This paper examines the effect of gossypol acetic acid and cottonseed oil buffer emulsion on human spermatozoal motility. Gossypol solution was prepared as described. Equal volumes of human semen and test solutions were mixed thoroughly for spermatozoal motility microscopic examination. A photographic tracking method described in an earlier paper was used to measure progressive spermatozoal motility. A slight but reproducible stimulation in spermatozoal activity was observed at low gossypol acetic acid concentrations (10-5M). Increased motility was observed throughout the experiment. At 10-3M gossypol concentration, complete abolition of spermatozoal motility occurred; at this concentration, the preparation contained minute crystals of gossypol acetic acid. Similar results were seen with rat epididymis spermatozoa. Spermatozoal progressive motility was completely abolished by cottonseed oil, either as saturated emulsion or 5 times diluted, and independent of whether or not solid kernel particles were present in the emulsion. An effective uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, gossypol reduces spermatozoal adenosine triphosphate content and thus reduces motility as observed in boar, human, and rat spermatozoa. As a 5-fold diluted sample of cottonseed oil showed significant spermatozoal antimotility activity, and cottonseed oil has little side effects and is economical to use, use of this natural oil as a contraceptive for vaginal application should be investigated."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["007215", "00107635"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: ARCHIVES OF ANDROLOGY."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Contraception", "Contraceptive Agents", "Contraceptive Agents, Male", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Family Planning", "Health", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Plants, Medicinal", "Sperm Immobilizing Agents", "Spermicidal Contraceptive Agents"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "6895984", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1982", "Month": "05", "Day": "12"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "09", "Day": "13"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0148-5016", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "8", "Issue": "1", "PubDate": {"Year": "1982", "Month": "Feb"}}, "Title": "Archives of andrology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Arch Androl"}, "ArticleTitle": "Cottonseed oil as a vaginal contraceptive.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "11", "EndPage": "14", "MedlinePgn": "11-4"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["The effect of gossypol acetic acid an cottonseed oil emulsion on human spermatozoal motility was tested.
