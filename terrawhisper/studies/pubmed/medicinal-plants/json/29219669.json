Zhi-Zi-Da-Huang decoction (ZZDHD) has been widely used for the treatment of alcoholic jaundice, alcoholic liver disease, and acute hepatitis in China for thousands of years. Conventionally decoctions are administered orally, after which the metabolism caused by the enzymes in intestinal bacteria may influence significantly on the curative effects or toxicity. 2. In this work, the comprehensive metabolic process of ZZDHD in intestinal bacteria was investigated reliably using high-resolution HPLC-DAD-ESI-TOF/MS. Besides, a novel strategy for major-to-trace metabolites identification which integrated information derived from diagnostic fragment ions, mass spectral similarity filter strategy, dynamic metabolic change of target compounds and relevant behavior in LC-MS was adopted. 3. As a result, 45 compounds, including 26 bio-converted prototypes and 19 newly generated metabolites were detected and tentatively identified. The metabolic profile of ZZDHD in gastro-intestinal was subsequently elucidated. Deglycosylation, oxidation, reduction, acetylation, and ring cleavage were all observed in the biotransformation of the decoction. Among the rest, deglycosylation was found to be the predominant metabolic pathway. 4. The results obtained herein provided a practical strategy for metabolic profile elucidation of traditional herbal medicines. Moreover, it would be helpful to unravel how the oral decoctions play the therapeutic role in vivo."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis , China Pharmaceutical University , Nanjing , China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Miao", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis , China Pharmaceutical University , Nanjing , China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Jiangsu Institute for Food and Drug Control , Nanjing , China , and."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Qingshui", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, China Pharmaceutical University, Ministry of Education , Nanjing , China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Gongjun", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis , China Pharmaceutical University , Nanjing , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, China Pharmaceutical University, Ministry of Education , Nanjing , China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Xenobiotica", "NlmUniqueID": "1306665", "ISSNLinking": "0049-8254"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "zhi-zi-da-huang"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Microbiome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29219669", "10.1080/00498254.2017.1414972"]}}]}
