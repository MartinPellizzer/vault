The current study was aimed to assess the anti-diabetic potentials of Fagonia cretica mediated biogenic selenium nanoparticles (FcSeNPs) using in-vitro and in-vivo approaches. The bio-synthesized FcSeNPs were characterized using various techniques including UV-VIS spectrophotometry and FTIR analysis. The in-vitro efficacy of FcSeNPs were assessed against \u03b1-glucosidase, \u03b1-amylase enzymes as well as the anti-radical studies were performed using DPPH and ABTS free radicals scavenging assays. For in-vivo studies, 20 Male Balb/C albino-mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n\u00a0=\u00a05) including normal group, disease group (Diabetic group with no treatment), control group and treatment group (Diabetic group treated with FcSeNPs). Further, biochemistry markers including pancreas, liver, kidney and lipid profile were assessed for all treatment groups. The FcSeNPs exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition against \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase at 62-1000\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> concentration with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 92 and 100\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> respectively. In antioxidant experiments, the FcSeNPs demonstrated significant radicals scavenging effect against DPPH and ABTS radicals. In STZ-induced diabetic mice, a considerable decline in blood glucose level was observed after treatment with FcSeNPs. Anti-hyperglycemic effect of FcSeNPs treated animals were high (105\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.22**) as compared to standard drug (128.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.73**\u00a0mg\u00a0dL<sup>-1</sup>). Biochemical investigations revealed that all biochemical parameters for pancreas, liver function, renal function panel and lipid profile were significantly lowered in FcSeNPs treated animals. Our findings indicate a preliminary multi-target efficacy for FcSeNPs against type-2 diabetes and thus warrant further detailed studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
