The present study was performed to scrutinize the anti-cancer potential of compounds <i>P. betle</i> petiole by means of <i>in silico</i> studies, purification of 4-Allylbenzene-1,2-diol from petioles and assessing its cytotoxicity on bone cancer metastasis. Subsequent to SwissADME screening, 4-Allylbenzene-1,2-diol and Alpha terpineol were chosen for molecular docking together with eighteen approved drugs against fifteen important bone cancer targets accompanied with molecular dynamics simulation studies. 4-Allylbenzene-1,2-diol was found to be multi-targeting, interacted effectively with all targets, particularly exhibited good stability with MMP9 and MMP2 during molecular dynamics simulations and Molecular Mechanics- Generalized Born and Surface Area (MM-GBSA) analysis using Schrodinger. Later, the compound was isolated, purified and the cytotoxicity studies on MG63 bone cancer cell lines confirmed the cytotoxicity nature (75.98% at 100\u2009\u00b5g/ml concentration). The results demonstrated the compound as a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, and therefore 4-Allylbenzene-1,2-diol may possibly be prescribed in targeted therapy for alleviating the bone cancer metastasis upon further wet lab experimental validations.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
