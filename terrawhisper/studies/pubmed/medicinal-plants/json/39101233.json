Therefore, new antibiotics need to be developed quickly. Most of the antibiotics we use today are derived from secondary metabolites, which are produced by plants. Genome mining tools allow us to detect biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) responsible for the production of secondary metabolites. Focusing on the most promising BGCs-coding antibiotics with unique pathways is currently a challenge. <i>In silico</i> approach like genome mining are used to visualise the action of these bioactive chemicals. <i>Camelina sativa</i> is a well-known medicinal plant and it would be interesting to study its secondary metabolites. In this work, we found seven bioactive compounds in this plant using the genome mining approach. Further, the clusters of genes involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds were analysed with their metabolic pathways. This work illuminates new ground on the evolution of BGCs for the nutritional improvement of <i>C. sativa.</i>"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science, Guru Nanak Institute of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Kolkata, India."}], "LastName": "Siddiqui", "ForeName": "Shagufi Zea", "Initials": "SZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science, Guru Nanak Institute of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Kolkata, India."}], "LastName": "Saleha", "ForeName": "Zaryab", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science, Guru Nanak Institute of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Kolkata, India."}], "LastName": "Nayak", "ForeName": "Aditi", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39101233", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2385695"]}}]}
