However, the potential roles of KOR and the analogues isolated from the leaves of Cyclocarya paliurus in anti-erythroleukemia remain unclear. In the present study, KOR and the two analogues (Kaempferol-3-O-(4\u2033-O-acetyl-a-L-rhamnopyranoside) (KLR) and (kaempferol-3-O-\u03b1-L-(4\u2033-E-p-coumaroyl) rhamnoside) (KCR) were isolated from leaves of Cyclocarya paliurus. Cell viability assay showed that KCR exerted an excellent anti-erythroleukemia activity. We observed that KCR not only significantly increased the percentage of G2 phase and apoptotic cells compared with control group, but also induced megakaryocytic differentiation in HEL and K562 cells by flow cytometry, indicating that KCR might inhibit cell proliferation through inducing differentiation-mediated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Mechanism investigation revealed that KCR treatment obviously increased phosphorylation levels of PKC\u03b4 and ERK1/2 as well as GATA1 expression. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that KCR induces megakaryocytic differentiation and suppresses leukemogenesis at least partly through activation of PKC\u03b4/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in erythroleukemia cells. KCR may also serve as a promising natural compound for human erythroleukemia treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..
