Global concerns regarding the increasing resistance of pathogens towards currently available antibiotics have encouraged researchers to find new drugs with antibacterial activity, particularly from plant sources.", "This study was aimed at exploring the broad-spectrum antibacterial potential of methanol extracts of species representing four genera of Combretaceae (Combretum, Pteleopsis, Quisqualis, Terminalia), indigenous to South Africa, using a biochemometric approach.", "The microdilution assay was used to determine the antibacterial activities, measured as minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), of the 51 methanol extracts representing 35 Combretaceae species, against nine species of pathogenic bacteria. Integrative biochemometric analysis was performed, thereby correlating the MIC values with the metabolomic data obtained from ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) analysis. Orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) models were constructed for six pathogens displaying variation in their susceptibility towards the extracts.", "Evaluation of the overall MIC values obtained indicated that extracts of species from the four genera displayed the highest activity towards Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778 (average MIC 0.52\u00a0mg/mL) and Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028 (average MIC 0.63\u00a0mg/mL). These bacteria were the most sensitive Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Extracts from Combretum acutifolium, Combretum imberbe and Combretum elaeagnoides were the most active, with average MIC values of 0.70\u00a0mg/mL, 0.52\u00a0mg/mL and 0.45\u00a0mg/mL, respectively. Five triterpenoid compounds were tentatively identified as biomarkers from the biochemometric analysis.", "Correlation of the phytochemistry of species from four genera in the Combretaceae family with antibacterial activity revealed that triterpenoids are responsible for the broad-spectrum antibacterial activity observed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
