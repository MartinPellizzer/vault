Regarding our data, the plant extract exhibited antioxidant and radical scavenging activities at different magnitudes of potency. In addition, this study was undertaken to assess whether methanol extract of S. brachyantha could increase the endogenous antioxidant enzymes in cells, and where such increased cellular defences could provide protection against oxidative cell injury. Pre treatment of rat heart cell lines with 100 microg/ml of plant extract for 24h significantly prevented cell damage and enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes induced by a treatment with xanthine/xanthine oxidase. Increased reactive oxygen species and cell apoptosis induced by xanthine/xanthine oxidase was dose-dependently prevented when cells were pre treated for 24h with plant extract. These results indicated that S. brachyantha could protect against cell injury via induction of the antioxidant enzyme defences. The extract of this plant might be valuable antioxidant natural sources and seemed to be applicable in both healthy medicine and food industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
