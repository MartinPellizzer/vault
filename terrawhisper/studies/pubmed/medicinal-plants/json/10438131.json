The beans (VB), high in protein, contain toxic substances that possibly can be destroyed by heating. Few data are available on the use of VB in poultry nutrition. We examined the effects of raw and dry-roasted VB on broiler performance in two experiments. In Experiment 1, 10, 20, and 30% raw VB were substituted into nutritionally balanced rations fed 0 to 42 d of age. Raw VB caused progressive reductions in growth; at 42 d of age, broilers fed 30% VB weighed 39% of controls. Feed intake declined significantly only with 30% VB. Feed efficiency decreased significantly with 20 and 30% VB. In Experiment 2, 10% raw VB and 10, 20, and 30% heated VB were fed 0 to 42 d. With 10% raw VB, broilers grew significantly slower but feed intake was unchanged. Inclusion of 10% heated VB allowed better growth than raw VB, and by 42 d of age, growth was not significantly different from that of controls. At 20 and 30%, heated VB promoted much better growth and efficiency than raw VB in Experiment 1, but values were significantly lower than those of controls. With 30% heated VB, broilers grew to 66% of control, a marked improvement over raw VB. Carcass yield was unaffected. Trypsin inhibitor activity but not L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in VB was destroyed by heating. We conclude that dry heating of VB partially destroys its growth-inhibiting factor(s), allowing successful use of 10% heated VB in broiler rations. Higher levels of heated VB reduced broiler performance, although results were much better than those of raw VB."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Zootecnia, Escuela Agricola Panamericana, Tegucigalpa, Honduras."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Del Carmen", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gernat", "ForeName": "A G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Myhrman", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carew", "ForeName": "L B", "Initials": "LB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Poult Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0401150", "ISSNLinking": "0032-5791"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Husbandry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10438131", "10.1093/ps/78.6.866", "S0032-5791(19)41017-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
