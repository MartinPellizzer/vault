They were evaluated against five phytopathogens fungi, namely Cytospora sp., Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Botrytis cinerea, Alternaria solani and Fusarium solani in vitro. Most of the above-mentioned compounds exhibited activities. For example, 4-chloro-2-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl)phenol (3k) and 4-bromo-3-phenol-1H-pyrazole (3b) showed good and broad-spectrum antifungal properties against Cytospora sp., C. gloeosporioides, Botrytis cinerea, Alternaria solani and F. Solani with [Formula: see text] values ranging from 4.66 to 12.47\u00a0[Formula: see text]g/mL. The results showed that pyrazoles with one aryl group at 3-position (2 and 3) exhibited better antibacterial activity than those with two aryl substituents (4). In addition, the existence of an electron-withdrawing group, a substituent on the ortho-position of phenol ring or a halogen atom at the 4-position of the pyrazole enhanced the antifungal activity of pyrazoles 2 and 3. A series of arylpyrazole derivatives was facilely prepared and was evaluated against five phytopathogens fungi including Cytospora sp., Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Botrytis cinerea, Alternaria solani, and Fusarium solani in vitro. Most of those compounds exhibited remarkable antifungal activities and were superior to the positive control hymexazol."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [],
