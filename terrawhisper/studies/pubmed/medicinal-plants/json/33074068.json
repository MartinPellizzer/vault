However, consecutive monoculture of R. pseudostellariae results in severe root rot and decline in biomass and quality of underground tubers. Root tubers of R. pseudostellariae are typically planted in December and harvested in next June. Root rot commonly starts developing in May. The disease incidence of root rot was ranging from 37 to 46% in root portions and basal stem of R. pseudostellariae under the consecutive monoculture fields in Shibing County, Guizhou Province, China (108\u00b012'E, 27\u00b003'N) (Li et al. 2017). Severe root rot was observed in Shibing County in May 2018. Infected plants displayed curly, withered, and yellow leaves, blight, retarded growth, root rot, and yield losses. Abundant whitish mycelia were observed on roots and surrounding soil. Two fungal isolates, designated GZ20190123 and GZ20190124, were obtained from symptomatic roots cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA). The optimum temperature range for growth of the two isolates was 25 to 30\u00b0C. The optimum pH range for the growth of GZ20190123 was 5 to 5.5, whereas GZ20190124 grew better between pH 5 to 8.5. The mean mycelial growth rates of GZ20190123 and GZ20190124 at 30\u00b0C were 2.1 and 1.5 cm/day, respectively. Conidia of the two isolates were ovoid or obclavate and were produced in single or branched chains. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was amplified with primers ITS1 and ITS4 (White et al. 1990). The sequences were deposited in GenBank as accession No. MN726736 for GZ20190123 and MN726738 for GZ20190124. Sequence comparison revealed 99% (GZ20190123) and 97% (GZ20190124) identity with previously reported isolate xsd08071 of Mucor racemosus Bull. (accession No. FJ582639.1) and isolate BM3 of Mucor fragilis Bainier (accession No. MK910058.1), respectively, which was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. The two isolates were tested for pathogenicity on R. pseudostellariae. Six roots of R. pseudostellariae were surface-sterilized with 75% ethanol and stab inoculated with mycelia using a sterile toothpick for each isolate. Sterile distilled water was stab inoculated to twelve roots to serve as the control. Treated roots were incubated in a greenhouse with 16 h day length [light intensity 146.5 \u03bcmol/(m2\u00b7s)] and day/night temperature 26\u00b0C/18\u00b0C. The inoculated roots showed the expected symptoms on roots and sprouts 7 days after inoculation, whereas the control roots with sprouts did not show any symptom. The fungi were re-isolated from the diseased roots and confirmed as expected M. racemosus or M. fragilis based on the ITS sequences, which satisfied Koch's postulates. Thus, isolate GZ20190123 was identified as M. racemosus and GZ20190124 as M. fragilis. Previously, M. racemosus and M. fragilis have been reported as a pathogen on tomato (Kwon and Hong 2005) and grape (Ghuffar et al. 2018), respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of M. racemosus and M. fragilis causing root rot of R. pseudostellariae in southwestern China, where the disease could cause a significant loss to production of this important medicinal plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, 12449, College of Life Sciences, Fuzhou, China; wuhongmiao2010@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Hongmiao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, 12449, College of Life Sciences, Fuzhou, China; 876274627@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jiachun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, 12449, College of Life Sciences, Fuzhou, China; 1249361313@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, 12449, College of Life Sciences, Fuzhou, China; ththt2008@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, 12449, College of Life Sciences, Fuzhou, China; 949238733@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Jingkai", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, No. 15, Shangxiadian Road, Fuzhou, Fujian, China, 350002; lwx@fafu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Wenxiong", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["33074068", "10.1094/PDIS-07-20-1634-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
