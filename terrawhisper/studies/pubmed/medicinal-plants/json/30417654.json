Their structures were established by analysis of mass and NMR data, as well as comparison with previous published data in the literatures. Among them, ten compounds were found from the <i>Hyssopus</i> genus for the first time, and one compound was isolated from <i>H. cuspidatus</i> for the first time. HPLC-DAD-ESI-HRMS/MS investigations was applied to further obtain the phenolic profiling of the ethyl acetate fraction, and nine derivatives of caffeic acid and ferulic or isoferulic acid were identified. Antioxidant activity against DPPH free radical and antibacterial activity against <i>Candida albicans</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> were evaluated. The ethyl acetate fraction exhibited weak antioxidant activity and moderate antibacterial activity. The isolated compounds showed weak to potent antioxidant and antibacterial activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the antioxidant and antibacterial activity of <i>H. cuspidatus</i>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone and State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, P.
