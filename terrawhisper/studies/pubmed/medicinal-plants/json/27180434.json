Traditional accounts of indigenous plant Jatopha gossypyfolia suggest presence of important medicinal activities including improvement of memory functioning. To establish correlation of its use as anti-Alzheimer, AChE and BuChE inhibitory activity of extracts obtained from different parts of plant Jatropha gossypyfolia belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae were tested. Extracts from leaves, stem bark and roots were prepared by maceration. Enzyme inhibitory activity was carried out by using standard in vitro AChE and BuChE inhibition assays (Ellman's assay method) and the percentage inhibition was calculated. The results showed that roots dichloromethane fraction (65.43 \u00b1 0.11), roots methanol fraction (62.79 \u00b1 0.34) and leaves dichloromethane fraction (57.71 \u00b1 0.15) showed significant acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity compared to other fractions when compared with standard serine (91.29 \u00b1 1.17). Similarly, butyrylcholinesterase enzyme inhibitory results showed that roots dichloromethane fraction (80.46 \u00b1 0.44), JGLE (77.34 \u00b1 0.34) showed significant BuChE enzyme inhibitory activity as compared to other fractions when compared with standard eserine (82.82 \u00b1 1.09). Dichloromethane extracts showed higher enzyme inhibition comparatively. Highest AChE and BuChE inhibition was observed with leaf extracts of ethyl acetate fraction. In conclusion, the plant extracts exhibited presence of bioactive compounds with significant AChE and BuChE inhibition supporting traditional use of this herb in the management of AD. However, further investigation of the plant is required."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (IPS), University of Veterinary & Animal Sciences, Lahore; Department of Pharmacy, Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Saleem", "ForeName": "Hammad", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Irshad", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shahid", "ForeName": "Muhammad Nabeel", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gill", "ForeName": "Muhammad Shoaib Ali", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nadeem", "ForeName": "Muhammad Faisal", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mahmood", "ForeName": "Waqas", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rashid", "ForeName": "Imran", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pol Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "2985167R", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6837"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.8", "NameOfSubstance": "Butyrylcholinesterase"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Acta Pol Pharm. 2016 May-Jun;73(3):808"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Butyrylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Jatropha"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Bark"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27180434"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
