Consumption of high-fiber and nutrient-rich foods including vegetables have been shown to reduce risks of obesity and Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Also, many herbal plants have been associated with reduced risks of T2DM because of their composition of secondary metabolites. Antioxidant activities of some secondary metabolites have potent inhibitory effects against inflammation linked with insulin resistance and oxidative stress. More than 800 known medicinal plants are used to control diabetes and its relevant complications. However, variations in preharvest factors including plant genotype, growing medium properties, climatic factors, and management practices can influence plant growth and their accumulation of phytochemicals with health-promoting properties. However, the effects of these preharvest factors on the antidiabetic properties of plant secondary metabolites are neither explicit nor easily accessible in the literature. Therefore, this review aims to document recent studies that reported on under-exploited medicinal plants with antidiabetic properties. We reviewed several important preharvest factors that can potentially affect the synthesis of phytoconstituents which possess antidiabetic properties. This review will help identify gaps for future research in phytomedicine and functional foods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8151-9570"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dalhousie University, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Plant, Food, Environmental Sciences, Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada."}], "LastName": "Saleh", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2219-1752"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dalhousie University, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Plant, Food, Environmental Sciences, Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada."}], "LastName": "Abbey", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0964-6890"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dalhousie University, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Plant, Food, Environmental Sciences, Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada."}], "LastName": "Ofoe", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "McGill University, Department of Bioresource Engineering, Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, Canada."}], "LastName": "Ampofo", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1826-6646"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dalhousie University, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Plant, Food, Environmental Sciences, Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada."}], "LastName": "Gunupuru", "ForeName": "L R", "Initials": "LR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101129542", "ISSNLinking": "1519-6984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "34"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36722681", "10.1590/1519-6984.269583", "S1519-69842024000100427"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
