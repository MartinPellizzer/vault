Regulating the expression of genes through epigenetics, especially regulation through methylation, is one of the key aspects of regulating gene expression and the function of genes, which is also regulated by the pathways regulating the pathway of apoptosis. The epigenetic regulatory phenomenon in cancer cells can undergo a change in regulation and induces resistance to apoptosis against chemotherapy and anticancer factors.
