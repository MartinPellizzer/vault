The cultures were cultivated under constant illumination (3500 lux) and in the dark. The growth of the culture in the dark was not affected by the precursors, cinnamic acid in a concentration of 1 mmol/l exerted toxic action. The growth of the culture cultivated under constant illumination was stimulated by tyrosine in a concentration of 0.1 and 1 mmol/l, and phenylalanine in a concentration of 0.1 mmol/l; phenylalanine and cinnamic acid in a concentration of 1 mmol/l inhibited the growth of the culture. In the cultivation in the dark, coumarin production was increased by phenylalanine in a concentration 0.01 mmol/l and by tyrosine in a concentration of 1 mmol/l. In the cultivation under constant illumination, coumarin production was decreased by the action of cinnamic acid, was not affected by tyrosine, and phenylalanine (0.01 and 0.1 mmol/l) increased it in comparison with the culture without precursors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Katedra farmakognozie Farmaceutick\u00e9 fakulty Univerzity Karlovy, Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9. siatka@faf.cuni.cz"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Siatka", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kasparov\u00e1", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Vliv prekurzor\u016f na produkci kumarin\u016f v suspenzn\u00ed kulture Angelica archangelica L."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Czech Republic", "MedlineTA": "Ceska Slov Farm", "NlmUniqueID": "9433765", "ISSNLinking": "1210-7816"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cinnamates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "140-10-3", "NameOfSubstance": "cinnamic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42HK56048U", "NameOfSubstance": "Tyrosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "47E5O17Y3R", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylalanine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Angelica archangelica"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylalanine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tyrosine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11910743"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
