Newer antidepressants were more effective than placebo for major depression (relative benefit, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.5 to 1.7]) and dysthymia (relative benefit, 1.7 [CI, 1.3 to 2.3]). They were effective among older adults and primary care patients. Efficacy did not differ among newer agents or between newer and older agents. Hypericum (St. John's wort) was more effective than placebo for mild to moderate depression (risk ratio, 1.9 [CI, 1.2 to 2.8]), but publication bias may have inflated the estimate of benefit. Newer and older antidepressants did not differ for overall discontinuation rates, but side effect profiles varied significantly. Data were insufficient for determining the efficacy of newer antidepressants for subsyndromal depression, depression with coexisting medical or psychiatric illness, or depression in adolescents.", "Newer antidepressants are clearly effective in treating depressive disorders in diverse settings. Because of similar efficacy, both newer and older antidepressants should be considered when making treatment decisions. Better information is urgently needed on the efficacy of newer antidepressants in patients with nonmajor depression and in special populations, including adolescents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South Texas Veterans Health Care System, Audie Murphy Division and the San Antonio Evidence-based Practice Center, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, 78229-3900, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mulrow", "ForeName": "C D", "Initials": "CD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiquette", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "No\u00ebl", "ForeName": "P H", "Initials": "PH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aguilar", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cornell", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "290-97-0012", "Agency": "PHS HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Intern Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0372351", "ISSNLinking": "0003-4819"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depressive Disorder"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphatic Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patient Dropouts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Practice Guidelines as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thymus Gland"}], "NumberOfReferences": "116"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10787370", "10.7326/0003-4819-132-9-200005020-00011", "200005020-00011"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
