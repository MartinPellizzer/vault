The aim of our work was to study the association between the regular use of medicinal plants and the risk of chronic renal failure in hospitalized patients in four departments of Mohammed VI University Hospital.", "A case-control study was performed from January 2018 to December 2018. The cases were patients with a first-time diagnosis of chronic renal failure and without family history of kidney diseases or pre-existing renal disease. One control was matched to each case for age, gender, date of entry, and history of hypertension or diabetes.", "208 patients were recruited. Among 104 cases, 42 patients (40.4%) regularly used medicinal plants compared to 18.3% in the group of controls (OR: 1.3; 95% CI; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the regular use of medicinal plants was significantly associated with the risk of chronic renal failure (OR: 3.05; 95% CI; p\u00a0<\u00a00,001). Also a total of 52 plant species representing 29 plant families were reported in our study. Dominant plant families were represented by the Lamiaceae followed by the Apiaceae.", "Regular use of medicinal plants increases the risk of chronic kidney failure. Therefore, we need active measures to regulate this sector."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Naouaoui", "ForeName": "Salma", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fadili", "ForeName": "Wafaa", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chettati", "ForeName": "Mariam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Laouad", "ForeName": "Inass", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Clin Nephrol", "NlmUniqueID": "0364441", "ISSNLinking": "0301-0430"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Failure, Chronic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32716290", "10.5414/CN110105", "186878"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
