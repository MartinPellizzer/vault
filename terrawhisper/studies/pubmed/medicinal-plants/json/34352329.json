Yet it is noteworthy that QHZG has therapeutic effect on recurrent respiratory tract infection (RRTI) in children. However, its potential molecular mechanisms remained unclear.", "The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effect and potential mechanism of QHZG on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced acute spleen injury.", "The acute spleen injury model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of LPS (10\u00a0mg/kg) and safe doses of QHZG was administered by gavage once a day for 23 days before LPS treatment. Serum inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were tested by ELISA. Related protein levels were detected by Western blotting. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was employed to observe the histological alterations. The distribution of macrophages and neutrophils in the mouse spleen was examined by immunofluorescence analysis.", "QHZG pretreatment significantly abolished the increased secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which were attributable to LPS treatment. Immunofluorescence staining and Histological analysis of spleen tissue revealed the protective effect of QHZG against LPS-induced acute spleen injury in mice. Further study indicated that pretreatment with QHZG significantly inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of Src. Accordingly, the increased phosphorylation of Src downstream components (JNK, ERK, P38 and STAT3) induced by LPS was remarkably diminished by QHZG, suggesting the involvement of Src/MAPK/STAT3 pathway in the inhibitory effects of QHZG on spleen injury in mice.", "Our study demonstrated that QHZG protected mice from LPS-induced acute spleen injury via inhibition of Src/MAPK/Stat3 signal pathway. These results suggested that QHZG might serve as a new drug for the treatment of LPS-stimulated spleen injury."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
