The study subjects consisted of 25 patients who were diagnosed as having hypochromic mild to moderate anemia associated with menorrhagia attributable to uterine myoma. They were divided into the Toki-shakuyaku-san group (n = 10) and the oral iron group (n = 15). We monitored the blood counts, subjective symptoms, and occurrence of side effects after oral administration of either preparation for 4 and 8 weeks in these subjects. In regard to the blood counts and improvements of the laboratory parameters of anemia, while marked improvement was observed in the oral iron group, no significant improvement was noted in the Toki-shakuyaku-san group. On the other hand, in terms of improvement of the signs and symptoms of anemia, such as facial pallor, spoon-shaped nails and dizziness, the latter group also showed significant improvement. In addition in the Toki-shakuyaku-san group, resolution of symptoms such as hypermenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, feeling cold, dizziness, headache and shoulder stiffness was also noted. While side effects were encountered in 80.0% of patients in the oral iron group, no significant side effects were observed in the Toki-shakuyaku-san group. From these findings, it is considered that Toki-shakuyaku-san may be useful for resolving the symptoms of mild or moderate anemia associated with uterine myoma."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Biomedical Sciences, Showa Pharmaceutical University, 3-3165 Higashi-Tamagawa-Gakuen, Machida, Tokyo 194-8543, Japan. akase@ac.shoyaku.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akase", "ForeName": "Tomoko", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akase", "ForeName": "Tomohide", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Onodera", "ForeName": "Satoshi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jobo", "ForeName": "Toshiko", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsushita", "ForeName": "Ryo", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaneko", "ForeName": "Masakazu", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tashiro", "ForeName": "Shin-ichi", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "toki-shakuyaku-san"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Anemia, Hypochromic"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Leiomyoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Severity of Illness Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Uterine Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14513774", "10.1248/yakushi.123.817"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
