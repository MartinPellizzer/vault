The effects of elicitor dosage, exposures time, and age of subculture on ajmalicine accumulation were studied. A higher concentration of elicitor extract responded positively to C. roseus suspension cultures. Ajmalicine accumulation increased by about 3-fold when cells were treated with A. niger, F.moniliforme, and T. viride. The maximum ajmalicine production (75 microg g(-1) dry weight (DW)) was observed in cells treated with T. viride. Cell cultures were elicited with 5% preparation of A. niger, F. moniliforme, and T. viride and exposed for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. for elicitation. Suspension cultures elicited with T. viride for 48 h showed a 3-fold increase (87 microg g(-1) DW) in ajmalicine contents, whereas A. niger and F. moniliforme synthesized a 2-fold increase in alkaloid and yielded 52 and 56 microg g(-1) DW ajmalicine, respectively. C. roseus cells of different age (5,10, 15, 20, and 25 days old) were treated with a 5% elicitor of A. niger, F. moniliforme, and T. viride and investigated elicitors activity at different age of cell cultures. Maximum yield 166 microg g(-1) DW of ajmalicine was synthesized in 20 day old suspension cultures treated with T. viride. A longer period of incubation of cell cultures with elicitors adversely affected the ajmalicine synthesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharma-Biotech Division, Kabra Drugs Ltd., 26, Sector A, Sanwer Road, Indore 421 305, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Namdeo", "ForeName": "Ajay", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Patil", "ForeName": "Shridhar", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fulzele", "ForeName": "Devanand P", "Initials": "DP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Prog", "NlmUniqueID": "8506292", "ISSNLinking": "1520-6033"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cell Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2Y49VWD90Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Yohimbine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4QJL8OX71Z", "NameOfSubstance": "raubasine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catharanthus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Yohimbine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11822914", "10.1021/bp0101280", "bp0101280"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
