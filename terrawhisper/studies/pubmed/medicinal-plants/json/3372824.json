Total mixed diets contained (dry basis) 51% concentrate mix, 33% corn silage, and 16% alfalfa hay. Concentrate mixes contained 0, 50, and 100% chickpeas in place of corn and soybean meal. Ad libitum intakes of DM were not different between diets. Digestibilities of DM, NDF, ADF, hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, and gross energy were not different among diets. Digestibilities of protein, fat, and ash were greater for steers fed 100% chickpeas than 0% chickpeas. Fecal N was lower and absorbed N was higher for steers fed 100% chickpeas. Ruminal acetate and acetate:propionate ratio were lower and ruminal propionate was higher for all steers fed diets containing chickpeas. Ruminal ammonia and pH were similar for all treatments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dairy Science Department, South Dakota State University, Brookings 57007-0647."}], "LastName": "Sommerfeldt", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lyon", "ForeName": "K A", "Initials": "KA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Dairy Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "2985126R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Rumen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3372824", "10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(88)79625-3", "S0022-0302(88)79625-3"]}}]}
