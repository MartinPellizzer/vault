However, there is limited data on the impact of plant species, especially those that produce aromas, on bioaerosol composition at agricultural sites. Hence, the aim of this study is to evaluate the variability in bacterial communities present in bioaerosol samples collected from agricultural sites with aroma-producing crops. For this, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10,</sub> and bioaerosol samples were collected from agricultural fields growing Ocimum [two varieties of O. sanctum (CIM-Aayu and CIM-Angana)] and O. kilimandscharicum (Kapoor), nearby traffic junctions and suburban areas. PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations at the agricultural site were in between the other two polluted sites. However, bioaerosol concentration was lower at agricultural sites than at other sites. The culturable bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus tequilensis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus were more prevalent in agricultural sites than in other areas. However, the composition of non-culturable bacteria varied between sites and differed in three fields where Ocimum was cultivated. The CIM-Aayu cultivated area showed a high bacterial richness, lower Simpson and Shannon indices, and a distinctive metabolic profile. The sites CIM-Angana and CIM-Kapoor had a higher abundance of Aeromonas, while Pantoea and Pseudomonas were present at CIM-Aayu. Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus, and Bacillus were the dominant genera at the other two sites. Metabolic profiling showed that the CIM-Aayu site had a higher prevalence of pathways related to amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism and environmental information processing compared to other sites. The composition of bioaerosol among the three different Ocimum sites could be due to variations in the plant volatile and cross-feeding nature of bacterial isolates, which further needs to be explored."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
