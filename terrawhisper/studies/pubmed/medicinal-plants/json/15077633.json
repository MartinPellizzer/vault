Ohwi is a medicinal plant producing large amounts of isoflavonoid glycosides. Here, the ability of in vitro callus cultures to synthesize isoflavonoids was tested. Callus cultures have been initiated from different explants of in vitro germinated plants using modified MS medium. Roots, leaves and stem segments were the best sources of callus tissue. The isoflavonoid profile and content was determined by means of chromatographic methods. Callus from all organs contained isoflavonoid aglycones: genistein and daidzein and daidzein glycosides: daidzin, puerarin and 3'-methoxypuerarin. The differences between each kind of explant were observed in both the total amount of isoflavonoids and in the proportion of individual compounds. The highest content was in root callus, followed by leaf- and stem callus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biology and Botany, Medical University in Wroc\u0142aw, Al.
