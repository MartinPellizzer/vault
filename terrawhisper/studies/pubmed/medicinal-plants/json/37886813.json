Due to their abilities to promote plant development and manage diseases, bacterial endophytes provide a more promising approach for treating this vascular disease.", "This work was undertaken for the selection and identification of promising isolates as plant growth promoters and biocontrol agents against F. verticillioides in maize agroecosystems. A screening procedure consisting of in vitro and in situ tests was applied to 27 endophytic strains originating from desert plants: Euphorbia antiquorum, Calotropis procera, and Alcasia albida. In vitro studies indicated that the bacteria exhibited variable results in biocontrol, endophytism, and plant growth-promoting traits. In addition, in situ plant growth promotion and biocontrol experiments allowed the identification of the most promising bacterial endophytes. In vitro and in situ comparative study results indicated a low correlation. Our data revealed that in situ screening must be used as the method of selection of biocontrol agents against Fusarium ear and root rot disease. Based on in situ results, seven potent strains were selected and identified as Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus velezensis, Bacillus tequilensis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.", "The results of this study showed that the selected strains seem to be promising candidates to be exploited as biofertilizers and biocontrol agents against Fusarium maize ear and root rot disease. \u00a9 2023 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8896-2965"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Antimicrobial & Biocontrol Agents Unit (AmBcAU), Laboratory for Phytobiochemistry and Medicinal Plants Studies, Department of Biochemistry, University of Yaound\u00e9 I, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Dinango", "ForeName": "Vanessa Nya", "Initials": "VN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biopesticides, Centre of Biotechnology of Sfax, Sfax University, Sfax, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Dhouib", "ForeName": "Hanen", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Antimicrobial & Biocontrol Agents Unit (AmBcAU), Laboratory for Phytobiochemistry and Medicinal Plants Studies, Department of Biochemistry, University of Yaound\u00e9 I, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Soil Microbiology Laboratory, Biotechnology Centre, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Wakam", "ForeName": "Louise Nana", "Initials": "LN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Antimicrobial & Biocontrol Agents Unit (AmBcAU), Laboratory for Phytobiochemistry and Medicinal Plants Studies, Department of Biochemistry, University of Yaound\u00e9 I, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Kouokap", "ForeName": "Lanvin Kepngop", "Initials": "LK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Antimicrobial & Biocontrol Agents Unit (AmBcAU), Laboratory for Phytobiochemistry and Medicinal Plants Studies, Department of Biochemistry, University of Yaound\u00e9 I, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Youmbi", "ForeName": "Diane Yimta", "Initials": "DY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Technology, Department of Crop Production Technology, University of Bamenda, Bambili, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Eke", "ForeName": "Pierre", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biopesticides, Centre of Biotechnology of Sfax, Sfax University, Sfax, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Driss", "ForeName": "Fatma", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1545-0122"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biopesticides, Centre of Biotechnology of Sfax, Sfax University, Sfax, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Tounsi", "ForeName": "Slim", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Antimicrobial & Biocontrol Agents Unit (AmBcAU), Laboratory for Phytobiochemistry and Medicinal Plants Studies, Department of Biochemistry, University of Yaound\u00e9 I, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Boyom", "ForeName": "Fabrice Fekam", "Initials": "FF"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2391-8135"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biopesticides, Centre of Biotechnology of Sfax, Sfax University, Sfax, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Frikha-Gargouri", "ForeName": "Olfa", "Initials": "O"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "Minist\u00e8re de l'Enseignement Sup\u00e9rieur et de la Recherche Scientifique", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pest Manag Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "100898744", "ISSNLinking": "1526-498X"}, "SupplMeshList": ["Fusarium verticillioides"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fusarium"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Khan NU, Sheteiwy M, Lihua N, Khan MMU and Han Z, An update on the maize zein-gene family in the post-genomics era.
