TJ403-B1 resulted in the identification of 12 ophiobolin-type phytotoxins (<b>1</b>-<b>12</b>), including nine new ones, termed bipolaricins A-I (<b>1</b>-<b>9</b>). The structures of <b>1</b>-<b>9</b> were elucidated via spectroscopic data (including HRESIMS and 1D and 2D NMR) and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Cu K\u03b1) analyses. All of the isolated compounds were tested in terms of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory, anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxic activities. Compound <b>10</b> showed HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 8.4 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcM), and <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>10</b>-<b>12</b> showed significant inhibitory potency against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide production, with IC<sub>50</sub> values in the range of 5.1 \u00b1 0.3 to 20 \u00b1 1 \u03bcM. Further experiments showed that <b>10</b> could significantly inhibit the production of IL-1\u03b2, RANTES, MIP-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 as well as enhance the release of IL-13 in macrophages through the inhibition of HO-1 induction as well as the NF-\u03baB pathway. These findings provide a scientific rationale for an anti-inflammatory therapeutic and a template for a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor to produce a potential anti-hyperlipidemia agent."]},
