Several drugs derived from diterpenoid alkaloids are widely used to the current clinical treatment of pain, inflammation, and other symptoms. This paper aims to clarify the main metabolites and distribution of diterpenoid alkaloids in different parts of Aconitum plants. To that end, 7 species of Aconitum from three subgenera were analyzed by UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS under identical conditions. The fragmentation regularity of various types of diterpene alkaloids were determined and a total of 126 metabolites were identified by comparing the reference material and secondary mass spectrometry, with the literature. 67, 49, 17, 41, 14, 17 and 21 metabolites were identified from Aconitum carmichaeli, Aconitum stylosum, Aconitum sinomontanum, Aconitum vilmorinianum, Aconitum pendulum, Aconitum tanguticum and Aconitum gymnandrum, respectively. Meanwhile, the structure type of A. carmichaeli, A. stylosum, A. vilmorinianum, A. pendulum, A. gymnandrum were identified as C<sub>19</sub> type, A. sinomontanum was C<sub>18</sub> type, while A. tanguticum was C<sub>20</sub> type. A high similarity of metabolites was found between A. stylosum and A. vilmorinianum. The quantitative analysis of 19 compounds and the relative peak area of all metabolites which obtained through internal standard berberine, highlighted compounds like karakoline, talatisamine and atisine as references for future study of metabolic pathways. Furthermore, results from metabolites distribution and relative peak area analysis suggest that the leaf of A. carmichaeli, the leaf and stem of A. stylosum and A. vilmorinianum, and the flower of A. pendulum have potential as medicinal resources and are worth further development. These results establish a foundation for the comprehensive utilization of Aconitum resources."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
