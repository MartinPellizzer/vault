P. kingianum is widely planted in the Southwestern China. In September 2023, we observed a leaf spot of P. kingianum with disease incidence of 100%, and disease index reached 60 in commercial plantings in Kunming, Yunnan province, China (24.3610\u00b0N, 102.3740\u00b0E). In the initial stage of infection, symptoms manifested as a small circular brown spot. As the spots gradually expanded, they formed oval to irregular shaped lesions with grayish-white or dark-brown borders. Progressively the entire leaf withered and died. For identification of the causal agent of the leaf spot, leaf sections (5\u00d75 mm2) were cut from the margin of the lesion and soaked in 75% ethanol for 10 s, 1% sodium hypochlorite for 3 min, washed with sterile distilled water, dried on sterilized tissue paper and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA). The Petri dishes were then incubated at 28\u2103 for 3 days with a 12-h photoperiod. A predominant fungus was isolated from 95% of the samples. Three monosporic isolates were screened using a single-spore isolation method. After 4 days of incubation the colonies were white, after 7 days turned yellow-white. Conidia were black-brown, oblong or fusiform, with 3-7 transverse septa and 0-3 longitudinal septa, with dimensions of 19.5 to 49.5 \u00d7 8.7 to 17.6 \u00b5m (n = 30). Total genomic DNA of these three isolates was extracted from mycelia by the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) protocol. The nucleotide sequences of the elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1\u03b1), nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS), 28S nuclear ribosomal large subunit rRNA gene (LSU), 18S nuclear ribosomal small subunit rRNA gene (SSU), and the second largest subunit of nuclear DNA-directed RNA polymerase II (RPB2) gene regions were amplified using the primer pairs EF1-728F/EF1-986R (Carbone and Kohn 1999), ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), LR0R/LR5 (Schoch et al. 2012), NS1/NS4 (Schoch et al. 2012), and fRPB2-5F/fRPB2-7Cr (Liu et al. 1999), respectively. Amplicons were cloned in a pMDTM19-T vector (code no. 6013, Takara, Kusatsu, Japan) and bidirectionally sequenced. All three isolates had identical nucleotide sequences. Sequences from one isolate (PkF03) were deposited in GenBank. BLASTn analyses showed that sequences of EF1\u03b1 (GenBank accession no. PP695240), ITS (PP694046), LSU (PP683406), SSU (PP683407), and RPB2 (PP695241) of isolate PkF03 were 99.6 (KP125134), 100 (KP124358), 100 (KP124510), 99.9 (KP124980), and 100% (KP124826), respectively, identical with Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissl. strain CBS 118815. Based on the nucleotide sequences of EF1\u03b1, ITS, LSU, SSU, and RPB2, a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGAX with Tamura-Nei model. Isolate PkF03 was grouped in the same clade as A. alternata. According to the morphology and sequence analyses isolate PkF03 was identified as A. alternata (Woudenberg et al. 2013). To determine pathogenicity of isolate PkF03, a spore suspension (106 spores/mL) was sprayed on 1-year-old healthy leaves of P. kingianum. The control leaves were sprayed with sterile water. All plants were incubated at 28\u2103, 70% relative humidity, and a 12-h photoperiod. The pathogenicity tests were repeated three times with six plants in each treatment. Fifteen days post-inoculation, the inoculated leaves showed brown-yellow lesions, whereas the control leaves remained symptomless. A. alternata was reisolated from infected leaves. To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. alternata causing leaf spot on P. kingianum in Kunming, China. The results provide a scientific basis for prevention and control of the disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kunming, China; 1483874909@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Jingying", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming, Yunnan, China; 1932874679@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Weilu", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming, Yunnan, China; 1019397265@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jingyi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming, Yunnan, China; 3238887224@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yimeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming, Yunnan, China; dongxian_1655129@163.com."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Xian", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming, Yunnan, China; 466192110@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Pengzhang", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica and Yunnan Key Laboratory of Southern Medicinal Resource, No.1076# Yuhua Road, Chenggong New District Kunming, Kunming, Yunnan, China, 650500."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China; dongjhn@126.com."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Jiahong", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Menglunkunming, China, 666303; 84144784@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Chai", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chenggong, Yuhua road No. 1076, Kunming, Yunnan, China, 650500; zhlei318@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39021153", "10.1094/PDIS-05-24-0973-PDN"]}}]}
