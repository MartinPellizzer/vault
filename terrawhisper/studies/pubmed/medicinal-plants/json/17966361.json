Each group had 8 rats. Hyperlipemic rat model was made firstly, the blood was obtained via vena caudalis and the indexes of TC, TG, LDL, HDL and NEFA in the serum were measured. The myocardial total RNA was extracted by Trizol method. To compare the expression of connexin43 in the following groups: hyperlipemia, normal and drug, we used the technique of RT-PCR, immunostaining and microconfoul.", "The concentrations of TC, TG, LDL and NEFA in hyperlipemic serum were increased (P <0. 05), while that of HDL was decreased (P <0. 05). After treating with Daming capsule, the concentration of the preceding four indexes were decreased and the concentrations of HDL was increased up to nearly normal level. No significant difference was found in the ECG of the three groups. As compared with the normal group, the mRNA expressions of connexin43 in hyperlipemia group was weakened (P <0.05), while that of the drug group was enhanced(P <0.05). The same result in immunostaining was observed.", "Hyperlipemic rat model was successfully established and Daming capsule has the effect of lowering blood lipid.
