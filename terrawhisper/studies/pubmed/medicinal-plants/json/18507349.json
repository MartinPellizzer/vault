The study was carried out with model drugs as the alcohol extracted liquid for Radix et Rhizoma Rhei (AELRR) by HPLC under the chromatographic conditions that the column was C18, 4.6 mm x 250 mm, 5 microm; the detection of wavelengths was set at 254 nm; a solution of acetonitrile: 1% acetic acid water (from 0:100 to 100:0) was carried with gradient elution as the mobile phase; the ratio of flow was 1 mL min(-1); the temperature was 40 degrees C. The coefficients were dealt with Excel document. It has been established the expressions that consists of four main parameters: 1) total quantum zero moment as AUC(T), area under curve; 2) total quantum respondent ratio as AUCPW(T), area under curve per weight; 3) total quantum center moment as MCRT(T), mean chromatographic retention time of total quantum, expressed by lambda(T); 4) total quantum variance as VCRT(T), variance of mean chromatographic retention time of total quantum, expressed by sigma2(T), by which we have obtained. The TQSM's parameters of the AELRR, such as AUC(T) as 3.273 x 10(8) microV s, AUCPW(T) as 2.286 x 10(6) microV s mg (-1), MCRT(T) as 33.50 min, VCRT(T) as 484.4 min2, and total quantum concentration as 143.2 mg mL(-1). The total quantum statistic moment can be characterized the curve of chromatographic fingerprints with expressive parameters above, also used to quantitative analyses by AUC(T), to qualitative analyses by AUCPW(T), MCR(T), and VCRT(T)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Hunan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410208, China. pharmsharking@tom.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Fu-Yuan", "Initials": "FY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Hong-Hao", "Initials": "HH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Kai-Wen", "Initials": "KW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Weng-Long", "Initials": "WL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ping-An", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthraquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "C8IYT9CR7C", "NameOfSubstance": "aloe emodin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H6PT94IV61", "NameOfSubstance": "physcione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KA46RNI6HN", "NameOfSubstance": "Emodin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YM64C2P6UX", "NameOfSubstance": "rhein"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Anthraquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Emodin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantum Theory"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rheum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18507349"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
