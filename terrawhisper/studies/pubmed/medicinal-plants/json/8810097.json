The diethyl ether extract (125 and 62.5 mg kg-1 body weight) was administered in a single doses, 7 and 14 days after provocation of lesions. Our results demonstrated that both doses significantly decreased the macro and microscopic ulcer index. Usually after 14-days treatment the lesions were found completely covered with regenerative epithelium and also an important proliferation of blood vessels was observed. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was assayed and used as an index of leucocyte infiltration. Application of acetic acid produced a significant increase of this activity 7 days after induction of chronic injury. Administration of 125 mg kg-1 of the ether extract provoked a sharp reduction on the enzymatic activity at the same period. After 14 days, this decrease was higher with both doses (p < 0.001). In addition, the macroscopic examination showed a drastic reduction of leucocyte infiltration in treated groups. These results suggest that the recovery of vascularization of the ulcerated area and the decrease of neutrophil infiltration are involved in the antiulcerogenic effect of the flavonoid fraction of Bidens aurea."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratorio de Farmacolog\u00eda, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad de Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a."}], "LastName": "Mart\u00edn Calero", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "La Casa", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Motilva", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "L\u00f3pez", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alarc\u00f3n de la Lastra", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Z Naturforsch C J Biosci", "NlmUniqueID": "8912155", "ISSNLinking": "0341-0382"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Neovascularization, Pathologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regeneration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8810097"]}}]}
