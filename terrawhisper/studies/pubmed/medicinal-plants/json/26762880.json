Panax ginseng is the most commonly used medicinal plant in Asian countries. The fix number of growth-year is an important quality evaluation which is difficult to be obtained accurately in current technical conditions. Preliminary authentication theory for growth-year has been described in previous studies using a short-lived perennial medicinal plant (Paeonia lactiflora pall.) as the research material. In this research, we focused on the growth-year estimation in ginseng cultivars, and attempt to explore the age estimation method for vascular plants according to mathematical simulation of the root structure development. Micro data was obtained from 204 individuals of 3 different kinds of ginseng cultivars, which have a series of gradient age and a clear growth record. Outer diameter of the vascular cambium (b) and the radius of cross section (r) were measured with ordinary stereo microscope. We further designed and established two different kinds of authentication model based on the taproot structure development for growth year authentication (P =\u03b2*M-\u03b1 and M\u2009=\u2009K*X1 (a) (1) X2 (a) (2) ). Moreover, the models were applied to identify the growth year of ginseng without damage using Micro-CT or DEI reconstruction. A potential method, have been recently described, the age of ginseng can be analyzed by telomere length and telomerase activity. However, we found that there are different results indicated in other species. We concluded that microscopic methods perceived currently were provided a more effective means for growth-year authentication."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine (Macau University of Science and Technology), Faculty of Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Avenida Wai Long Taipa, 000853, Macau."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Dao-Di Herbs, National Resource Center of Chinese Material Medical, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100700, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Chunsong", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of High Energy Physics Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Qingxi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine (Macau University of Science and Technology), Faculty of Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Avenida Wai Long Taipa, 000853, Macau."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Dao-Di Herbs, National Resource Center of Chinese Material Medical, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100700, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Luqi", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Microsc Res Tech", "NlmUniqueID": "9203012", "ISSNLinking": "1059-910X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26762880", "10.1002/jemt.22610"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
