Therefore, at ordinary levels of staining these substances depress the natural tendency of these dyes to change color. However, at elevated levels of dye-binding metachromasy eventually occurs. This phenomenon is explained on the basis of the distribution of dye-binding sites. In these substrates, by contrast with chromotropic substances, many binding sites are too far removed for dye interaction, consequently the interaction frequency can become high enough to produce a color change only as saturation of the available sites is approached. It is also shown that the destruction of color is a characteristic of metachromasy and that water molecules intercalated between approximated dye ions are responsible for the loss and change of color. A concept of metachromasy is proposed in which the interaction between water molecules and suitably approximated dye ions plays an essential role. The experimental studies are described against a background of the history and evolution of ideas on metachromasy. The literature is reviewed and reassessed particularly from the physicochemical viewpoint."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "BERGERON", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "SINGER", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biophys Biochem Cytol", "NlmUniqueID": "17840020R", "ISSNLinking": "0095-9901"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15XUH0X66N", "NameOfSubstance": "Tolonium Chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Staining and Labeling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tolonium Chloride"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Acta Physiol Pharmacol Neerl. 1951;2(1):112-28", "ArticleIdList": ["14877577"]}, {"Citation": "Lab Invest. 1952;1(4):413-31", "ArticleIdList": ["13023989"]}, {"Citation": "J Histochem Cytochem. 1956 Mar;4(2):159-89", "ArticleIdList": ["13306945"]}, {"Citation": "J Am Chem Soc. 1948 Nov;70(11):3683-9", "ArticleIdList": ["18102923"]}, {"Citation": "J Histochem Cytochem. 1954 May;2(3):196-208", "ArticleIdList": ["13163394"]}, {"Citation": "J Histochem Cytochem. 1954 Sep;2(5):322-33", "ArticleIdList": ["13192322"]}, {"Citation": "J Histochem Cytochem. 1955 May;3(3):227-37", "ArticleIdList": ["14381610"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1958", "Month": "7", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1958", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1958", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1959", "Month": "1", "Day": "25"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["13563551", "PMC2224493", "10.1083/jcb.4.4.433"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
