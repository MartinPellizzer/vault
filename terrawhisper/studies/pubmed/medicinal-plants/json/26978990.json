Statistical analysis of species, distributions, and others of Chinese endemic seed plant from Tibetan medicine plants and usually used in the clinic of Tibetan medicine. The results showed that there are 523 species (25%) of Chinese endemic seed plant, belonging to 65 families and 162 genera, in about 2 000 varieties of Tibetan medicine plants recorded in relevant literatures. There are 180 Chinese endemic seed plant species (28%) belonging to 42 families and 72 genera from 625 medicine plants usually used in the clinic of Tibetan medicine. Specifically, the most of these Chinese endemic seed plant species are characteristic crude drug used in Tibetan medicine, and mainly or only distributed in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. And a few species of them were intersected with traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) and other ethnic medicines. In addition, about 10% are listed in China Species Red List. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is the most abundant areas of Areal-types of the Chinese endemic seed plant. This is the biological and ecological reason formation the characteristics of Tibetan medicine plant resources. Therefore, strengthen the research of Chinese endemic seed plants used in Tibetan medicine is great significance for the reasonable protection and utilization of Tibetan medicine plant resources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Hua-rong", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mu", "ForeName": "Ze-jing", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Xiao-lang", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Jun-wei", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Lan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Guo-yue", "Initials": "GY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Tibetan Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tibet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26978990"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
