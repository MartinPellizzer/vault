Pyrola herbs were used as medicinal plants for a long history with wide-ranging activities such as nourishing kidney-yang, strengthening muscles and bones, activating blood, stopping bleeding, dispelling rheumatism, and eliminating dampness. Currently, the research on Pyrola plants is increasing year by year but there is no comprehensive and detailed review concerning genus Pyrola. This review aims to sum up the updated and comprehensive information about botany and traditional use, phytochemistry, pharmacological activities and safety by analyzing the information available on Pyrola plants via internationally accepted scientific databases. Collectively, more than 100 compounds have been isolated from the Pyrola plants. Furthermore, a total of 33 prescriptions containing Pyrola plants are compiled in this review. Pyrola plants are used as indispensable agents in traditional Chinese medicine due to its activities of antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, lipidlowering, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular protection, proliferation of osteoblasts promoting, antineoplastic and etc. Further work should be developed on the elucidation of structure-function relationship, understanding of multi-target pharmacological effects, as well as developing its application both in clinical usage and functional food for research and development of Pyrola plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9
