The aim of this study was to demonstrate that it is feasible to detect directly in vivo free radicals coming from food with the use of low frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Because polyphenols are easily oxidized into stable radicals, we assumed that these radicals could be detected in food. We chose licorice, which contains several types of polyphenols. The presence of free radicals was demonstrated in licorice-flavored sweets. Using low frequency EPR spectroscopy, we detected these free radicals directly and noninvasively after oral administration to mice. These radicals were rather stable in the guts of the mice. This study is the first report demonstrating noninvasively the presence of free radicals in vivo coming from food."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry and Radiopharmacy, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gallez", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baudelet", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Debuyst", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10867059", "10.1093/jn/130.7.1831"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
