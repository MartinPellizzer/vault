Evidence is lacking of rutin's anxiolytic-like activity, putative mechanism(s) of action, and neural sites of effects. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is the main brain region that regulates anxiety, through GABAA/benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors, which are modulated by flavonoids. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to investigate whether the anxiolytic-like effect of rutin involves GABAA/BDZ receptors in the BLA. Rutin was administered systemically (30-1000\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or microinjected into the BLA (16\u2009nmol/4\u2009\u00b5l, intracerebral), and its effects were assessed in the elevated plus-maze and open-field tests. Diazepam (1\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneal, or 7\u2009nmol/4\u2009\u00b5l, respectively) was used as a positive control. The mechanism of action was studied using flumazenil (BDZ antagonist, 5\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneal, or 7\u2009nmol/4\u2009\u00b5l, intracerebral) or picrotoxin (chloride channel GABAA antagonist, 0.3\u2009nmol/4\u2009\u00b5l, intracerebral). Rutin, administered systemically or intra-amygdala, induced anxiolytic-like responses, similar to those of diazepam. The effect of diazepam was completely blocked by flumazenil, which also partly antagonized the effects of systemic rutin. By contrast, flumazenil exerted no effect and picrotoxin had only a partial action when rutin was infused in the BLA. These results suggest that the anxiolytic-like effect of rutin in the BLA involves GABAergic neurotransmission that is not associated with BDZ receptors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "aDepartment of Pharmacobiology, Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute (CINVESTAV) bLaboratory of Neuropharmacology of Natural Products, Direction of Research in Neurosciences, National Institute of Psychiatry, Mexico City, Mexico."}], "LastName": "Hernandez-Leon", "ForeName": "Alberto", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Trujano", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Guasti", "ForeName": "Alonso", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Behav Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9013016", "ISSNLinking": "0955-8810"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "GABA Modulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, GABA-A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "40P7XK9392", "NameOfSubstance": "Flumazenil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5G06TVY3R7", "NameOfSubstance": "Rutin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q3JTX2Q7TU", "NameOfSubstance": "Diazepam"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Anxiety"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Basolateral Nuclear Complex"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diazepam"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flumazenil"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "GABA Modulators"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maze Learning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, GABA-A"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Rutin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28145981", "10.1097/FBP.0000000000000290"]}}]}
