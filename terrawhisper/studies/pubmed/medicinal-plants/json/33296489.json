The aim of this study is to investigate the anti-sickling efficacy of some medicinal plants used by rural communities in Gwagwalada, Abuja, for management of SCD.", "Phytochemical screening and mineral analysis were carried out. Anti-sickling activity of the extracts was evaluated by monitoring (within 150 minutes) the percentage reduction in sickle red cells, after incubating different doses of the methanolic extracts with sickled red blood cells induced with 2% sodium metabisulphite. Parahydoxybenzoic acid (PHBA) and normal saline was used as positive and negative control respectively.", "Phytochemical screening of the methanolic extracts revealed the presence of alkaloids, tannins, phenols and terpenoids. Significant anti-sickling activity was observed in two, out of the four plant extracts tested. Pavetta crassipes and Ziziphus mauritiana at the high dose of 0.5mg/ml caused a significant reduction in percentage of sickle red cells from 44.0% to 15.3% (PC) and 44.9% to 20.5% (ZM) respectively at 150 minutes. This is comparable to the control sample (PHBA) where sickle red cells reduced from 43.9% to 14.6 % at 150 minutes.", "The results of this study showed that methanolic extract of P. crassipes and Z. mauritiana possess anti-sickling activity. This provides a scientific basis for their use as antisickling phytomedicine and makes further research into their mechanism of action necessary."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, University of Abuja, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Alli", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Faculty of Basic Clinical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, University of Abuja, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Nnodu", "ForeName": "O E", "Initials": "OE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Nigeria", "MedlineTA": "West Afr J Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8301891", "ISSNLinking": "0189-160X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Anemia, Sickle Cell"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "9"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33296489"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
