Tropical Animal Health and Production. Village chickens contribute significantly towards rural livelihood in the African continent through the provision of animal protein, income and socio-cultural uses. However, village chickens are susceptible to parasite infestation. Due to limitations of using western drugs to control these parasites, farmers resort to the use of ethno-veterinary medicine (EVM). However, there is dearth of information on EVM use in chickens. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to document various EVM practices used in controlling gastro-intestinal parasites in village chickens. Stratified random sampling was used to select 62 chicken farmers that were interviewed using a structured questionnaire About 70 and 96.7% of farmers provided housing and water for their chickens respectively whereas the rest did not. The chief role of chickens was meat provision (91.7%). Most households (86%) reported parasite problems in chickens, particularly gastro-intestinal parasites. Eighty-three percent of the interviewed respondents use medicinal plants to control both internal and external parasites in chickens. Use of plants increased with parasite incidences (r=0.347; P<0.01). Mainly gastro-intestinal parasites were problematic and were largely controlled by medicinal plants. Further research on pharmacological properties, safety and efficacy of these plants is important for improved chicken productivity and hence rural livelihood."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Livestock and Pasture Science, University of Fort Hare, Alice 5700, South Africa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mwale", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Masika", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Trop Anim Health Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "1277355", "ISSNLinking": "0049-4747"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiparasitic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["economics"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiparasitic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology", "prevention & control", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Parasitic Diseases, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Poultry Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Population"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Trop Anim Health Prod. 2007 May;39(4):309-15", "ArticleIdList": ["17847826"]}, {"Citation": "Trop Anim Health Prod. 2007 Aug;39(6):453-61", "ArticleIdList": ["17966277"]}, {"Citation": "Trop Anim Health Prod. 2008 Feb;40(2):101-9", "ArticleIdList": ["18422252"]}, {"Citation": "Trends Parasitol. 2005 Oct;21(10):462-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16099722"]}, {"Citation": "Trends Parasitol. 2007 Jan;23(1):21-4", "ArticleIdList": ["17118708"]}, {"Citation": "Trop Anim Health Prod. 2007 Apr;39(3):189-97", "ArticleIdList": ["17691543"]}, {"Citation": "Trop Anim Health Prod. 2009 Apr;41(4):517-23", "ArticleIdList": ["18704741"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19462254", "10.1007/s11250-009-9366-z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
