The plant has an impressive profile of medicinal uses in the folk medicine system of several civilizations.", "This comprehensive study is aimed to characterize phytochemicals in fruit of W. somnifera and tested for anticancer potential to find out active candidate in disease prevention and treatment.", "The bioactive components from W. somn-ifera fruit were extracted with polar and non-polar solvents. Anticancer potential of the isolated bioactive was assessed against different cancer cell lines through MTT assay and Incucytes imaging analysis. The extracts were characterized for secondary metabolites using GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometer), LCMS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry)-ESI (electrospray Ionization) and 1H-NMR (electrospray Ionization) techniques.", "Both freeze-dried and rotary evaporator con-densed extracts exhibited anticancer potential against MDA-MB-231, MCF7- SKOV3 and SKBR3 cell lines. The tested extracts have cell growth inhibition potential ag-ainst mammalian cancer cell line. Hexacosanedioic acid purified from -hexane extract through HPLC was inves-tigated for its cytotoxicity against breast cancer cell line SKBR3 by using Incucytes imaging analysis.", "We found that a variety of bioactive compounds existed in this plant. One identified compound that was not investigated for cytotoxicity in previous studies was purified and its application showed cytotoxicity on breast cancer cell lines. A number of bioactive identified from fruit may have an effective potential for development into chemotherapy drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chemistry, University of Sargodha, Sargodha-40100-, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Tabassam", "ForeName": "Qudsia", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chemistry, University of Sargodha, Sargodha-40100, Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences-UVAS, 54000-Lahore.
