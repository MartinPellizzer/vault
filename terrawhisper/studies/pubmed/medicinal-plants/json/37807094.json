In July, 2022, a leaves spot disease on D. odorifera with typical anthracnose symptoms was observed in plantations in Haikou (110.319153\u00b0E, 19.072900\u00b0N), Dongfang (108.630297\u00b0E, 19.103838\u00b0N) and Qiongzhong (109.704460\u00b0E, 19.088440\u00b0N), Hainan Province, China. Disease incidence was 7.5% (n = 50 plants). Early symptoms of infected leaves were small and round dark brown spots, which developed into larger irregular necrotic lesions and leaves withered. Leaf tissues (5\u00d75 mm) at the disease-health junction of spots from 19 leaves were sterilized with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite for 1 min, and rinsed with sterile distilled water three times. These sterilized tissues were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 28 \u2103 for 5 d. 7 strains of fungi with similar morphology were isolated, and 3 single-hyphal isolates (HHL01, HHL02 and HHL03) from each location were selected for further study. Colonies on PDA were fluffy orange-yellow mycelium. Conidia were aseptate, cylindrical, smooth-walled, straight, hyaline with both ends bluntly rounded, 11.82 to 15.77 \u00d7 3.87 to 6.71 \u03bcm (n = 100; average = 13.75 \u00d7 5.52 \u03bcm). Appressoria formed on slides, measured 5.54 to 10.64 \u00d7 4.19 to 7.41 \u03bcm (n = 30; average = 8.06 \u00d7 5.97 \u03bcm) were brown to black, elliptical to irregular. For molecular biological identification, the genomic DNA of three isolates was extracted by fungal genomic DNA extraction kit (Tiangen Biotech (Beijing) Co., Ltd.). The partial sequences of internal transcribed spacer region (ITS; ITS1/ITS4), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; GDF1/GDR1), actin (ACT; ACT512F/ACT783R), \u03b2-tubulin (TUB2; TI/Bt2b) and calmodulin (CAL; CL1C/CL2C) were amplified and sequenced by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd (Carbone and Kohn, 1999; Weir et al., 2012). The sequences were deposited as GenBank Accession Nos. OR018110-OR018112 (ITS); OR050529-OR050537 (GAPDH, ACT and CAL) and OR192168-OR192170 (TUB). BLASTn results showed these sequences were more than 99% identity with the strain of C. karstii CORCK1 (GenBank Accession Nos. HM585406, HM585387, HM581991, HM585424 and HM582010, respectively). Multi-locus phylogenetic tree of Colletotrichum spp. showed that those three isolates were sister to C. karstii based on the maximum likelihood and bayesian inference methods. To verify pathogenicity, 2 mL spore suspension (1 \u00d7 106conidia/ml) of the isolates was sprayed on each leaves of 1-year-old D. odorifera plants, and sterile distilled water was similarly sprayed on other leaves as a negative control. The plants were incubated in a greenhouse under 90% \u00b1 5% RH at 28 \u00b0C. Light brown small round necrotic patches developed 3 days after inoculation, while the control was asymptomatic. Photographs were taken on the fifth day after inoculation. The fungi were re-isolated from the diseased leaves and identified by morphological characterization and molecular identification, fulfilling Koch's postulates. C. karstii has been reported causing leaf rot of Carissa grandiflora in Spain (Garcia-Lopez et al., 2021), and anthracnose caused by C.tropicale was reported on D. odorifera (Yi et al., 2023). To our knowledge, this is the first report of Dalbergia odorifera leaf spot disease caused by Colletotrichum karstii. This finding provides an important basis for further research on the control of the disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan University, 74629, School of Life Sciences, Haikou, Hainan, China; 1813056320@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jiujuan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment and Plant Protection Institute, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences, Haikou, Hainan, China; jinhuasun_hk@163.com."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jinhua", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment and Plant Protection Institute, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences, Haikou, Hainan 571101, China, Haikou, Hainan, China, 571101; coldminerer@163.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Southern Subtropical Crops Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences, Zhanjiang, Guangdong 524091, China, zhanjiang, China, 524091; gd-qiang@163.com."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Deqiang", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan University, 74629, School of Plant Protection, No. 58, Renmin Avenue, Meilan District, Haikou, Hainan, China, 570288; 1723378853@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jinyu", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University, 71206, Center for Research and Development of Fine Chemicals, Guiyang, Guizhou, China; 1458677956@qq.com."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan University, 74629, School of Life Sciences, Haikou, Hainan, China; liuzhiqiang@hainanu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhiqiang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment and Plant Protection Institute, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences, No.4 Xueyuan road, Haikou, Hainan, China, 571101; humeijiao320@163.com."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Meijiao", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37807094", "10.1094/PDIS-08-23-1592-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
