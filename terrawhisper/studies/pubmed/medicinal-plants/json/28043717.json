Occurrence of the drug resistance to the insulin and leptin receptor is also challenging major issues. The molecules that can overcome this resistance problem could be effective for the treatment of both type II diabetes and obesity. Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (PTP) has emerged as new promising targets for therapeutic purpose in recent years. Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP 1B) act as a negative regulator of insulin and leptin receptor signalling pathways. Several approaches have been successfully applied to find out potent and selective inhibitors. This article reviews PTP 1B inhibitors; natural, synthetic and semi-synthetic that showed inhibition towards enzyme as a major target for the management of type II diabetes. These studies could be contributing the future development of PTP 1B inhibitors as drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc.
