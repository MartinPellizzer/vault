However, its application is associated with serious side effects in various organs including the kidneys and liver.", "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mallow extract on the side effects of cisplatin in the kidneys and liver.", "Hydroalcoholic extract of mallow, at doses of 200, 400, and 600\u2009mg/kg BW, was administered to the animals for seven days intraperitoneally (ip). Animals in the Cis\u2009+\u2009Mallow group received a dose of cisplatin (8\u2009mg/kg, ip) on the third day. Renal and hepatic functional disturbances were evaluated by measuring concentrations of creatinine, urea-nitrogen, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in the plasma. In order to assess oxidative stress, malondialdehyde (MDA) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) levels were measured in the kidney tissue. Then, degree of mRNA expressions of TNF-\u03b1 and ICAM-1 were measured to examine renal inflammation. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H & E) staining of kidney and liver tissues was performed to study tissue damage and leukocyte infiltration.", "Cisplatin increased levels of plasma creatinine, urea-nitrogen, AST, and ALT; levels of tissue damage and leukocytes infiltration in the kidneys and liver; and MDA level and expression of pro-inflammatory factors in the kidney tissue. Meanwhile, it decreased FRAP level in the kidney tissue. Pretreatment by mallow extract resulted in significant improvement in all measured variables although 200-mg and 400-mg doses yielded better results.", "Results showed that mallow supplement protects the kidneys and liver against side effects of cisplatin, and reduces the resultant oxidative stress and inflammation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
