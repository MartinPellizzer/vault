We found a wide range of clinical and other in vivo studies for many of the plant-based therapies utilized in the Ayurvedic system. Of the 166 plants investigated, 72 (43%) had at least one or more human studies and 103 (62%) had one or more animal studies. These results appear to contradict the generally held notion that herbal remedies used in non-Western systems of botanical medicine have not been evaluated in human or in vivo trials. Some of these studies are not always as large or methodologically rigorous as clinical studies reported in major medical journals. Indeed, a critical assessment of the research according to the standards of evidence-based medicine would eliminate many of these studies for lack of rigor according to criteria of randomization, sample size, adequacy of controls, etc. However, the studies do suggest which species might be appropriate for larger and better-controlled trials in the future. Accordingly, a synopsis of the plants, their therapeutic applications, and their clinical or experimental evaluations is presented."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Economic Botany, The New York Botanical Garden, Bronx 10458, USA. mbalick@nybg.org"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balick", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Altern Complement Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9508124", "ISSNLinking": "1075-5535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Altern Complement Med. 2001 Oct;7(5):389-92. doi: 10.1089/10755530152639693", "PMID": "11719938"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "5"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11719942", "10.1089/10755530152639729"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
