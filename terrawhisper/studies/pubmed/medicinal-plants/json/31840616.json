It has been predicted that 9 million people suffer from tuberculosis disease and 1.5 - 2 million deaths occur by this disease.", "The aim of this research is to know the species of plant used as anti-hematemesis medicine that has the activity of antituberculosis and antituberculosis-MDR and then investigate the phytochemistry characteristics of the compound from every parts of the plant extract that show the activity of antituberculosis and antituberculosis-MDR which is indicated by the value of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the extracts.", "The extraction method used in this research was the maceration method. The antituberculosis activity test was investigated using MODS and LJ media methods. The isolation of the active compound was carried out using Bioassay Guided Fractionation and then the compound characteristics were identified using spectroscopy data.", "The results showed that extracts from Talas (Collocasia esculenta tuber) and Kariango (Acorus calamus rhizome) plants were active against M. tuberculosis. The FTIR spectroscopy data showed that three isolates obtained from Talas plants contained aliphatic OH and C-O and CH groups. The MIC values of kariango and Talas extracts using the MODS method were 45 mg/ml and 40 mg/ml, respectively.", "Talas (Collocasia esculenta) tuber and Kariango rhizome ethanolic extract have a potency for antituberculosis and anti-MDR tuberculosis drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Hasanuddin, Makassar, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Rante", "ForeName": "Herlina", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Hasanuddin, Makassar, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Alam", "ForeName": "Gemini", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Hasanuddin, Makassar, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Sartini"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Hasanuddin, Makassar, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Permana", "ForeName": "Andi Dian", "Initials": "AD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biopharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Hasanuddin, Makassar, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Usmar"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of pharmacy, University of Hasanuddin, Makassar, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Burhamzah", "ForeName": "Rahmita", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Hasanuddin, Makassar, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Alimuddin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Math and Science, Universitas Negeri Makassar, Makassar, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Budiarti", "ForeName": "Mery", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Infect Disord Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "101269158", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5265"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indonesia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31840616", "10.2174/1871526520666191216121302", "IDDT-EPUB-102994"]}}]}
