No changes in food consumption were observed, but the food intake:weight gain ratio was increased in those animals. Plasma protein, triacylglycerols and cholesterol values were not affected by the dietary treatment although serum glucose and zinc levels fell after legume intake as well as the number of circulating erythrocytes. The relative enlargement of thymus and spleen in the legume-fed mice was apparently accompanied by a reduction in the cell number and an increase in cell size, while the protein synthesis capacity followed differentiated patterns in both tissues when assessed through protein, DNA and RNA determinations. The haemagglutination titres and the number of rosette-forming cells were lower in those animals fed on the field bean diet as well as the splenic lymphocyte responses to phytohaemagglutinin, Concanavalin A or lipopolysaccharide mitogens used to evaluate the functional status of T and B lymphocytes. The present study describes, apparently for the first time in mice, the involvement of field bean intake in some immunological disturbances affecting both humoral- and cell-mediated aspects of the immune response."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition and Food Science, University of Pa\u00eds Vasco, Vitoria, Spain."}], "LastName": "Mart\u00ednez", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Macarulla", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Marcos", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Larralde", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0372547", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Growth"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemagglutination Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunocompetence"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscles"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Nutritional Status"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Thymus Gland"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1445828", "10.1079/bjn19920107"]}}]}
