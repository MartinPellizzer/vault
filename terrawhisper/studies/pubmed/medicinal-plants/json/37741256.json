Benth, Euodia rutaecarpa (Juss.) Benth. var. officinalis (Dode) Huang, or Euodia rutaecarpa (Juss.) Benth. var. bodinieri (Dode) Huang, is a famous herbal medicine with several biological activities and therapeutic values, which has been applied for abdominalgia, abdominal distension, vomiting, and diarrhea as a complementary and alternative therapy in clinic. Indole alkaloids, particularly evodiamine (EVO), rutaecarpine (RUT), and dedhydroevodiamine (DHE), are received rising attention as the major bioactivity compounds in Evodia rutaecarpa. Therefore, this review summarizes the physicochemical properties, pharmacological activities, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic effects on gastrointestinal diseases of these three indole alkaloids with original literature collected by PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, and CNKI up to June 2023. Despite sharing the same parent nucleus, EVO, RUT, and DHE have different structural and chemical properties, which result in different advantages of biological effects. In their wide range of pharmacological activities, the anti-migratory activity of RUT is less effective than that of EVO, and the neuroprotection of DHE is significant. Additionally, although DHE has a higher bioavailability, EVO and RUT display better permeabilities within blood-brain barrier. These three indole alkaloids can alleviate gastrointestinal inflammatory in particular, and EVO also has outstanding anti-cancer effect, although clinical trials are still required to further support their therapeutic potential."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
