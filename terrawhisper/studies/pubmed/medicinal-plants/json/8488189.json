The exposure for one and two weeks to alpha-asarone (1-50 micrograms/ml) produced intracytoplasmic lipid droplets and at higher concentrations (25-50 micrograms/ml) retraction of the hepatocyte cords and cell detachment. Ultrastructurally, the treated cultures (10 micrograms/ml) showed enlargement and vacuolization of the mitochondria in addition to lipid droplets. The triacylglycerol content increased up to 2.3-fold in the cultures treated for one week with 50 micrograms/ml, whereas the protein content per culture, a rough estimate of cell number and viability, decreased by up to 53% in the cultures treated for two weeks with 50 micrograms/ml. The synthesis and secretion of proteins, measured by the incorporation of [3H]-leucine into cellular and secreted macromolecules, decreased also in the cultures exposed. After one and two week exposure to 50 micrograms/ml of alpha-asarone, the secretion of labeled proteins decreased by 53 and 67%, respectively, whereas the synthesis of cellular and total proteins decreased by 48-67%, respectively. The secretion of proteins was the most sensitive parameter of alpha-asarone toxicity. The mean inhibitory dose (ID50), i.e, that producing 50% inhibition in the incorporation of the labeled precursor, was 22.12 and 5.04 micrograms/ml after one and two weeks exposure, respectively. Our results show that long-term exposure to micromolar concentrations of alpha-asarone produces morphologic and ultrastructural alterations, triacylglycerol accumulation (fatty liver), and inhibition of protein synthesis and secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacology and Toxicology Department, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Estudios Avanzados del IPN, M\u00e9xico, D.F."}], "LastName": "L\u00f3pez", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hern\u00e1ndez", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chamorro", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mendoza-Figueroa", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allylbenzene Derivatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anisoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "asarone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "3T3 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allylbenzene Derivatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Anisoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8488189", "10.1055/s-2006-959624"]}}]}
