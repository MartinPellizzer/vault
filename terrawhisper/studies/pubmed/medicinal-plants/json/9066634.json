The purpose of the present research was to determine if apigenin is effective in the prevention of ultraviolet-B light (UVB) induced skin carcinogenesis. Further studies ascertained if apigenin would be expected to absorb UVB light in a manner to prevent DNA damage in a cell free system. ODC activity was induced with 0.45 J/cm2 ultraviolet A and B (UVA/B) light. Apigenin (5 mumoles/200 microliters DMSO:acetone, 1:9) treatment from 12 hours before until 1 hour following UVA/B exposure was effective in inhibition (25-45% inhibition) of ODC activity measured at 28 hours following UVA/B exposure. Mouse skin carcinogenesis was induced by exposure to a total dose of 40 J/cm2 UVB over 11 weeks. Treatment with 10 mumoles apigenin in 200 microliters DMSO:acetone (1:9) prior to each UVB exposure resulted in reduction in cancer incidence (52% inhibition) and an increase in tumor free survival in comparison with control mice (P < 0.01). Apigenin (0-100 microM) did not prevent the in vitro production of photoproducts in salmon sperm DNA suggesting that apigenin did not inhibit UVA/B induced ODC activity or UVB induced skin carcinogenesis by simply absorbing ultraviolet light or decreasing DNA damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eppley Institute for Cancer Research, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198, USA."}], "LastName": "Birt", "ForeName": "D F", "Initials": "DF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mitchell", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gold", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pour", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pinch", "ForeName": "H C", "Initials": "HC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P30 CA36727", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8102988", "ISSNLinking": "0250-7005"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chamomile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9066634"]}}]}
