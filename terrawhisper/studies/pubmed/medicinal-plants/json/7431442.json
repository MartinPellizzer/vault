For the examination, 5, 5 and 10 rats were sacrificed after 3, 8 and 21 days respectively. In the group to which raw garlic juice (5 ml/kg) was administered 5 rats died of the serious stomach injury in 21 days and body weight of still living rats was down at the beginning as food and water intake were decreased. The growth of rats to which raw garlic juice administered group was retarded. The retardation of growth was thought to be caused by the stomach injury due to raw garlic, which limited in fundus. The injured section of stomach was not far gone by the longer administration, however, the mucous secretion of the surface and neck area were stimulated. Swelling of the liver, hypertrophy of the spleen and adrenal glands, and the decrease of erythrocytes with various morphological changes were clearly observed after 3 and 8 days on the group dosed high raw garlic juice, but almost these changes were not observed at any time on extracted-aged garlic juice administration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nakagawa", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Masamoto", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sumiyoshi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kunihiro", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fuwa", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "7805798", "ISSNLinking": "0388-1350"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Growth"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7431442", "10.2131/jts.5.91"]}}]}
