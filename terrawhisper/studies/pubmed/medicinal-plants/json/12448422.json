Within a single population of plants exposed to light at the same time, NOX activities of all plants function synchronously. Exposure of plants transferred from darkness to blue light (495 nm, 2 min, 50 micromoles m-2 s-1) resulted in a complex response pattern but with a new maximum in the rate of NOX activity 36 (24+12) min after illumination and then with maxima in the rate of NOX activity every 24 min thereafter. Transient maxima in NOX activity were observed as well after 9.3 + /- 1.4 and 20.7 +/- 2.1 min. The blue light response differed from the response to red (650 nm, 10 min, 50 micromoles m-2 s-1) or white light where activity maxima were initiated 12 min after the light exposure followed by maxima every 24 min thereafter. Green or yellow light was ineffective. The light response was independent of the time in the 24-min NOX cycle when the light was given. The net effects of blue and red light were ultimately the same with a new maximum in the rate of NOX activity at 12+24=36 min (and every 24 min thereafter), but the mechanisms appear to be distinct."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA. morre@pharmacy.purdue.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morre", "ForeName": "D James", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Penel", "ForeName": "Claude", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Greppin", "ForeName": "Hubert", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morre", "ForeName": "Dorothy M", "Initials": "DM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Plant Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9886579", "ISSNLinking": "1058-5893"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Multienzyme Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.-", "NameOfSubstance": "NADH oxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.-", "NameOfSubstance": "NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Circadian Rhythm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Darkness"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Multienzyme Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spinacia oleracea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12448422", "10.1086/340543"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
