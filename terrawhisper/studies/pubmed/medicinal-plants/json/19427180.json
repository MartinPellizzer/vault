The clinical therapeutic effects of DHI on traumatic intracranial hematoma (TICH) were observed. Eighty patients with TICH were randomly assigned to trial group and a control group (40 patients per group), and all were administered with routine medication. Additionally, DIH was administered intravenously to patients in the trial group. Pre and post-treatment GCS was observed in the two groups, along with GOS after therapy. The intracranial hematoma absorption, hemorheological changes, and changes in coagulation indexes pre- and post-treatment were evaluated. The results indicated that GCS and GOS after therapy for the trial group were superior to those for the control group (p<0.05). There was a significant post-treatment difference in the intracranial hematoma absorption between the two groups (p<0.01). Each hemorheological index in the trial group improved significantly as compared with that of the control group (p<0.05 or p<0.01). The plasma levels of fibrinogen and D-dimer in the trial group were significantly decreased after therapy (p<0.01). These results suggest that DHI is conducive to the recovery of patients with TICH."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Second Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "J-J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shan", "ForeName": "J-Z", "Initials": "JZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "C-Y", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Y-L", "Initials": "YL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Phytomedicine", "NlmUniqueID": "9438794", "ISSNLinking": "0944-7113"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiovascular Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "danhong"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "fibrin fragment D"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9001-32-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Fibrinogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Viscosity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carthamus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Coma"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Aggregation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fibrinogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Intracranial Hemorrhage, Traumatic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19427180", "10.1016/j.phymed.2009.03.020", "S0944-7113(09)00088-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
