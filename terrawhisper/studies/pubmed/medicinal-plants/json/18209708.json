Extract of one of the plants, Tacca integrifolia Ker-Gawl., was found to be mutagenic using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. Extract of T. integrifolia, Eurycoma longifolia Jack and Helmintostachys zeylanica (L.) Hook were cytotoxic to human cell lines, Hep2 and HFL1, with IC50 ranging from 11 mug/ml to 55 mug/ml. Extract of E. longifolia was the most cytotoxic with IC50 of 11 mug/ml and 13 mug/ml on Hep2 and HFL1 cell lines respectively. Combined extract of T. integrifolia and H. zeylanica was more cytotoxic than single extract on both Hep2 and HFL1 cell lines while combined extract of E. longifolia and H. zeylanica was more cytotoxic than single extract on Hep2 cell lines. Under the conditions of this study it can be concluded that T. integrifolia is mutagenic and the combined extracts of the medicinal plants was highly cytotoxic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infectious Disease Research Centre, Institute for Medical Research, 50588 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. fuat@imr.gov.my"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohd-Fuat", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kofi", "ForeName": "E A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Allan", "ForeName": "G G C", "Initials": "GG"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "MC_U106179471", "Acronym": "MRC_", "Agency": "Medical Research Council", "Country": "United Kingdom"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Malaysia", "MedlineTA": "Trop Biomed", "NlmUniqueID": "8507086", "ISSNLinking": "0127-5720"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia, Southeastern"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Eurycoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18209708"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
