Numerous scientific discoveries and industrial age gave a big contribution to medicine development and significantly improved quality of life for psychiatric patients during the last century. However, evidence-based medicine after big bliss faced a lot of disappointments, and an attitude that some natural drugs were unnecessarily thrown out of use step by step came along. On the other hand, there are a huge number of patients that use natural medicinal plants in self-treatment of different psychiatric disorders. The aim of this article is not giving advantage to natural medicines over chemicals, nor to support self-treatment. The aim is to encourage thinking about the meaning of natural medicines in the treatment of mental disorders and an attempt of preventing to push them out totally into silence wherever it is justified and based on facts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, University of Mostar, 88000 Mostar, Bosnia & Herzegovina. dragan.babic@tel.net.ba"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Babi\u0107", "ForeName": "Dragan", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Croatia", "MedlineTA": "Psychiatr Danub", "NlmUniqueID": "9424753", "ISSNLinking": "0353-5053"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthracenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Omega-3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5QD5427UN7", "NameOfSubstance": "Perylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7V2F1075HD", "NameOfSubstance": "hypericin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anthracenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Omega-3"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kava"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Mental Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Perylene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Valerian"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17914328"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
