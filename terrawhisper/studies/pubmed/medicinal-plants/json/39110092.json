We proposed that the <i>in vivo</i> biocompatibility/nanotoxicity of GO is protein corona-dependent and host immunity-dependent. The hypothesis was tested by injecting HC<sub>high/low</sub> GO nanosheets in immunocompetent ICR/CD1 and immunodeficient NOD-<i>scid II2r\u03b3</i><sup><i>null</i></sup> mice and performed histopathological and hematological evaluation studies on days 1 and 14 post-injection. HC<sub>low</sub> GO induced more severe acute lung injury compared to HC<sub>high</sub> GO in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice, with the effect being particularly pronounced in immunocompetent animals. Additionally, HC<sub>low</sub> GO caused more significant liver injury in both types of mice, with immunodeficient mice being more susceptible to its hepatotoxic effects. Moreover, administration of HC<sub>low</sub> GO resulted in increased hematological toxicity and elevated levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines in immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice, respectively. Correlation studies were conducted to explore the impact of distinct protein corona compositions on resulting toxicities in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice. This facilitated the identification of consistent patterns, aligning with those observed <i>in vitro</i>, thus indicating a robust <i>in vitro-in vivo</i> correlation. This research will advance our comprehension of how hard corona proteins interact with immune cells, leading to toxicity, and will facilitate the development of improved immune-modulating nanomaterials for therapeutic purposes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Cancer & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, Franklin-Wilkins Building, London SE1 9NH, U.K."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, No. 9, Beijing Road, Yunyan District, Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yue-Ting", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6045-2154"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Cancer & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, Franklin-Wilkins Building, London SE1 9NH, U.K."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, State University of New York at Binghamton, 96 Corliss Avenue, Johnson City, New York 13790, United States."}], "LastName": "Mei", "ForeName": "Kuo-Ching", "Initials": "KC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Cancer & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, Franklin-Wilkins Building, London SE1 9NH, U.K."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong SAR, China."}], "LastName": "Liam-Or", "ForeName": "Revadee", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Cancer & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, Franklin-Wilkins Building, London SE1 9NH, U.K."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Julie Tzu-Wen", "Initials": "JT"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5718-0039"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Cancer & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, Franklin-Wilkins Building, London SE1 9NH, U.K."}], "LastName": "Faruqu", "ForeName": "Farid N", "Initials": "FN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Qiannan People's Hospital, No. 9, Wenfeng Road, Duyun 558000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Shengzhang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, No. 9, Beijing Road, Yunyan District, Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Cancer & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, Franklin-Wilkins Building, London SE1 9NH, U.K."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, No. 9, Beijing Road, Yunyan District, Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5165-2699"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Cancer & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, Franklin-Wilkins Building, London SE1 9NH, U.K."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong SAR, China."}], "LastName": "Al-Jamal", "ForeName": "Khuloud T", "Initials": "KT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Nano", "NlmUniqueID": "101313589", "ISSNLinking": "1936-0851"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39110092", "10.1021/acsnano.4c08561"]}}]}
