Scientific literature reveals several medicinal plants and natural products alleviate experimentally induced fluoride toxicity. The present review attempts to collate those experimental studies on medicinal plants and plant derived natural products with fluoride toxicity ameliorative effects. Literature scrutiny was performed by using online bibliographic databases and the studies for the last 15 years were considered. Minerals and semi-synthetic or synthetic analogs of natural products were excluded. Literature study revealed that 25 medicinal plants and 17 natural products exhibited significant protection from fluoride toxicity in experimental animal models i.e., preclinical studies. Two clinical studies on medicinal plants were also found in literature showing beneficial yet poorly correlated outcome. Relevant research in this field could lead to development of a potentially useful agent in therapeutic management of fluoride toxicity in humans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "West Bengal Medical Services Corporation Ltd., GN 29, Sector V, Salt Lake City, Kolkata 700091, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Bhattacharya", "ForeName": "Sanjib", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "8501420", "ISSNLinking": "0731-8898"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "Q80VPU408O", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "24"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36734952", "10.1615/JEnvironPatholToxicolOncol.2022043545", "232fb3bb699e4efc,421d2bf410cef41e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
