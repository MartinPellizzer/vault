Sortase A (SrtA), as an important virulence factor, is a membrane-localized cysteine transpeptidase which anchors cell surface proteins to the cell wall. Natural products in medicinal plants are the source of targeting bacterial virulence factors. Here, we found polyphenolic glycosides (1-15), including thirteen new derivatives isolated from the stems of Caesalpinia cucullata, exhibited weak to moderate SrtA inhibitory activity without affecting the growth of MRSA, and compound 7 (53.7\u00a0% inhibition at 100\u00a0\u03bcM) was superior to the positive control curcumin. Meanwhile, compounds 2, 4 and 8 could effectively reduce the dose of ceftiofur in combination in vitro with fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) ranging from 0.188 to 0.375, which meant polyphenolic glycosides have got antibacterial activity with different ways. Here, we reported all new compounds structures determined by spectroscopy methods and their antibacterial activities, together, the relationship between structures with the inhibitory efficiency. The results indicated that polyphenolic glycosides could be used as promising therapeutic agents to prevent resistance development for S. aureus infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
