This study bred the first disease-resistant cultivar of notoginseng \"Miaoxiang Kangqi 1\" using the technology of DNA marker-assisted selection of medicinal plants and systematic breeding. The disease-resistant cultivar of notoginseng contained 12 special SNPs based on the analysis of Restriction-site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-Seq). Among the SNP (record_519688) was related to the root rot-resistant characteristics, which indicated this SNP could serve as genetic markers of disease-resistant cultivars and assist the systematic breeding. Compared to the conventional cultivated cultivars, the incidence rate of root-rot and rust-rot in notoginseng seedlings decreased by 83.6% and 71.8%, respectively. The incidence rate of root-rot respectively declined by 43.6% and 62.9% in notoginseng cultivation for 2 and 3 years compared with those of the conventional cultivated cultivars. Additionally, the potential disease-resistant groups were screened based on the relative SNP, and this model enlarged the target groups and advanced the breeding efficiency. DNA marker-assisted selection of medicinal plants accelerated the breeding and promotion of new cultivars, and guaranteed the healthy development of Chinese medicinal materials industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Media, China Academy of Chinese Medicinal Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Lin-Lin", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Sanqi Research, Wenshan University, Wenshan 663000, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhong-Jian", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Sanqi Research, Wenshan University, Wenshan 663000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wenshan Miaoxaing Notoginseng Technology Co., Ltd., Wenshan 663000, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Fu-Gang", "Initials": "FG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Media, China Academy of Chinese Medicinal Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lian-Juan", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Media, China Academy of Chinese Medicinal Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jiang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Media, China Academy of Chinese Medicinal Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Guang-Fei", "Initials": "GF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Media, China Academy of Chinese Medicinal Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Media, China Academy of Chinese Medicinal Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wenshan Miaoxaing Notoginseng Technology Co., Ltd., Wenshan 663000, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wei-Lin", "Initials": "WL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Media, China Academy of Chinese Medicinal Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xi-Wen", "Initials": "XW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wenshan Miaoxaing Notoginseng Technology Co., Ltd., Wenshan 663000, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Yu-Qi", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Media, China Academy of Chinese Medicinal Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shi-Lin", "Initials": "SL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Genetic Markers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Disease Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Markers"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Panax notoginseng"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Selection, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis, DNA"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28945025", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0004"]}}]}
