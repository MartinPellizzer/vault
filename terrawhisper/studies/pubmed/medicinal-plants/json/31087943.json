The characteristics of inorganic carbon release from the soil under three temperature gradients (15, 25, and 35\u2103) and water contents (30%, 65%, and 100% WHC) were studied by adding <sup>14</sup>C-CaCO<sub>3</sub> for 100 d. The results showed that under the different soil moisture and temperature conditions, the maximum rate and the cumulative amount of inorganic carbon release from the soil over 100 days varied between 0.7-16.8 mg\u00b7(kg\u00b7d)<sup>-1</sup>and 5.9-29.4 mg\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, in the brown limestone soil, and varied between 39.7-103.3 mg\u00b7(kg\u00b7d)<sup>-1</sup> and 83.3-135.1 mg\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively in the red soil. Under drought conditions (30% WHC), the cumulative amount of inorganic carbon release was the highest for the two soils and increased with increasing temperature. At 65% WHC and 100% WHC, increasing temperature can still promote inorganic carbon release from the soil. The temperature sensitivity of the soil inorganic carbon release in the brown limestone soil is greater than that of the red soil, which is significantly affected by soil moisture. The soil pH and MBC content were remarkably increased after adding CaCO<sub>3</sub>, and the difference between the two soils was significant. The variance partition showed that temperature and soil moisture can explain 7.6% and 2.0% of the soil inorganic carbon release variability, respectively. In conclusion, warming and drought aggravate inorganic carbon release from brown limestone soil in the southwestern Karst region. Therefore, in the context of global warming and more frequent extreme precipitation events, the effects of soil moisture and temperature on inorganic carbon conversion in soil should be fully considered when studying the soil carbon cycle and its dynamic changes in southwestern Karst. This research can provide a scientific basis for further understanding the influence of climate change on the global carbon cycle."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agro-ecological Processes in Subtropical Region, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changsha 410125, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huanjiang Observation and Research Station for Karst Eco-systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Huanjiang 547100, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xue-Chi", "Initials": "XC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, Nanning 530000, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agro-ecological Processes in Subtropical Region, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changsha 410125, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Xun-Yang", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agricultural, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Gui-Hong", "Initials": "GH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agro-ecological Processes in Subtropical Region, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changsha 410125, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Yi-Rong", "Initials": "YR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31087943", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201807213"]}}]}
