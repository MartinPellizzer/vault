Six overlapping clones that complemented nodulation defects in leucaena and bean rhizobia were isolated and a 40-kb map of the symbiosis region was constructed. The common nod and nifA genes were situated approximately 17 kb apart, with the nodIJ genes in between. These clones enabled a derivative of TAL1145 carrying a partially deleted pSym to form ineffective nodules on both leucaena and bean, and a similar derivative of Rhizobium etli TAL182 to form ineffective nodules on bean. When two representative clones, pUHR9 and pUHR114, were each transferred to wild-type rhizobial strains, they allowed ineffective nodulation by Rhizobium meliloti on both leucaena and bean and by Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. vicia on bean. Transconjugants of R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii formed effective nodules on leucaena and ineffective nodules on bean. Tn5 mutagenesis of the symbiosis region resulted in a variety of nodulation and fixation phenotypes on leucaena and bean. On the basis of 16S rRNA sequences, TAL1145 was found to be distinct from both R. tropici and NGR234, the two groups of leucaena symbionts that were previously described."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Program, University of Hawaii, Honolulu 96822."}], "LastName": "George", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Young", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Borthakur", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["X63824"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372707", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4166"}, "GeneSymbolList": ["nifA", "nod", "nodIJ"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Fixation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Restriction Mapping"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Symbiosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8012908", "10.1139/m94-034"]}}]}
