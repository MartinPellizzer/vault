Emphasis is given to plant species largely used to solve or slow down diarrhoea, malaria, respiratory, and sexual complaints. These diseases, together with malnutrition/ anaemia, mental diseases, and rheumatism/arthritis are the main concern of healthcare countrywide. Diarrhoea is divided into common diarrhoea, bloody-diarrhoea, and cholera; plant species are normally used to slow down diarrhoea recurrence. Tannin is the main chemical compound with both anti-diarrhoeal and antiseptic properties. Traditional medicine seems to be rather helpful in alleviating malaria symptoms such as fever, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Special reference is made to Momordica balsamina, which is highly used to cure vomiting apparently associated with bilis and fever. Rauvolfia caffra contains reserpine, a compound used as anti-hypertension agent. This species is also used as an anti-malarial agent. Traditional medicine seems to have a role in slowing opportunistic infections related to the AIDS virus such as diarrhoea, pneumonia, and skin infections. Prostate hypertrophy is traditionally medicated using mostly Prunus africana and Hypoxis hemerocallidea, species known to contain phytosterol. Research for bioactive compounds in African plants is still in its infancy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bandeira", "ForeName": "S O", "Initials": "SO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gaspar", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pagula", "ForeName": "F P", "Initials": "FP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812552", "ISSNLinking": "1388-0209"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21554173", "10.1076/phbi.39.s1.70.0002"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
