The Ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fraction gave significant antacid activity with an increase in the baseline pH value of 1.2 to 1.61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.00 and 1.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.00 at 50 and 100\u00a0mg, respectively, compared to the antacid activity of sodium bicarbonate (1.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.00, 1.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.00). Five known ecdysteroid compounds isolated from S. jollyanum ethyl acetate and n butanol fractions are Pinnatasterone (1), Polypodine B (2), 20-hydroxyecdysone (3), 20, 26-dihydroxyecdysone, (4) and Atrotosterone A (5). The compounds' structures were determined using extensive 1D and 2D NMR experiments, and the molecular mass for each of the compounds was confirmed by FAB-MS. Compounds 1-5 were evaluated for their urease inhibitory and antacid activities. Fractions were active in comparison with the standard drug acetohydroxamic acid, and sodium bicarbonate, respectively. Compounds 2, 3 and 1 showed significant urease inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub> 7.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.56, 13.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.49 and 14.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.59), respectively. The activity of compounds 4 and 5 were moderate compared to that of acetohydroxamic acid (IC<sub>50</sub> value 20.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.43). Very few compounds have been isolated from this plant despite the numerous biological activities reported for it. The antacid and urease inhibitory activities of this plant and isolated compounds are described for the first time."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
