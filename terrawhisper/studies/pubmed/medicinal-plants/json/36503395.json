The acute and subchronic effects of ALAE on systolic, diastolic, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate (HR) were evaluated after oral administration of ALAE (60 and 100 mg/kg body weight) for 6 h for the acute experiment and over 7 days for the subchronic test. Isolated thoracic aortic rings were prepared to examine the vasorelaxant action of ALAE. Several common pharmacological agents were used to test potential pathways implicated in vasorelaxant action.", "The results showed that ALAE reduced blood pressure parameters (systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressure) in L-NAME-induced hypertension rats after repeated oral treatment over seven days without affecting normotensive rats. Furthermore, in thoracic aortic rings pre-contracted with epinephrine (EP) (10 \u03bcM) or KCl (80 mM), ALAE (0.250-1.625 mg/ml) showed a vasorelaxant effect. In isolated rat thoracic aortas, blockage of soluble guanylyl cyslase with blue methylene (P < 0.01) partially decreased this vasorelaxant effect. In addition, blockage of the prostaglandin synthesis pathway with indomethacin (P<0.05) also reduced the vasorelaxant activity of ALAE. Pretreatment of aortic rings with glibenclamide, propanolol, L-NAME, MLN-4760, or nifedipine did not affect ALAE-induced vasorelaxation.", "<i>Ammodaucus leucotrichus</i> is a prescient medicinal plant, able to act as an antihypertensive agent.
