We report the case of an adult male who presented to an isolated clinic setting with acute exacerbation of chronic liver disease. Medical management was complicated by limited transportation resources, both for supplies and patient movement. There was concern that the patient's clinical status could decompensate into a life-threatening illness that might not be adequately treated in this remote setting. Through the use of collaborative decision-making with the patient and by telemedicine consultation, the patient was successfully stabilized on the island until routine transport to a higher level of care was available. Knowledge of climbing systems and alternative transportation arrangements were integral to our ability to provide prolonged care for this patient in a remote setting. Knowledge of the use of medicinal plants was key in offsetting the side effects of other medications used. We are reminded that creative and collaborative problem-solving epitomizes wilderness and austere medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sutter Medical Group, Sacramento, California.
