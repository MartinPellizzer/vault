In recent years, the incidence of hyperlipidemia was gradually increased and showed younger trend. It has been a research hot point to study the etiology and pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and develop a new drug reduced blood lipid. It is very important to prepare the animal model of hyperlipidemia for displaying the advantage of traditional Chinese medicine characteristic. However, the success of replicating animal model of hyperlipidemia is one of the key of research in experimental hyperlipidemia. The ideal animal model of hyperlipidemia should be similar to human disease, high repeatability, simple and high generalization. It will affect the reliability of the results and the accuracy of the whole experiment process to copy successfully animal models of hyperlipidemia. This review focused on the recent research progress on copying methods of animal models of experimental hyperlipidemia, which will provide reference and basis for the hypolipidemic developers who choose rationally and effectively replication methods of hyperlipidemia animal models."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Hui-Ming", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yan-Chen", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources Protection and Genetic Improvement, Nanning 530023, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Qiao-Qiao", "Initials": "QQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China."}], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China."}], "LastName": "Pang", "ForeName": "Min-Xia", "Initials": "MX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325035, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Su-Hong", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China."}], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Gui-Yuan", "Initials": "GY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperlipidemias"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28929645", "10.4268/cjcmm20162002"]}}]}
