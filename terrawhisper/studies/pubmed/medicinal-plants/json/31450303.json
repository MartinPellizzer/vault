The characterization was completed by FE-SEM, TEM, and XRD, and finally these NPs were used for the ultrasonic-assisted adsorption of Basic Red 46 (BR 46) from aqueous solution. An experimental model suggested by the central composite design (CCD)-as a branch of response surface methodology (RSM)-provides insight into the influence of variables, such as BR 46 concentration, pH, adsorbent mass, and sonication time, on BR 46 removal. Experimental results revealed that setting conditions at 25\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> of BR 46, pH 5.0, 0.02\u202fg of Ce-TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs-AC and 4\u202fmin sonication resulted in a high coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>\u202f>\u202f0.99) and low probability values. The difference in the values is likely due to the accumulation of more than 99% of BR 46, while equilibrium data described by Langmuir isotherm model with a high adsorption capacity of 58.61\u202fmg\u202fg<sup>-1</sup> and adsorption process were successfully correlated with pseudo-second-order kinetics model."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
