The galactose-specific lectin from Viscum album (VAA), known to exhibit immunomodulatory and ensuing antitumoral capacities in animal model systems, was shown to aggregate human blood cells in the following order: neutrophils, mononuclear cells--thrombocytes and erythrocytes. To contribute to the analysis of lectin effects on individual aspects of the host defence system, two parameters of neutrophils were quantitatively assessed, namely the aggregating activity of VAA as a measure of strength of interaction with cell surface ligands and the effect of lectin on oxidative metabolism (H2O2 release) of these cells. It was found that whole lectin and its carbohydrate-binding B-subunit possessed the capacity to induce cell aggregation and H2O2 release, which were blocked by D-galactose and lactose. Both effects displayed similar dependence on the lectin concentration in the range 0.1-25 micrograms/ml. The toxic A-subunit displayed detectable activity only in high doses (50 micrograms/ml) while the bovine heart galaptin (14 kDa; galectin-1) failed to affect neutrophils. The role of oxidative metabolism in regulation of neutrophil aggregation induced by VAA was studied using metabolic inhibitors and controlled heating at 46 degrees C leading to inhibition of plasma membrane NADPH-oxidase system. Trifluoperazine and menadione inhibited the neutrophil aggregation in a dose-dependent manner in comparison with such inhibitors as amiloride and theophylline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics, Belarusian State University, Minsk."}], "LastName": "Timoshenko", "ForeName": "A V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cherenkevich", "ForeName": "S N", "Initials": "SN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gabius", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Pharmacother", "NlmUniqueID": "8213295", "ISSNLinking": "0753-3322"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J65BV539M3", "NameOfSubstance": "Deuterium Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Aggregation"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Deuterium Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Burst"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7647287", "10.1016/0753-3322(96)82609-6", "0753332296826096"]}}]}
