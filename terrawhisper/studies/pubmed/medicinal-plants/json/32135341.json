It has been reported that the isoliquiritin (ISL) from Glycyrrhiza root has the activity of promoting angiogenesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of ISL on the wound healing activity of zebrafish and its mechanism. 6-month-old zebrafish were injured in the skin (2\u00a0mm in diameter) and then treated with ISL. By measuring wound size and by histological examination, we found that ISL improved wound healing. In addition, 4-day-old zebrafish embryos of double transgenic line [Tg(fli-1:EGFP)]/[Tg(mpeg:mCherry)] were suffered from tissue traumas and then treated with ISL. Through fluorescent microscopy, we found that ISL promoted macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis in the wound area. Through qPCR analysis, we found that ISL up-regulated the expression of genes related to inflammation and angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos. These results showed that ISL could promote inflammatory response and angiogenesis, which played key roles in promoting wound healing. Therefore, ISL can be used as a promising candidate to promote wound healing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
