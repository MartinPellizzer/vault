Their absolute configurations of compounds 1, 2, 9, and 22 were elucidated by X-ray crystallographic analysis. These jatrophane diterpenoids showed lower cytotoxicity and compounds 3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 20 revealed promising multidrug resistance (MDR) reversal ability as modulators compared to verapamil (VRP) by MTT assay. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) exhibited that the absence of keto-carbonyl at C-9 and C-14 was essential to MDR reversal activity and the acyloxies substitution at C-5, C-7, C-8, and C-14 also made the activity difference. Euphosorophane I (4) particularly unfold greater potency (EC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01.82\u00a0\u03bcM) in reversing P-gp-mediated resistance to doxorubicin (DOX). As shown by fluorescence microscopy, 4 promoted intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 123 (Rh123) and DOX in a dose-dependentmanner than VRP. Flow cytometry indicated that 4 inhibitedP-glycoprotein (P-gp) -dependentRh123 efflux in drug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cells. 4 stimulated P-gp-ATPase activity in a concentration-dependent way and inhibited DOX transport activity. Western blot and real-time qPCR results further illustrated that 4 exhibited superior MDR reversal effect in MCF-7/ADR cells attributed to the activation of ATPase rather than the upregulation of P-gp expression and mRNA levels. In addition, 4 bond to the drug-binding site of P-gp predicted by the molecular docking analysis. Collectively, these results indicated that 4 efficiently reversed P-gp-mediated MDR via inhibiting the ABCB1 drug efflux function. 4 with the advantage of low toxicity and efficient could be used as an adjuvanttherapy drug for breast cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
