The first section, titled \"The Ottoman Concept of Waqf\", gives a brief account of waqfs, their roles and purposes. The second section under the title of \"The Translation of the Document into the Turkish\" constitutes our target research subject. The document examined was written by one of the M\u00fcteferrikas of the Imperial Court, Zaim Haci Ibrahim Agha, son of H\u00fcseyin. It is registered among the documents of the Directorate of Pious Foundations: 739/259/173, 739/253/157 and dates 1176 (Hijri calendar), 1762-1763 (Gregorian calendar). The document is about a medical dimension of the waqfs, which was not much encountered before. It gives the contents of a medicine in detail, which was stated to be good for eye diseases. The ingredients of the medicine and their proportional amounts are described clearly. Then, how to prepare the medicine is also explained with equal clarity. Referring to the written medical works, the pronunciations of the ingredients in the content of the medicine are given textually. The names of some ingredients, though legible, whose meanings could not be found, are given in Turkish transcription with a question mark. Hereby I owe great many thanks to Mevl\u00fct Cam, the Ottoman translator of the Directorate of Pious Foundations, who informed me about the existence of such a document."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Uluda\u011f Universitesi E\u011fitim Fak\u00fcltesi Ilk\u00f6\u011fretim B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc. oduzbakar@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "D\u00fczbakar", "ForeName": "Omer", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Z\u00e2im Haci Ibrahim Aga vakfiyesinde yer alan- ila\u00e7 terkibi hakkinda."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Turkey", "MedlineTA": "Yeni Tip Tarihi Arastirmalari", "NlmUniqueID": "9703828", "ISSNLinking": "1300-669X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "history"], "DescriptorName": "Eye Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 18th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Translations"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22164728"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
