Betel quid chewers have a higher prevalence of periodontal diseases than non-chewers. This study examined the pathobiological effects of arecoline, a major component of the betel nut alkaloids, on human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLF) in vitro.", "Cell viability, proliferation, protein synthesis, and cellular thiol levels were used to investigate the effects of human PDLF exposed to arecoline levels of 0 to 200 microg/ml. In addition, nicotine was added to test how it modulated the effects of arecoline.", "Arecoline significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. At concentrations of 10 and 30 microg/ml, arecoline suppressed the growth of PDLF by 20% and 50% (p < 0.05), respectively. Arecoline also decreased protein synthesis in a dose-dependent manner during a 24-h culture period. A 100 microg/ ml concentration level of arecoline significantly inhibited protein synthesis to only 50% of that in the untreated control (p < 0.05). Moreover, arecoline significantly depleted intracellular thiols in a dose-dependent manner. At concentrations of 25 microg/ml and 100 microg/ml, arecoline depleted about 18% and 56% of thiols (p < 0.05), respectively. This suggests that arecoline itself might augment the destruction of periodontium associated with betel nut use. Furthermore, the addition of nicotine acted with a synergistic effect on the arecoline-induced cytotoxicity. At a concentration of 60 microg/ml, arecoline suppressed the growth of PDLF by about 33% and 5 mM nicotine enhanced the arecoline-induced cytotoxic response to cause about 66% cell death.", "During thiol depletion, arecoline may render human PDLF more vulnerable to reactive agents within cigarettes. Taken together, people who combine habits of betel nut chewing with cigarette smoking could be more susceptible to periodontium damage than betel nut chewing alone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontics, Chung Shan Medical and Dental College Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.
