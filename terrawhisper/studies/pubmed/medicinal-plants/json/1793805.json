The resulting C-nitroso aromatic metabolites were examined by GC-MS methods to determine the extent of 18O incorporation. The arylamine substrates were p-toluidine, 4-chloroaniline, and 3,4-dichloroaniline. For both enzymes, all three arylamines were found to give quantitative incorporation of 18O into their nitroso metabolites when [18O]H2O2 was the oxidant substrate. The introduction of the oxygen atom into 4-chloronitrosobenzene was found to occur during the first step of this process, since it was found that when (4-chlorophenyl)hydroxylamine was employed as the substrate, no significant incorporation of 18O occurred. These observations prove that CPX and PSM cause N-oxidation of primary arylamines via an oxygen transfer from the compound I activated forms of their heme functional groups. Therefore, these peroxidases are correctly called peroxygenases when acting in such a manner. A discussion of the reaction mechanisms for peroxidases and their relation to cytochrome P-450 oxidations is presented."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Biochemistry, University of Hawaii, Honolulu 96822."}], "LastName": "Doerge", "ForeName": "D R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Corbett", "ForeName": "M D", "Initials": "MD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES 03631", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Chem Res Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8807448", "ISSNLinking": "0893-228X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitroso Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "20KR9WJ4NS", "NameOfSubstance": "3,4-dichloroaniline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Mixed Function Oxygenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.10", "NameOfSubstance": "Chloride Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.-", "NameOfSubstance": "peroxygenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I1D0KL7I4U", "NameOfSubstance": "4-toluidine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z553SGH315", "NameOfSubstance": "4-chloroaniline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chloride Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mixed Function Oxygenases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitroso Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Toluidines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1793805", "10.1021/tx00023a011"]}}]}
