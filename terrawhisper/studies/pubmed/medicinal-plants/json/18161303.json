Western blot analysis was performed to determine the levels of HDAC1 and P21(WAF1/CIP1) proteins, respectively. RT-PCR was performed to detect the level of P21(WAF1/CIP1) mRNA.", "The IC50 of concentration treated by Cur was 25 micromol x L(1) on HepG2 cell. The level of HDAC1 was obviously inhibited by Cur, and decreased at 4 hours at IC, and lasted for 48 h in a time-dependent manner. The inhibition of HDAC1 was significant at the Cur concentration of 12.5 micromol x L(-1) but there was no difference between 50 and 100 micromol x L(-1). The levels of P21(WAF1/CIP1) mRNA and protein were up-regulated by Cur in dose and time-dependent manner, and the change of mRNA and protein was detected at 8 hours and lasted for 48 hours.", "Cur can inhibit the level of HDAC1 and enhance the expression of P21(WAF1/CIP1) protein and mRNA, and the results suggest that inhibiting HDAC1 and increasing P21(WAF1/CIP1) may be one of the possible mechanisms of anti-cancer by Cur."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Bi-Hua", "Initials": "BH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Chang-Cai", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CDKN1A protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.5.1.98", "NameOfSubstance": "Histone Deacetylases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IT942ZTH98", "NameOfSubstance": "Curcumin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Curcuma"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Curcumin"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Histone Deacetylases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18161303"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
