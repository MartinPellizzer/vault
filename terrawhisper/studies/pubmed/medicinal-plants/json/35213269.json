Various investigations have previously revealed which medicinal plants play a role in the improvement of insomnia. In this study, we evaluated the effect of hydro-alcoholic extract of <i>Datura stramonium</i> on insomnia in mice.", "The extracts and fractions at different concentrations were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) to mice 30\u2009min before the sodium pentobarbital (30\u2009mg/kg, i.p.). Additionally, the blood was collected from cardiac and serum separated to measure brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The LC-MS was done to identify the active components. Flumazenil or naloxone were also applied to study the possible mechanism of extract. The PC12 cells were then exposed to different doses of extract and fractions, in order to evaluate cytotoxicity by MTT assay and the measured LD<sub>50</sub>.", "The hydro-alcoholic extracts of calyx, seed and petal elevated sleep duration and decreased sleep latency. In addition, water, ethyl acetate and <i>n</i>-butanol fractions of hydro-alcoholic extract of petal increased sleep duration. Of note, Naloxone significantly reversed the hypnotic effect of the extract. The extract increased the level of BDNF in serums.\u00a0As well, the toxicity assessment revealed that the extracts had not toxic on PC12 cells. The LD<sub>50</sub> value was obtained as 4.8\u2009g/kg.", "This research demonstrated that <i>D. stramonium</i> (including seed, petal and calyx) increased the hypnotic effect without neurotoxicity on PC12 cells.
