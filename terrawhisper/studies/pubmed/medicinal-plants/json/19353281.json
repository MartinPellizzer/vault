In 1995, the Ministry of Health, following the recommendations of the World Health Organization, established herbal regulations (RDC 17) in order to improve the quality of such products. In fact, only plant species with conclusive results from pharmacological and toxicological studies can be used for creating medicines. In this study, we evaluated the consequences of RDC 17 on the use and conservation of native medicinal plants by comparing the plant material used by six companies in 1995/1996 and 10 years later (2005/2006). Eighty-three different species were used in 1995/1996, 50 of them native (60.2%), 16 exotic (19.3%), and 17 imported (20.5%). In 2005/2006, 44 species were used by the companies and only 19 (43.2%) were native. The category of plant material that saw the largest decrease in use was roots, and in 2005/2006 leaves were more used. The study shows a strong reduction in the collection of native species signalizing the importance of herbal regulations on their conservation. It also points to the need for pharmacological and toxicological studies of the Brazilian native medicinal flora, as well as studies on their ecology and conservation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "DATAPLAMT-Museu de Hist\u00f3ria Natural e Jardim Bot\u00e2nico, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, 31270-901, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. mbrandao@ufmg.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brand\u00e3o", "ForeName": "Maria G L", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cosenza", "ForeName": "Gustavo P", "Initials": "GP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stanislau", "ForeName": "Ac\u00e1cia M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fernandes", "ForeName": "Geraldo W", "Initials": "GW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Science. 2002 Aug 9;297(5583):935-6", "ArticleIdList": ["12171086"]}, {"Citation": "Braz J Med Biol Res. 2000 Feb;33(2):179-89", "ArticleIdList": ["10657057"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 2009 Sep;156(1-4):567-80", "ArticleIdList": ["18726244"]}, {"Citation": "J Ethnopharmacol. 2008 Nov 20;120(2):141-8", "ArticleIdList": ["18762237"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 2008 Jan;116(1):A21", "ArticleIdList": ["18197282"]}, {"Citation": "J Ethnopharmacol. 2007 Mar 1;110(1):76-91", "ArticleIdList": ["17056216"]}, {"Citation": "J Ethnopharmacol. 2005 Aug 22;100(1-2):131-4", "ArticleIdList": ["16006081"]}, {"Citation": "Toxicon. 2001 May;39(5):603-13", "ArticleIdList": ["11072038"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19353281", "10.1007/s10661-009-0899-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
