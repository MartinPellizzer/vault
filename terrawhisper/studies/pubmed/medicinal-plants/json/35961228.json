The effect of melatonin application on enhancing plant stress tolerance has been widely reported, but the ameliorative effect of exogenous melatonin treatment on plants exposed to ionization stress is still unknown. This study investigated the ameliorative effects of two types of melatonin treatment, pre-sowing priming (prMel) and application during growth (ptMel), in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings exposed to different radiation doses (100, 200, 300 and 400\u00a0Gy) of radioactive cobalt (<sup>60</sup>Co) gamma rays as dry seeds. The growth parameters, photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll fluorescence, osmotic potential with soluble sugars, fructans and proline contents were then examined. The results indicated that high doses of ionizing radiation (IR) led to decreases in plant growth, pigment contents, chlorophyll fluorescence ratios and osmotic potential. However, soluble sugar, fructan and proline contents increased under IR stress conditions. Both melatonin applications, but particularly prMel, enhanced the morphological parameters, preserved the photosynthetic machinery and regulated the osmotic adjustment of IR-stressed wheat seedlings. Taken together, the findings show that exogenously applied melatonin, particularly prMel, play a significant role in alleviating IR stress in wheat seedlings."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.
