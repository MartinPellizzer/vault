These novel derivatives were further evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxic activity against five neoplastic cell lines (K562, HL-60, SPCA-1, Lewis, and L-1210) using MTT assay. Most of the target compounds (except for all these compounds against SPCA-1) exhibited more pronounced cytotoxicity against several neoplastic cell lines than that of the prototypical inhibitor etoposide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Analytic Center of Environment Engineering, Environmental and Municipal Engineering School, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Gansu Lanzhou, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Liu", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ying-Qian", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wen-Guang", "Initials": "WG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Xuan", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L36H50F353", "NameOfSubstance": "Podophyllotoxin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Podophyllotoxin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Podophyllum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17691049", "10.1080/14786410701371546", "781216382"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
