The different extracts of C. awdeliana were subjected to in vitro enzyme inhibitory assays of anticholinesterases (AChE and BChE) and anti-inflammatory (COXs and 5-LOX). The highest inhibitory activity was exhibited by DCM fraction against COX-1, COX-2, and 5-LOX with IC<sub>50</sub> of 4.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, 0.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, and 39.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively. The DCM showed also a moderate activity against AChE (IC<sub>50</sub> 384.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), and BChE (IC<sub>50</sub> 384.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). The repeated chromatography of DCM fraction resulted in the isolation of two new pregnane glycosides, namely awdeliosides A (1) and B (4), two known ones, namely caratuberosides B and D, along with the known flavone glycoside identified as luteolin 4 -O-neohesperidoside. All the isolated compounds were tested for their in vitro enzyme inhibitory assays. Among the isolated compounds, awdelioside B (4) showed the most potent effect against COX-1 with IC<sub>50</sub> value of 10.99\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.35\u00a0\u03bcM, compared to standard celecoxib (IC<sub>50</sub> 230.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.62\u00a0\u03bcM). All the isolated compounds showed weak anticholinesterase, except a moderate activity observed for awdelioside B (4) against BChE with IC<sub>50</sub> value of 15.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5\u00a0\u03bcM, compared to standard donepezil (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0088\u00a0\u03bcM)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
