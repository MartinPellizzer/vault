This study presents the first metabolome profiling of M. oleifera leaves of African origin using different solvent polarities via HR-UPLC/MS based molecular networking followed by multivariate data analyses for samples classification. 119 Chemicals were characterized in both positive and negative modes belonging to 8 classes viz. phenolic acids, flavonoids, peptides, fatty acids/amides, sulfolipids, glucosinolates and carotenoids. New metabolites i.e., polyphenolics, fatty acids, in addition to a new class of sulfolipids were annotated for the first time in Moringa leaves. In vitro anti-inflammatory and anti-aging bioassays of the leaf extracts were assessed and in correlation to their metabolite profile via multivariate data analyses. Kaempferol, quercetin and apigenin-O/C-glycosides, fatty acyl amides and carotenoids appeared crucial for biological activities and leaves origin discrimination."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
