The data have been discussed with respect to the effect of the coenzymes on the quaternary structure symmetry of the two enzymes and their binding isotherms. Both the (homo-tetrameric) apo-enzymes exhibit biphasic kinetics of thermal inactivation, characteristic of C2 symmetry, at lower pH values and a single exponential decay of enzyme activity, characteristic of D2 symmetry, at higher pHs. In each case, NAD+ has no effect on the biphasic kinetic pattern of thermal inactivation at lower pH values, but NADH brings about a change to single exponential decay. At higher pH values, NADH does not affect the kinetic pattern (single exponential decay) of any enzyme, but NAD+ alters it to biphasic kinetics in each case. The data suggest that NAD+ and NADH have higher affinity for the C2 and D2 symmetry conformation, respectively. With mung beans enzyme, the effect of NAD+ on the two rate constants of biphasic inactivation at pH 7.3 is consistent with a Kdiss equal to 110 microM. The NAD(+)-dependent changes in the kinetic pattern of thermal inactivation of this enzyme at pH 8.6 suggest a positive cooperativity in the coenzyme binding (nH = 3.0). In the binding of NADH to the mung beans enzyme, a weak positive cooperativity is observed at pH 7.3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India."}], "LastName": "Malhotra", "ForeName": "O P", "Initials": "OP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tikoo", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kayastha", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Srinivasan"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0310774", "ISSNLinking": "0301-1208"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0U46U6E8UK", "NameOfSubstance": "NAD"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Stability"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscles"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "NAD"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1294463"]}}]}
