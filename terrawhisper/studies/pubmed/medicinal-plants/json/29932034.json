As a complementary and alternative treatment, herbal medicines that are frequently used in the TCM are the most accepted in the Western world. However, animal materials, which are equally important in the TCM practice, are not well-known in other countries. On the other hand, the Chinese doctors had documented the toxic profiles of hundreds of animals and plants thousand years ago. Furthermore, they saw the potential benefits of these materials and used their toxic properties to treat a wide variety of diseases, such as heavy pain and cancer. Since the 50s of the last century, efforts of the Chinese government and societies to modernize TCM have achieved tremendous scientific results in both laboratory and clinic. A number of toxic proteins have been isolated and their functions identified. Although most of the literature was written in Chinese, this review provide a summary, in English, regarding our knowledge of the clinical use of the toxic proteins isolated from a plant, Tian Hua Fen, and an animal, scorpion, both of which are famous toxic prescriptions in TCM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Cellular and Molecular Therapy, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville 32611, Florida, FL, United States."}], "LastName": "Ling", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, Baoshan Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine, Shanghai 201999, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yuanhui", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Cellular and Molecular Therapy, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville 32611, Florida, FL, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, Baoshan Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine, Shanghai 201999, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Wenli", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "E-institute of Internal Medicine of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai Municipal Education Commission, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Ling", "ForeName": "Changquan", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Protein Pept Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "100960529", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2037"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Scorpion Venoms"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60318-52-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Trichosanthin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Scorpion Venoms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Trichosanthin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29932034", "10.2174/1389203719666180622100641", "CPPS-EPUB-91210"]}}]}
