The focus of this study was to simplify the purification procedure for removing many kinds of interferences in herbs, and to select adequate derivatization reagent for getting desirable selectivity and sensitivity in the quantitative determination of phytoestrogens. To satisfy these goals, we performed a solid-phase extraction with Oasis HLB cartridges following enzymatic and acidic hydrolysis, and we used the mixture of MSTFA/NH4I/DTE (1000:4:5, v/w/w) to form TMS derivatives of phytoestrogens. Overall recovery was more than 84% in all of the phytoestrogens, and the limit of quantification for phytoestrogens in herbs were set at 0.2 microg/g. Coefficient of variation percentages were in the range of 0.18-15.68% (within-day) and 0.23-16.61% (day-to-day), respectively. Most of the isoflavonoids and lignans were found in all of the herbs, but mycoestrogens were not detected at all. The Leguminosae family proved to be the richest source of isoflavonoids. Lignans such as enterodiol and enterolactone were detected at low concentration in most of the herbs. These results indicate that this assay is accurate and reliable for the determination of phytoestrogens in herbs. Also, information regarding the phytoestrogen contents in traditional medicinal herbs is useful in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases such as cancer, osteoporosis, dementia, and cardiovascular disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioanalysis and Biotransformation Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Cheongryang, Seoul, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Sang Hee", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Byung Hwa", "Initials": "BH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sun Yeou", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Bong Chul", "Initials": "BC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9010081", "ISSNLinking": "0955-2863"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytoestrogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "76543-16-3", "NameOfSubstance": "2,3-bis(3'-hydroxybenzyl)butane-1,4-diol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OL659KIY4X", "NameOfSubstance": "4-Butyrolactone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X01E7E1D6H", "NameOfSubstance": "2,3-bis(3'-hydroxybenzyl)butyrolactone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "4-Butyrolactone"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry Techniques, Analytical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lignans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phytoestrogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15302079", "10.1016/j.jnutbio.2004.01.007", "S0955286304000440"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
