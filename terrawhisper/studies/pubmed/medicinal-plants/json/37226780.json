Recent evidence suggests their anti-tumor potential against renal cancer.

The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were utilized to assess the strength of the association.", "A total of 6 studies with a total number of 2,364 patients were found eligible for the final analysis. The HR for the relationship between ACEI/ARB use and overall survival (OS) showed patients undergoing treatment with ACEI/ARB to have higher OS than non-users (HR: 0.664, 95% CI 0.577-0.764, p=0.000). Furthermore, the HR for the relationship between ACEI/ARB use and progression-free survival (PFS) showed patients undergoing treatment with ACEI/ARB to have higher PFS than non-users (HR: 0.734, 95% CI 0.695-0.794, p=0.000).", "The results of this review offer ACEI/ARB as a potential therapeutic option associated with improved survival outcomes in patients receiving anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Islamic Azad University, Mashhad Branch, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Saeedi", "ForeName": "Nikoo", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mansoori", "ForeName": "Saeide", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Asgharzadeh", "ForeName": "Fereshteh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soleimani", "ForeName": "Atena", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Islamic Azad University, Mashhad Branch, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic syndrome Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hasanian", "ForeName": "Seyed Mehdi", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "35"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37226780", "10.2174/1381612829666230524152108", "CPD-EPUB-132043"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
