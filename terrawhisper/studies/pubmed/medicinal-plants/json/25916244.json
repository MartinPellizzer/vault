However, its poor aqueous solubility restricts its application in functional food. In this work, 6-O-\u03b1-Maltosyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (Malt-\u03b2-CD), a new kind of \u03b2-CD derivative was used to enhance the aqueous solubility and stability of polydatin by forming the inclusion complex. The phase solubility study showed that polydatin and Malt-\u03b2-CD could form the complex with the stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. The supermolecular structure of the polydatin/Malt-\u03b2-CD complex was characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), thermogravimetric/differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC), and proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1) H-NMR) spectroscopy. The changes of the characteristic spectral and thermal properties of polydatin suggested that polydatin could entrap inside the cavity of Malt-\u03b2-CD. Furthermore, to reasonably understand the complexation mode, the supermolecular structure of polydatin/Malt-\u03b2-CD inclusion complex was postulated by a molecular docking method based on Autodock 4.2.3. It was clearly observed that the ring B of polydatin oriented toward the narrow rim of Malt-\u03b2-CD with ring A and glucosyl group practically exposed to the wide rim by hydrogen bonding, which was in a good agreement with the spectral data."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2015 Institute of Food Technologists\u00ae"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science, Henan Inst. of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, 453003, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Benguo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science, Henan Inst. of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, 453003, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Bioengineering College, Chongqing Univ, 400044, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Huizhi", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Bioengineering College, Chongqing Univ, 400044, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yonglan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science, Henan Inst. of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, 453003, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Mo", "ForeName": "Haizhen", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science, Henan Inst. of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, 453003, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Hanjun", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Bioengineering College, Chongqing Univ, 400044, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Guizhao", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0014052", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1147"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclodextrins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "G2-alpha-CyD"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Stilbenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Cyclodextrins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-Cyclodextrins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "maltosyl-cyclodextrin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "104723-60-6", "NameOfSubstance": "6-O-maltosyl-beta-cyclodextrin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "69-79-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Maltose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XM261C37CQ", "NameOfSubstance": "polydatin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calorimetry, Differential Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclodextrins"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Functional Food"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Maltose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polygonum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Stilbenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Cyclodextrins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "beta-Cyclodextrins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25916244", "10.1111/1750-3841.12845"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
