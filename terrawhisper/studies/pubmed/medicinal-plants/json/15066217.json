The location of NF-kappa B p65 subunit (NF-kappa B/p65) in THP-1 cells was detected by immunofluorescence and laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM). The expression of NF-kappa B/p65 in nuclei and that of I kappa B alpha in cytoplasm were measured by Western-blot analysis.", "The majority of FITC-labelled NF-kappa B/p65 was located in the nuclei being stimulated with LPS. Whereas, no such fluorescence was seen in the nuclei of the groups pretreated with alpha-pinene or control cells. alpha-Pinene pretreatment decreased the NF-kappa B/p65 nuclear translocation in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells, and this effect was dose-dependent, but there was no reaction in LPS-unstimulated THP-1 cells. alpha-Pinene pretreatment increased I kappa B alpha protein level in cytoplasm, compared with that in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells.", "In a dose-related fashion, alpha-pinene inhibits the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B induced by LPS in THP-1 cells, and this effect is partly due to the upregulation of I kappa B alpha expression."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Respiratory Drugs Research Laboratory of State Drugs Administration of China, and Department of Respiratory MEdicine, First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310031, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jian-ya", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Fa-di", "Initials": "FD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mao", "ForeName": "Guo-gen", "Initials": "GG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bian", "ForeName": "Ru-lian", "Initials": "RL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "I-kappa B Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NFKBIA protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factor RelA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "139874-52-5", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JPF3YI7O34", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-pinene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Eucalyptus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "I-kappa B Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia, Myeloid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factor RelA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Up-Regulation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15066217"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
