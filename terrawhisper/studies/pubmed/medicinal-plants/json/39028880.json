Opuntia dillenii (Ker-Gawl) Haw),</i> from Morocco using UHPLC/DAD/ESI-MS. Additionally, the study evaluates the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of these extracts. Thirteen phenolic compounds were found in <i>Opuntia stricta</i> extracts, such as flavonoids (kaempferol 3-O-arabinoside, isorhamnetin rhamnosyl-rutinoside, quercetin 3-O-rutinoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside, and isorhamnetin) and phenolic acid. The fruit peels were found to contain the highest phenolic content, protein, and total sugars. The antibacterial effect was investigated <i>in vivo</i>. The most active extract was the ethyl acetate extract of fruit peels and cladodes against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>P. aeruginosa,</i> with inhibition zone diameters of 16.2 and 15\u2009mm, respectively, followed by dichloromethane extract, with zone diameters of 13.8 and 14\u2009mm, respectively. Our results revealed higher antioxidant activity for the ethyl acetate and butanol extracts from fruit peels than cladodes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Natural Resources and Sustainable Development, Research Unit of Agro-Physiology, Biotechnology and Environment, Faculty of Sciences, Ibn Tofail University, Kenitra, Morocco."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Sustainable Development and Health Research, Faculty of Sciences and Techniques, Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakech, Morocco."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Agri-Food, Biotechnology, and Valorization of Plant Resources, Phytochemistry and Pharmacology of Medicinal Plants Unit, Faculty of Sciences Semlalia, Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakesh, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Elouazkiti", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Natural Resources and Sustainable Development, Research Unit of Agro-Physiology, Biotechnology and Environment, Faculty of Sciences, Ibn Tofail University, Kenitra, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Elyacoubi", "ForeName": "Houda", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Agri-Food, Biotechnology, and Valorization of Plant Resources, Phytochemistry and Pharmacology of Medicinal Plants Unit, Faculty of Sciences Semlalia, Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakesh, Morocco."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Agrobiotechnology and Bioengineering, CNRST-labeled Research Unit (AgroBiotech-URLCNRST-05 Center), Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakesh, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Gadhi", "ForeName": "Chemseddoha", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Sustainable Development and Health Research, Faculty of Sciences and Techniques, Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakech, Morocco."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Agrobiotechnology and Bioengineering, CNRST-labeled Research Unit (AgroBiotech-URLCNRST-05 Center), Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakesh, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Bouamama", "ForeName": "Hafida", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Natural Resources and Sustainable Development, Research Unit of Agro-Physiology, Biotechnology and Environment, Faculty of Sciences, Ibn Tofail University, Kenitra, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Rochdi", "ForeName": "Atmane", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39028880", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2381028"]}}]}
