Resulting from the ongoing 'natural experiment' well-conducted observational epidemiology can bridge the gap and determine whether, as consumed its use is of benefit or detrimental, for whom and when in the course of disease prevention or minimization of disease severity. The classic study designs (cohort and case-control) and the more recent development of case-only studies can be put to service for these purposes. The challenges are in dose assessment, understanding mechanisms of effect, determining the relevant time period of exposure for a given disease or symptom, controlling for confounding factors such as disease status, and the special challenges presented by irregular use of medicinal herbs and concurrent use of multiple products and multiple sources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.
