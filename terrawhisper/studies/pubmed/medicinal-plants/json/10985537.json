The extractants were water and propylene glycol. For comparison of the extraction methods, the yield was evaluated according to total alkaloid content measured by spectroscopy. The highest alkaloid yield was obtained by microwave extraction and by making tea. Distribution of the components was studied by thin-layer chromatography and densitometry. The concentration and the ratio of alkaloid components in extracts are significantly different depending on the extraction method. The solution obtained by supercritical fluid extraction contains coptisine and chelidonine, while berberine could be obtained by microwave extraction only. Extracts with high coptisine content were obtained by supercritical fluid extraction, followed by pressing and microwave extraction. Mineral element content of the drug and extracts was also determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. Element content (Na, Ca, Fe) was found to be highest in microwave extracts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Semmelweis University of Medicine, Institute of Pharmacognosy, Budapest, Hungary."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Then", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Szentmih\u00e1lyi", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00e1rk\u00f6zi", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ill\u00e9s", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Forg\u00e1cs", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Densitometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Papaver"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10985537", "10.1016/s0021-9673(00)00236-3", "S0021-9673(00)00236-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
