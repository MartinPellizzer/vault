Herb-drug interactions (HDI) can arise from the co-administration of herbal and orthodox medicines.", "This study assessed the potential for HDI of V. amygdalina, O. gratissimum, M. oleifera, A. indica, and P. nitida extracts using in vitro assays. Little is known about these medicinal plants' potential for drug interaction despite their extensive use in Nigeria for several disease conditions.", "The medicinal plant crude extracts were evaluated for Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme induction using cryopreserved human hepatocytes. Enzyme activity was determined by quantifying probe substrate metabolism and metabolite formation using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. The extracts were evaluated for the potential to inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity using human embryonic kidney membrane vesicles over-expressing human P-gp. The herbal extracts in vivo drug interaction potential was predicted based on the USFDA drug interaction guidance.", "O. gratissimum and P. nitida methanol extracts induced CYP1A2 enzyme activity by greater than 3-fold. P. nitida methanol extracts showed over 2-fold induction of CYP1A2 mRNA expression. O. gratissimum methanol extract induced CYP2B6 mRNA expression over 2-fold. P. nitida and A. indica methanol extracts showed potent inhibition of P-gp activity (IC<sub>50</sub>: 3.8 and 5.4 \u03bcg/mL), respectively, while V. amygdalina and M. oleifera methanol extracts showed moderate P-gp inhibition (IC50: 12.1 and 37.2 \u03bcg/mL, respectively).", "Our studies suggested that the medicinal plants' extracts can modulate CYP enzymes and P-gp activity with the potential to cause herb-drug interaction in vivo."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy & Biopharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria | Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, Rhode Island, USA."}], "LastName": "Amaeze", "ForeName": "Ogochukwu", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, Rhode Island, USA."}], "LastName": "Marques", "ForeName": "Emily S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, Rhode Island, USA."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacokinetics, Dynamics and Metabolism, Worldwide R & D Pfizer Inc., Groton, Connecticut, USA."}], "LastName": "Lazzaro", "ForeName": "Sarah", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacokinetics, Dynamics and Metabolism, Worldwide R & D Pfizer Inc., Groton, Connecticut, USA."}], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "Nathaniel", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacokinetics, Dynamics and Metabolism, Worldwide R & D Pfizer Inc., Groton, Connecticut, USA."}], "LastName": "Varma", "ForeName": "Manthena V S", "Initials": "MVS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, Rhode Island, USA."}], "LastName": "Slitt", "ForeName": "Angela", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P20 GM103430", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P42 ES027706", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P42ES027706", "Acronym": "NH", "Agency": "NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Metab", "NlmUniqueID": "100960533", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herb-Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "37"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34915831", "10.2174/1389200223666211216142904", "CDM-EPUB-119463"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
