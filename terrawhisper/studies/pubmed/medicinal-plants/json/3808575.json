As observed by phase-contrast microscopy, treatment of HTC cells with fermented or unfermented Iscador, at a concentration corresponding to 1 mg of fresh plant per milliliter culture, led to rapid lysis of cellular membranes. At a lower concentration, 0.1 mg/ml, unfermented Iscador led to the formation of polynucleated cells. On Molt 4 cells, fermented Iscador also produced cytolysis but after a longer time of action. Unfermented Iscador showed a much stronger cytotoxic effect on these cells than on HTC cells. Fermented Iscador was slightly more potent than unfermented Iscador in inhibiting the growth of HTC cells, but on Molt 4 cells fermented Iscador was less active than unfermented Iscador. DNA synthesis, measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation in HTC and Molt 4 cells, was inhibited by fermented and unfermented Iscador with the same type of differences of action as on cell growth. Fermented Iscador contained a low amount of lectins, approximately 100 ng/ml, while unfermented Iscador contained about 10 times more. A purified mistletoe lectin produced effects on HTC and Molt 4 cells similar to those of unfermented preparations. HTC cells were 100 times less sensitive to this lectin than Molt 4 cells. These results are discussed in relation to the known biological effects of lectins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rib\u00e9reau-Gayon", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Di Scala", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Beck", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Oncology", "NlmUniqueID": "0135054", "ISSNLinking": "0030-2414"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BK9092J5MP", "NameOfSubstance": "viscum album peptide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VC2W18DGKR", "NameOfSubstance": "Thymidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thymidine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3808575", "10.1159/000226418"]}}]}
