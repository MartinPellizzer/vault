An ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography method was developed for the determination of 11 chemical constituents from roots and aerial parts of <i>F. agrestis.</i> The separation was achieved within 7\u2009min by using C-18 column material and a water/acetonitrile mobile phase, both containing 0.1% formic acid gradient system with a temperature of 45\u200a\u00b0C. The method was validated for linearity, repeatability, limits of detection, and limits of quantification. The limits of detection of phenolic compounds were found to be in the range from 0.025 to 0.1\u2009\u00b5g/mL. The wavelengths used for quantification with the photodiode array detector were 238, 254, 291, and 325\u2009nm. Twelve of 17 dietary supplements contained phenolic compounds in the range from 0.3 to 2.7\u2009mg/d. The phenolic compounds were not detected in five dietary supplements. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with electrospray ionization interface method is described for the identification and confirmation of compounds from plant samples and dietary supplements claiming to contain <i>F. agrestis</i>. This method involved the use of [M\u2009+\u2009H]<sup>+</sup> and [M\u2009+\u2009Na]<sup>+</sup> ions in the positive mode and [M\u2009-\u2009H]<sup>-</sup> ions in the negative mode with extractive ion monitoring. The developed method is simple, economic, rapid, and especially suitable for quality control and chemical fingerprint analysis of <i>F.\u00a0agrestis</i>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA."}], "LastName": "Avula", "ForeName": "Bharathi", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA."}], "LastName": "Bae", "ForeName": "Ji-Yeong", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA."}], "LastName": "Raman", "ForeName": "Vijayasankar", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacognosy, Department of BioMolecular Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA."}], "LastName": "Fantoukh", "ForeName": "Omer I", "Initials": "OI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yan-Hong", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA."}], "LastName": "Osman", "ForeName": "Ahmed G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Zulfiqar", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacognosy, Department of BioMolecular Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Ikhlas A", "Initials": "IA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "U01 FD004246", "Acronym": "FD", "Agency": "FDA HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limit of Detection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rubiaceae"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30170324", "10.1055/a-0715-1801"]}}]}
