Also, their chemical structures were elucidated using UV-Vis, FT IR, <sup>1</sup> H NMR, <sup>13</sup> C NMR, MS spectral data, and elemental analyses. Subsequently, the anticholinesterase, tyrosinase, urease inhibitory activities and antioxidant activities of all chalcones were evaluated. The inhibitory potential of all chalcones in terms of IC<sub>50</sub> value was observed to range from 7.18\u2009\u00b1\u20090.43 to 29.62\u2009\u00b1\u20090.30\u2009\u03bcM against BChE by comparing with Galantamine (IC<sub>50</sub> 46.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10\u2009\u03bcM) as a reference drug. Also, compounds 2c, 3c, 4c, 4b, and 4d exhibited high anticholinesterase activity against both AChE and BChE enzymes. The tyrosinase inhibitory activity results revealed that three compounds (IC<sub>50</sub> 1.75\u2009\u00b1\u20090.83\u2009\u03bcM for 2b, IC<sub>50</sub> 2.24\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11\u2009\u03bcM for 3b, and IC<sub>50</sub> 1.90\u2009\u00b1\u20090.64\u2009\u03bcM for 4b) displayed good inhibitory activity against tyrosinase compared with kojic acid (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.64\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12\u2009\u03bcM). In addition, other different three chalcones (IC<sub>50</sub> 22.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.25\u2009\u03bcM for 2c, IC<sub>50</sub> 20.98\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\u2009\u03bcM for 3c, and IC<sub>50</sub> 18.26\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13\u2009\u03bcM for 4c) showed excellent inhibitory activity against the urease by comparing with thiourea (IC<sub>50</sub> 23.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19\u2009\u03bcM). Compounds 3c and 4c showed the best potency in all antioxidant activity tests. In light of these findings, the structure-activity relationship for compounds was also described. Furthermore, molecular modeling studies, including molecular docking, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET), and pharmacophore analyses of compounds, gave important information about the interactions and drug-likeness properties. As a result, all chalcones exhibited suitable ADMET findings, predicting good oral bioavailability."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2339-5837"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, K\u00f6yce\u011fiz Vocational School, Mu\u011fla S\u0131tk\u0131 Ko\u00e7man University, Mu\u011fla, Turkey."}], "LastName": "S\u0131cak", "ForeName": "Yusuf", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9466-3494"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Keke\u00e7muhammed", "ForeName": "H\u00fcseyin", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8088-6010"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Karak\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck-\u0130yido\u011fan", "ForeName": "Ay\u015feg\u00fcl", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0064-8400"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Health Sciences, Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ta\u015fk\u0131n-Tok", "ForeName": "Tu\u011fba", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6840-9660"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Oru\u00e7-Emre", "ForeName": "Emine El\u00e7in", "Initials": "EE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8932-4535"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Mu\u011fla S\u0131tk\u0131 Ko\u00e7man University, Mu\u011fla, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00d6zt\u00fcrk", "ForeName": "Mehmet", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Mol Recognit", "NlmUniqueID": "9004580", "ISSNLinking": "0952-3499"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.18.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Monophenol Monooxygenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.5.1.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Urease"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chalcones"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Monophenol Monooxygenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Urease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Jellinger KA.
