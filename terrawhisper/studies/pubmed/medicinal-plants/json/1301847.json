Qi Xue granule (QXG) was administered to 30 cases of treated group, while compound Salvia tablet (CST) was administered to 25 cases of control group. Besides, both group were also given one placebo tablet or granule so as to eliminate the patient's psychological effects.", "(1) Effects on clinical symptoms: Total effective rate for AP: 90% in QXG group, marked effective rate and effective rate for ischemic ECG changes were 30% and 46.6% respectively. All of these were better than that of CST group significantly (P < 0.05). Besides, QXG group could alleviate symptoms including asthenia. (2) Effects on submaximal paddle work load test: QXG group could prolong the capacity of exercise (from 336.2 +/- 34.7 to 437.5 +/- 43.8 seconds, P < 0.05), magnify the work load (from 73 +/- 7.18 to 94 +/- 8.5 W, P < 0.05) and elevate the ST segment (from 0.218 +/- 0.03 to 0.176 +/- 0.03 mV) significantly in comparison with CST group, which had little change only.
