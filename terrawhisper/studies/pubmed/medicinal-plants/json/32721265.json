Green tea, yellow tea, and black tea were combined with citrus maxima to obtain green tea and <i>Citrus maxima</i> (GTCM), yellow tea and <i>Citrus maxima</i> (YTCM), and black tea and <i>Citrus maxima</i> (BTCM). The biochemical components of these mixtures were analyzed, and their possible effects and mechanisms on relieving liver lipid deposition were explored. The tea polyphenols, free amino acids, phenolamine ratio, and caffeine were comparable in YTCM and GTCM, being significantly higher than those in BTCM. In addition, the content of esterified catechins, nonesterified catechins, and total catechins in YTCM was significantly higher than those in GTCM and BTCM. All three mixtures of <i>Citrus maxima</i> tea significantly reduced lipid deposition in HepG2 cells, with GTCM and YTCM being slightly more effective than BTCM. Regarding the possible mechanism, Western blot analysis revealed that the three <i>Citrus maxima</i> tea mixtures could activate the AMPK/ACC signaling pathway, upregulate the expression of p-AMPK, p-ACC, and CPT-1 proteins, and downregulate the expression of SREBP1c and fatty acid synthase proteins to inhibit fat synthesis, thereby relieving lipid deposition in liver cells. In conclusion, as a novel and healthy beverage, <i>Citrus maxima</i> tea has the potential to alleviate liver lipid deposition, and further could be responsible for obesity treatment."]},
