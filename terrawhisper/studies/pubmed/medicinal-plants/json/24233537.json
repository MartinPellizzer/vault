(Polygonaceae) gave rise to multiple shoots when cultured on a Murashige and Skoog (1962) medium (MS) with 2.0 mg/l 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 1.0 mg/l indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). Also, shoot buds developed from leaf explants using MS medium with 2.0 mg/l BAP and 0.25 to 1.0 mg/l indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) or IBA. Roots were induced when the resulting shoots were placed on MS medium with 1.0 mg/l IBA. Both regeneration procedures gave rise to healthy plantlets that were established in soil under glasshouse conditions at 80% frequency after hardening phase of two weeks. Regenerated plants showed a constant chromosome number of 2n=2x=22, same as the parent plant. The use of liquid shake cultures minimized the time and culture medium requirements for propagation. This procedure can be applied for the conservation and utilization of elite clones of R. emodi."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Plant Tissue Culture, Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, RSM Nagar, Post Bag No. 1, 226016, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Lal", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ahuja", "ForeName": "P S", "Initials": "PS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "9880970", "ISSNLinking": "0721-7714"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24233537", "10.1007/BF00269057"]}}]}
