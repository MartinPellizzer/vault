Today pharmaceutical chemistry and pharmacognosy are playing important role in treatment for a disease and its prevention. Herbal medicines are being used by about 80% of the world population mostly in the developing countries in the primary health care. There has been an upsurge in demand for the Phyto-pharmaceutical products of Ayurv\u0115da in western nations, because of the fact that the synthetic drugs are considered to be unsafe. Due to this many national and multinational pharmaceutical companies are now concentrating on manufacturing of Ayurv\u0115dic Phyto-pharmaceutical products. Ayurv\u0115da is the Indian traditional system of medicine, which also deals about pharmaceutical science. The Ayurv\u0115dic knowledge of the pharmaceutical science is scattered in Ayurv\u0115dic classical texts. S\u0103ranghadhara Samhita, which is written by S\u0103ranghadhara, explain systematically about the information of the Ayurv\u0115dic pharmaceutical science and also updated it. Industrialized manufacturing of Ayurv\u0115dic dosage forms has brought in new challenges like deviation from basic concepts of medicine preparation. S\u0103ranghadhara Samrhit\u0103 the devout text on pharmaceutics in Ayurv\u0115da comes handy to solve such problems, as the methods described are very lucid and easy to follow."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Indian Institute of History of Medicine, Osmania Medical College Building, Putlibowli, Hyderabad - 500 095."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Subhose", "ForeName": "Varanasi", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Srinivas", "ForeName": "Pitta", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Narayana", "ForeName": "Ala", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Bull Indian Inst Hist Med Hyderabad", "NlmUniqueID": "7510174", "ISSNLinking": "0304-9558"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Formularies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History of Pharmacy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17333665"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
