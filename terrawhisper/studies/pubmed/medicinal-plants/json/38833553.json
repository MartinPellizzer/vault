In this study, we engineered mitochondria-targeted nanodrugs (T4O@TPP/PEG-PLGA) utilizing terpinen-4-ol (T4O) as a natural antioxidant and mitochondrial protector, PEG-PLGA as the nanocarrier, and triphenylphosphine (TPP) as the mitochondrial targeting ligand. In vitro assessments demonstrated enhanced cellular uptake of T4O@TPP/PEG-PLGA, with effective mitochondrial targeting. This nanodrug successfully reduced oxidative stress induced by high glucose levels in vascular smooth muscle cells. <i>In vivo</i> studies showed prolonged retention of the nanomaterials in the thoracic aorta for up to 24 h. Importantly, experiments in diabetic VC models underscored the potent antioxidant properties of T4O@TPP/PEG-PLGA, as evidenced by its ability to mitigate VC and restore mitochondrial morphology. These results suggest that these nanodrugs could be a promising strategy for managing diabetic VC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The
