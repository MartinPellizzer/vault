Therefore, ever-increasing concern about synthetic chemicals has stimulated interest in eco-friendly compounds. Ferulago angulata (Schltdl.) Boiss. and Ferula assa-foetida L., as medicinal species with restricted natural distribution and unknown biological potential, aimed at investigation of their essential oil (EO) biological properties, were subjected. Z-\u03b2-Ocimene and Z-1-Propenyl-sec-butyl disulfide molecules were identified as the major composition of the essential oil of the fruits of F. angulata and F. assa-foetida, respectively. In vitro antimicrobial activity and membrane destruction investigation by scanning electron microscopy imaging illustrated that F. angulata EO had potent antibacterial activity. Besides, the EOs of both plants exhibited significant anti-yeast activity against Candida albicans. In relation to insecticidal activity, both EOs indicated appropriate potential against Ephestia kuehniella; however, the F. assa-foetida EO had more toxicity on the studied pest. Among several insecticidal-related targets, acetylcholinesterase was identified as the main target of EO based on the molecular docking approach. Hence, in line with in vitro results, in silico evaluation determined that F. assa-foetida has a higher potential for inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and, consequently, better insecticide properties. Overall, in addition to the antioxidant properties of both EO, F. angulata EO could serve as an effective prevention against microbial spoilage and foodborne pathogens, and F. assa-foetida EO holds promise as a multi-purpose and natural biocide for yeast contamination and pest management particularly against E. kuehniella."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
