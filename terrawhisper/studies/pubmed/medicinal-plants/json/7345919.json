Intraperitoneal administration of Chou-Mou-li produced dose-dependent hypothermia in rats at both 8 and 22 degrees C Ta- At 8 degrees C Ta the hypothermia in response to Chou-Mou-Li was due to decreased metabolism, while at 22 degrees C Ta the hypothermia was due to both decreased metabolism and cutaneous vasodilatation. There was no change in respiratory evaporative heat loss. Furthermore, the hypothermia induced by Chou-Mou-Li was greatly antagonized by pretreatment of animals with p-chlorophenylalanine (a selective depletor of brain serotonin), but not by either atropine sulfate (a selective blocker of cholinergic receptors), regitine (a selective blocker of alpha-adrenergic receptors) or DL-propranolol (a selective blocker of beta-adrenergic receptors). However, at 30 degrees C Ta, systemic administration of Chou-Mou-Li produced no change in rectal temperature or other thermoregulatory responses. On the other hand, direct administration of serotonin into the lateral cerebral ventricle of conscious rats also produced dose-dependent hypothermia at 8 and 22 degrees C Ta. Again, the hypothermia in response to serotonin was due to decreased metabolism at 8 degrees C Ta and was due to both decreased metabolism and cutaneous vasodilatation at 22 degrees C Ta. At 30 degrees C Ta administration of serotonin also produced no change in thermoregulatory functions. The data indicate that Chou-Mou-Li produces hypothermia by increasing sensible heat loss and decreasing metabolic heat production, probably via the release of endogenous serotonin within brain."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ho", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chandra", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hsu", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Am J Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7901431", "ISSNLinking": "0192-415X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "333DO1RDJY", "NameOfSubstance": "Serotonin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Temperature Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Serotonin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7345919", "10.1142/s0192415x81000184", "S0192415X81000184"]}}]}
