(Moraceae) is a medicinal plant in Asian countries including India and Thailand, possessing activities of anti-tumor, anti-allergy, anti-parasitic and anti-bacterial. In this paper, characterization, quantitation and similarity evaluation of cardiac glycosides in different parts of S. asper were investigated by HPLC-Q-TOF-MS and chemometric methods. Then, the inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity by the compounds isolated from S. asper was measured. Meanwhile, enzyme kinetics and molecular docking were determined to exhibit the combination modes between cardiac glycosides and Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. As a result, twenty peaks of cardiac glycosides were assigned. Strophanthidin-3-O-\u03b1-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1\u202f\u2192\u202f4)-6-deoxy-\u03b2-d-allopyranoside (1), glucostrebloside (2), strebloside (4) and mansonin (8) with a significant activity of inhibiting Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (IC<sub>50</sub> 7.55-13.60\u202f\u03bcM) were chosen for the determination of enzyme kinetics, exhibiting anticompetitive inhibitory characteristics towards Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Compound 4 could reasonably bind to the active sites of Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, proved by molecular docking. Furthermore, the contents of the major compounds in four different parts of S. asper were extremely different, analyzed by chemometric methods, similarity analysis and principle compounds analysis. All these findings indicated that the contents of major compounds in different parts of S. asper were extremely different with a significant activity of inhibiting Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, providing a reference for determination of effective part and administered dosage. The combination modes between cardiac glycosides and Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase were also revealed by enzyme kinetics and molecular docking, which provided a basis for further study of pharmacological activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
