We evaluated their neuroprotective properties in vitro for the first time using an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative damage model in SH-SY5Y cells. The results showed that pretreatment with maizediterpene D, a new ent-kaurane diterpenoid isolated from the EDEF, significantly attenuated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis by improving cell survival, reducing ROS production and increasing mitochondrial membrane potential. Mechanistically, the neuroprotective effect of maizediterpene D was confirmed to be related to the dual activation of IGF-1R and BDNF/TrkB crosstalk pathways. Our findings suggest that the EDEF and its active constituent maizediterpene D had good neuroprotective properties and could serve as potential candidates for the development of therapeutic drugs for oxidative stress-related diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
