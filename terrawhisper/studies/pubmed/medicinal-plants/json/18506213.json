However, their proarrhythmic potential is the most important side effect.", "In this research, we evaluated the potential cardiotonic activity of six new synthesized selective PDE3 inhibitors (6-hydroxy-4-methylquinolin-2(1H)-one derivatives) using the spontaneously beating atria model. In each experiment, atrium of reserpine-treated rat was isolated and the contractile and chronotropic effects of a synthesized compound were assessed. The 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a non-selective PDE inhibitor, was used for comparison.", "The results showed that, among new compounds, the best pharmacological profile was obtained with the compound 6-[4-(4-methylpiperazine-1-yl)-4-oxobutoxy]-4-methylquinolin-2(1H)-one, C6, which displayed selectivity for increasing the force of contraction (168 +/- 5% change over the control) rather than the frequency rate (138 +/- 5% change over the control) at 300 microM. However, C6 at concentrations of 10 and 100 microM produced left and upward shift in the positive inotropic concentration-response curve of isoprenaline. The -log EC50 of isoprenaline was 8.843 +/- 0.171 in the absence, 9.448 +/- 0.138 and 9.456 +/- 0.107 in the presence of 10, 100 microM of C6, respectively (P<0.001, n = 6). Also, amrinone, a selective PDE3 inhibitor, shifted the isoprenaline concentration-response curve to the left and upward. The concentration of 10 and 100 microM amrinone decreased -log EC50 of isoprenaline to 9.527 +/- 0.287 and 9.423 +/- 0.243, respectively (P<0.001, n = 6). Moreover, the positive chronotropic effect of isoprenaline was not affected by amrinone or C6.", "This study provides functional evidence for the positive inotropic effect of C6. Considering the augmentation of isoprenaline positive inotropic concentration-response with C6 and amrinone, we conclude that C6 produces its effect via potentiation of cAMP-dependent signaling system and possibly by inhibition of PDE3 activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mansouri", "ForeName": "Seyed Mohammad-Taghi", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shafiee-Nick", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Parsaee", "ForeName": "Heydar", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Organic Chemistry, School of Sciences, Ferdowsi University, Mashhad, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seyedi", "ForeName": "Seyed Mohammad", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saberi", "ForeName": "Mohammad-Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Organic Chemistry, School of Sciences, Ferdowsi University, Mashhad, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sadeghian", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Iran Biomed J", "NlmUniqueID": "9814853", "ISSNLinking": "1028-852X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "6-hydroxymethylquinoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiotonic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphodiesterase 3 Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.4.17", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.4.17", "NameOfSubstance": "Pde3b protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JUT23379TN", "NameOfSubstance": "Amrinone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L628TT009W", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoproterenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Amrinone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Atrial Function"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiotonic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Isoproterenol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphodiesterase 3 Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quinolines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18506213"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
