Acetylbergenin was synthesized by acetylating bergenin, which was isolated from Mallotus japonicus. The hepatoprotective effects of acetylbergenin were examined against CCl4-induced liver damage in rats by means of serum and liver biochemical indices. Acetylbergenin was administered orally once daily for 7 successive days, then a 0.5 ml/kg mixture of CCl4 in olive oil (1:1) was intraperitoneally injected at 12 h and 36 h after the final administration of acetylbergenin. Pretreatment with acetylbergenin reduced the elevated serum enzymatic activities of alanine/aspartate aminotransferase, sorbitol dehydrogenase and gamma-glutamyltransferase in a dose dependent fashion. Acetylbergenin also prevented the elevation of hepatic malondialdehyde formation and depletion of glutathione content dose dependently in CCl4-intoxicated rats. In addition, the decreased activities of glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase were restored to almost normal levels. The results of this study strongly suggest that acetylbergenin has potent hepatoprotective activity against CCl4-induced hepatic damage in rats by glutathione-mediated detoxification as well as having free radical scavenging activity. In addition, acetylbergenin doses of 50 mg/kg showed almost the same levels of hepatoprotective activity as 100 mg/kg of bergenin, indicating that lipophilic acetylbergenin is more active against the antihepatotoxic effects of CCl4 than those of the much less lipophilic bergenin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rhee", "ForeName": "G S", "Initials": "GS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Arch Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8000036", "ISSNLinking": "0253-6269"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzopyrans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "acetylbergenin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Benzopyrans"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Tetrachloride Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Epidermis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11339630", "10.1007/BF02976478"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
