In this study, we investigated the effects of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) ANRIL on learning, memory abilities, and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis via the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. After successful establishment of diabetic rat models, the subjects were then assigned into the DM, DM\u2009+\u2009si-ANRIL, DM\u2009+\u2009si-negative control (si-NC) groups, as well as an additional normal group. Morris water maze test was employed to assess behavioral performance of rats, followed by the recording of body weight and blood glucose levels. Expressions of ANRIL, NF-\u03baB signaling pathway-related, and apoptosis-related genes were examined by qRT-PCR and western blotting. Rat hippocampus expression levels of cleaved-caspase-3 were determined by immunofluorescence. Cell apoptosis was examined by TUNEL assay. Versus to the normal group, revealed there to be activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, decreased weight, increased blood glucose, increased escape latency, reduced residence time, memory impairment, increased cleaved-caspase-3 expression, and increased apoptosis were detected in the DM and DM\u2009+\u2009si-NC groups. The DM\u2009+\u2009si-ANRIL group exhibited inhibited NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, weight loss, decreased blood glucose, recovered memory, decreased cleaved-caspase-3 expression and reduced apoptosis compared to the DM group, with higher weight of rats, lower blood glucose levels, and stronger memory abilities in the DM\u2009+\u2009si-ANRIL group. Taken together, these findings indicate that silencing lncRNA ANRIL promotes memory recovery and decreases hippocampal neurons apoptosis in diabetic rats through the inhibition of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for
