Traditional herbal medicine (THM) has a long history of promoting wound healing, making them culturally accepted and trusted by a great number of people in the world. However, for a long time, the understanding of herbal medicine has been limited and incomplete, particularly in the allopathic medicine-dominated research system. The therapeutic effects of individual components isolated from THM are found less pronounced compared to synthetic chemical medicine, and the clinical efficacy is always inferior to herbs. In the present article, we review and discuss underlying mechanisms of the skin microbiome involved in the wound healing process; THM in regulating immune responses and commensal microbiome. We additionally propose few pioneer ideas and studies in the development of therapeutic strategies for controlled delivery of herbal medicine. This review aims to promote wound care with a focus on wound microbiome, immune response, and topical drug delivery systems. Finally, future development trends, challenges, and research directions are discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
