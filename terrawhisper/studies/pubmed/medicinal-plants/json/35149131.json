The anti-nociceptive activity was evaluated based on hot-plate latency, duration of paw licking induced by formalin, and abdominal writhing induced by acetic acid. Carrageenan- and prostaglandin-induced paw oedema models were used to determine the anti-inflammatory activity.", "The oral administration of AM, DS and WT root extracts displayed significant analgesic effects in the hot-plate test, both phases (early and late) of formalin test and acetic-acid induced writhing test at different dose levels. OI and DL only produced significant analgesia in the late phase of the formalin test and writhing test. The pretreatment of animals with the non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, reverse AM, DS and WT induced-antinociceptive activity. In both carrageenan and prostaglandin-induced paw oedema tests, all five herbal plant root extracts significantly reduced paw oedema at 3\u00a0h or more at different dose levels. Rotarod test results showed no effects of five herbal plant root extracts on the balance and the motor coordination at the highest dose level evaluated (400\u00a0mg/kg).", "The root extracts of AM, DS, and WT possess both central and peripheral anti-nociceptive properties, while OI and DL possess only peripheral analgesic properties. All five root extracts own anti-inflammatory properties, which might be due to their activity on the prostaglandin system.
