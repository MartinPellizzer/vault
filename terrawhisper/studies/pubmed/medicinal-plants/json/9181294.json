Areca nut chewing is popular in Hunan Province of China, and is more concentrated in Xiangtan City. Two and nine cases of oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) were first noticed in 1984 and 1985 respectively, and an epidemiologic survey was subsequently performed in 1986. The epidermiologic method of cluster sampling was used. The Yuhu District, one of the five urban districts of the Xiangtan City with a population of 100,000 was selected as a whole body in the survey, 57 independent units of various professions were randomly selected as group samples and more than 70% of subjects in each unit were examined. Definite fibrous band on palpation was used as a main diagnostic criterion for OSF. A total of 11046 individuals were examined; among them were 3907 areca nut chewers (35.37%) and 7139 non-chewers (64.63%). 335 cases of OSF were found, comprising a prevalence rate of 3.03%. The disease involved mainly the middle third of the oral cavity. All of the OSF cases were areca nut chewers. No case had been found in non-chewers. Four cases of oral carcinoma were found on the basis of OSF, the malignant transformation rate was 1.19%. The high prevalence of OSF may be due to areca nut chewing plus extensive and heavy use of hot pepper in Xiangtan people. The result supports the role of the areca nut as an etiologic factor in the development of OSF. The low malignant transformation rate of 1.19% compared with the 7.6% in an Indian report may be because Xiangtan people chew areca nut without tobacco."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Stomatological Hospital, Xiangtan City, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jian", "ForeName": "X F", "Initials": "XF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ling", "ForeName": "T Y", "Initials": "TY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Community Dent Oral Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0410263", "ISSNLinking": "0301-5661"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oral Submucous Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sampling Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Substance-Related Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9181294", "10.1111/j.1600-0528.1997.tb00918.x"]}}]}
