The adsorption function of D101 macroporous resin and the effects of sample concentration, pH, flow rate and eluant etc. were studied. Then the orthogonal design L9 (3(4)) was used to select the optimum purification process conditions.", "The appropriate technological conditions were as follows: the sample concentration was 0.5 g/mL, pH 6.0, the ratio of sample to D101 macroporous resin was 1:1 (W/W), 4 BV of water was used as purificant and 6 BV of 30% alcohol was used as eluant. Under these conditions, the average content of total flavonoids extract was over 60%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Fuzhou General Hospital of Nanjing Military Region, Fuzhou 350025, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Guo-rong", "Initials": "GR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Resins, Synthetic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Flavones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ranunculaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Resins, Synthetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Technology, Pharmaceutical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20034227"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
