Meanwhile,to establish a high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry(HPLC-ESI-MS) method for the simultaneous determination of 55 active components from 13 kinds of Ranunculaceae of Chinese traditional herbs. Samples were separated on HPLC system by Agilent 5 TC-C\u2081\u2088\uff082\uff09\uff084.6 mm\u00d7250 mm\uff0c5 \u03bcm\uff09column and eluted with acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid at the flow rate of 0.6 mL\u00b7min\u207b\u00b9. The data were performed by HPLC-ESI-MS with multiple reaction monitoring\uff08MRM\uff09scanning mode under positive and negative ion modes and quantified by external standards. The data from 13 Ranunculaceae herbs were analyzed by the PLS-tree and cooman's prediction of PCA and PLS to evaluate the similarities and differences of C. taipaicum in flavor and meridian tropism. The results showed that calibration curves of 55 components all showed good linearity, <i>r</i>>0.99,with good precision, repeatability and stability. After compared to other 12 herbs,PCA and PLS results revealed that the C. taipaicum belonged to lung and bladder meridians while its flavor attributive to pungent,warm in nature. In conclusion,the analysis approach of chemometric calculation combined with multi-components quantification is suitable for the classification of meridian tropism and flavor of Chinese traditional medicine,which can be used for alternative research of rare herbs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
