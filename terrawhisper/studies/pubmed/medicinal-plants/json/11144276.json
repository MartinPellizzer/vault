(cv. Redland Pioneer) seeds. However, the outward current showed time-dependent activation when higher sampling frequencies were used to measure the current. Activation of the current was best described as a double-exponential time course with the fast and slow time constants being 1 and 20 ms, respectively. The current also exhibited a rapid deactivation that followed a double-exponential time course with time constants of approximately 2 and 30 ms, respectively. \"Tail-current\" analysis allowed us to show that this current exhibited a low selectivity between K- and Cl- (PK:Cl = 1.8). Such a fast-activating current may account for some of the reports of time-independent, instantaneous currents that have been observed in plasma membranes of plant cells digitised at low sampling frequencies. Therefore, when \"instantaneous\" currents appear it is advisable to characterise these currents using higher sampling frequencies with correspondingly higher filtering frequency cut-offs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, The Flinders University of South Australia, Adelaide. wenhao.zhang@flinders.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "W H", "Initials": "WH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walker", "ForeName": "N A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tyerman", "ForeName": "S D", "Initials": "SD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Patrick", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta", "NlmUniqueID": "1250576", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0935"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["embryology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Protoplasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11144276", "10.1007/s004250000391", "10.1007/s004250000391"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
