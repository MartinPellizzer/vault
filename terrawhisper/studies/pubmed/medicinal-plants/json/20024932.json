For the carcinogenic effect, a genotoxic mechanism was considered possible, but was discounted by the European Food Safety Authority in 2004 based on new evidence. This allowed the derivation of a tolerable daily intake (TDI) for the first time, and a value of 0.1 mg/kg body weight was arrived at based on animal hepatotoxicity data. However, clinical data on hepatotoxicity from patients treated with coumarin as medicinal drug is also available. This data revealed a subgroup of the human population being more susceptible for the hepatotoxic effect than the animal species investigated. The cause of the high susceptibility is currently unknown; possible mechanisms are discussed. Using the human data, a TDI of 0.1 mg/kg body weight was derived, confirming that of the European Food Safety Authority. Nutritional exposure may be considerably, and is mainly due to use of cassia cinnamon, which is a popular spice especially, used for cookies and sweet dishes. To estimate exposure to coumarin during the Christmas season in Germany, a telephone survey was performed with more than 1000 randomly selected persons. Heavy consumers of cassia cinnamon may reach a daily coumarin intake corresponding to the TDI."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), 14195 Berlin, Germany. klaus.abraham@bfr.bund.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abraham", "ForeName": "Klaus", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "W\u00f6hrlin", "ForeName": "Friederike", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lindtner", "ForeName": "Oliver", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heinemeyer", "ForeName": "Gerhard", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lampen", "ForeName": "Alfonso", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Mol Nutr Food Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101231818", "ISSNLinking": "1613-4125"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavoring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "A4VZ22K1WT", "NameOfSubstance": "coumarin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards", "therapeutic use", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "standards", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Flavoring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphedema"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Venous Insufficiency"}], "NumberOfReferences": "53"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20024932", "10.1002/mnfr.200900281"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
