The list of plants, that were given, reflects the main approaches to phytotherapy of diseases of the cardiovascular system: this is the use of cardiac glycosides - the first highly effective drugs for the treatment of heart failure, P-active compounds, strengthen the blood vessels and regulate metabolism in the body, a variety of alkaloids, including stimulating the activity of the body, which is important, for example, in hypotension.
