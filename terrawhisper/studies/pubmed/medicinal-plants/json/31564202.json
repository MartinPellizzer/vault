Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21)/serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase-1 (SGK1)-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN). In addition, long non-coding RNAs (lnRNAs) participate in the development of DN, but the role of lncRNA LOC498759 in DN is still unclear. This study aims to investigate the role of Jixuepaidu Tang-1 in regulating podocyte injury and renal damage in DN and to validate whether the mechanisms involve TGF-\u03b21/SGK1 signaling and LOC498759. The drug treatment was initiated 2\u00a0weeks after the DN modeling. The MTT method and TUNEL staining were used to measure cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression of nephrin and desmin in podocytes. Sera from the Jixuepaidu Tang-1-treated mice reversed the high glucose (HG)-induced podocyte injury and EMT in mouse podocytes. Further <i>in vivo</i> assay revealed that Jixuepaidu Tang-1 not only reduced the ratio of the kidney to body weight, 24\u00a0h-urine total protein, and blood glucose, but alleviated glomerular mesangial extracellular matrix deposition and glomerular cell apoptosis in the streptozotocin-induced DN mice. Mechanically, the mechanisms of Jixuepaidu Tang-1 may involve the suppression of EMT by inhibiting the TGF-\u03b21/SGK1-induced LOC498759 expression. Collectively, Jixuepaidu Tang-1 attenuates podocyte injury and renal damage in DN, and inhibits EMT through suppressing TGF-\u03b21/SGK1-LOC498759 signaling."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Encephalopathy, Wuhan hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine , Wuhan , China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Examination, The central hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhe", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jianwu", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yujin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qianyun", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Quansheng", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cell Cycle", "NlmUniqueID": "101137841", "ISSNLinking": "1551-4005"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immediate-Early Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Long Noncoding"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transforming Growth Factor beta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "serum-glucocorticoid regulated kinase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "genetics", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "genetics", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Nephropathies"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Immediate-Early Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Glomerulus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Podocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Long Noncoding"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transforming Growth Factor beta"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ling L, Tan Z, Zhang C, et al.
