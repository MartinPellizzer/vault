In today's plethora, biomedical nanorobotics played an intricate character with numerous units of robots working at the pathological site in a coordinated manner. The synergistic action of the several nanorobotics has been employed for the fulfilment of the task such as large-scale detoxification, delivery of the large pharmacological/therapeutic efficacious payloads, etc. that is nearly unfeasible or unalterable practically by using single nanorobot. The collective intelligence of the nanorobot is advancing progressively at the nanoscale to reinforce their precision treatment potentially. Conclusively, after obtaining certain consideration regarding the nanorobotics sciences, many professionals are compendiously involving in the emerging highly efficacious therapeutic technology that encourages the scientist or designing of the tissues specific for the site-specific nanorobotic diagnostic devices. As a result, the closed and professional type between the field of Nanotechnology and Medical Sciences will provide another new highly oriented level to the domain of nanorobotics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2619-4643"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Sindhu", "ForeName": "Rakesh K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Kaur", "ForeName": "Harnoor", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6697-544X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Manish", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Sofat", "ForeName": "Moksha", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6504-4608"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Analysis and Control Laboratories Department, Turkish Medicines and Medical Devices Agency, MoH, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Yapar", "ForeName": "Evren Alg\u0131n", "Initials": "EA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hamidiye Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Health Sciences Turkey, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Esenturk", "ForeName": "Imren", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gazi Mustafa Kemal State Hospital, MoH, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kara", "ForeName": "Bilge Ahsen", "Initials": "BA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8640-4350"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wits Advanced Drug Delivery Platform Research Unit, Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, School of Therapeutic Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Pradeep", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5992-1291"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Keshavarzi", "ForeName": "Zakieh", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Drug Target", "NlmUniqueID": "9312476", "ISSNLinking": "1026-7158"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Nanotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Robotics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "24"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33641551", "10.1080/1061186X.2021.1892122"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
