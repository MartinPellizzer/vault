The 3 groups had varied dietary habits. Both the rural and urban poor mothers do not consume cow's milk. Black beans are consumed more often by the urban groups while soy bean products are consumed by both rural and urban poor regularly. Milk samples were collected from the mothers. The volume of milk produced in a 24-hour period was estimated by weighing the children before and after every meal. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) described by Sohe-Akerlund et.al. was used in quantitating milk secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA). A modification of the ELISA method was used to determine levels of specific IgA antibodies directed against cow's milk, black beans and soybeans. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used in statistical analysis. Comparable amounts of SIgA were produced by the 3 groups of mothers in a 24-hour period (p0.1). The urban privileged mothers exhibited significantly higher antibody levels against cow's milk (p0.01) and black beans (p0.05) compared to the other 2 groups. There were no differences in the level of anti-soybean antibodies among the 3 groups. The notion that antibodies found in the breast milk reflect the mother's intestinal antigenic experience is supported by this study. It has been suggested that anti-food protein antibodies contribute in the prevention of allergies. If so, cow's milk fed among the rural and urban poor children may be expected to produce negative reactions. This negative reaction can be prevented by feeding the mother, before delivery, cow's milk products to induce them to produce milk antibodies against cow's milk."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["005697", "00106211"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Americas", "Antibodies", "Biology", "Central America", "Clinical Research", "Demographic Factors", "Developing Countries", "Economic Factors", "Guatemala", "Hematological Effects", "Hemic System", "High Income Population", "Immunity", "Immunoglobulin Alterations", "Immunologic Factors", "Lactation", "Latin America", "Maternal Health", "Maternal Physiology", "North America", "Physiology", "Population", "Population Characteristics", "Puerperium", "Reproduction", "Research Methodology", "Rural Population", "Social Class", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Socioeconomic Status", "Urban Population"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "7196944", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1981", "Month": "11", "Day": "22"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "13"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0022-3476", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "99", "Issue": "4", "PubDate": {"Year": "1981", "Month": "Oct"}}, "Title": "The Journal of pediatrics", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Pediatr"}, "ArticleTitle": "Food antibodies in milk from Guatemalan women.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "600", "EndPage": "602", "MedlinePgn": "600-2"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cruz", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Urrutia", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Carlsson", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hanson", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Pediatr", "NlmUniqueID": "0375410", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3476"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin A, Secretory"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guatemala"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin A, Secretory"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Milk, Human"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7196944", "10.1016/s0022-3476(81)80269-7", "S0022-3476(81)80269-7"]}}]}
