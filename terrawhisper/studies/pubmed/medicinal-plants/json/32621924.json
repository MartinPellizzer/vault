AL-PSLs formulation was prepared, characterized, and evaluated in different pH media to simulate gastrointestinal condition. Osteoporosis was induced by 3\u202fweeks oral administration of MP (10\u202fmg/kg) and then treatment by PSLs, AL-PSLs, and alendronate (AL). Bone metabolic and biomechanical markers were measured in treated rat groups. Also, Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and histomorphometry were evaluated on bone tissues of treated rats. AL-PSLs were obtained in a size range of 155\u202fnm and negatively surface charge with an entrapment efficiency of 42%. The AL leakage from AL-PSLs did not exhibit a significant difference in acidic or basic media in comparison with the neutral condition. The concentrations of calcium, osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) of serum were significantly increased in PSLs and AL-PSLs treated groups compared to the MP group. Also, PSLs and AL-PSLs significantly improved the thickness and volume of the cortical and trabecular bone mass in treated groups. In addition, TRAP staining indicated a significant decrease of osteoclast number in osteoporotic rats treated with AL-PSLs and PSLs. In this study, AL-PSLs and even PSLs alone made a potential bone mechanical strength in glucocorticoid-induced bone loss more than AL in rats. In conclusion, our findings suggest that PSLs consumption with or without an anti-osteoporotic drug might be an applicable choice in control of osteoporosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
