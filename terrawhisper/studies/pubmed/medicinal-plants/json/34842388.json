A polybag experiment has been conducted at Bogor (Indonesia) to determine the effects on growth, photosynthetic and yield of various NPK ratios and manure fertilizer application in &lt;i&gt;J. gendarussa&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Six treatments (control: 50 g/plant manure, NPK (1.1 g/plant N:0.7 g/plant P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and 0.6 g/plant K), 50+50%/plant (manure+NPK), 10+50%/plant (manure+NPK) and 50+10%/plant (manure+NPK) were performed in a randomized complete block design. Data of individual plants were extracted from various treatments: plant height, number of leaves, number of branches, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic parameters, yield and sugar content were collected. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The plant treated with 10+50%/plant (manure+NPK) demonstrated a statistically significant increase in plant height, number of leaves and number of branches with the value of 59.00 cm, 85.00 per plant and 9.50 per plant, respectively. Chlorophyll a (0.538 mg g&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; FW), chlorophyll b (0.192 mg g&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; FW) and total chlorophyll (0.730 mg g&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; FW) were significantly improved by the treatment of NPK fertilizer. The application of manure and NPK at (50+50%) and (50+10%) was significantly increased stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, respectively. Leaves yield (9 g/plant DW) was improved by the application of 10+50%/plant (manure+NPK) fertilizer. The highest sugar content was obtained from &lt;i&gt;J. gendarussa&lt;/i&gt; growth with 50+50%/plant (manure+NPK) followed by 10+50% plant (manure+NPK) fertilizer. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; The &lt;i&gt;J. gendarussa&lt;/i&gt; plants could benefit from combined manure and NPK fertilizer application in growth, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration, transpiration rate, leaves yield and sugar content."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nurfitra Rahmah", "ForeName": "Nadhiya", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rafi", "ForeName": "Mohamad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Syukur", "ForeName": "Muhamad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nurcholis", "ForeName": "Waras", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101247723", "ISSNLinking": "1028-8880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manure"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indonesia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Justicia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manure"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34842388", "10.3923/pjbs.2021.1162.1168"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
