Although extraordinary efforts have been underway globally to identify safe and effective treatments for ZIKV, therapeutic progressions seem to remain stagnant, especially for treating congenital ZIKV infection. Bio-compounds from medicinal plants evolutionarily optimized as drug-like molecules offer eligible sources of pharmaceuticals and lead drugs to fight against viral infections. Here, we identified desoxyrhapontigenin (DES), a naturally occurring bioactive product, as the strongest inhibitory compound against ZIKV infection among six conventional polyphenols in vitro. We also leveraged the trophoblast cell line, human trophoblast stem cells, and complex placental organoid models to provide solid evidence to support the anti-ZIKV bioactivity of DES. Notably, DES treatment effectively reduced the ZIKV burden in serum and target tissues, and correspondingly improved ZIKV-induced pathologic changes including weight loss, tissue inflammation, cell apoptosis, and adverse pregnancy outcomes, while it did not lead to obvious toxicity in both adult and pregnant mice. Furthermore, mechanistic studies revealed that DES could suppress ZIKV entry via dual mechanisms of direct targeting ZIKV E proteins and downregulating putative ZIKV receptors. These findings elucidate a previously unappreciated protective role of desoxyrhapontigenin against ZIKV infection both in vitro and in vivo, which shed light on the development of a novel and potent treatment for congenital ZIKV infection."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
