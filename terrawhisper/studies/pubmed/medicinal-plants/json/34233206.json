Increasing resistance to existing synthetic anthelmintics used to control helminthosis and the unwanted presence of residues of the anthelmintics reported in meat and dairy products present a serious global health challenge. These challenges have necessitated the development of novel anthelmintics that could combat drug resistance and exhibit better safety profiles. Spondias mombin L. (Anacardiaceae) is a plant that has been used traditionally as a worm expeller.", "The aim of the work reported herein was to isolate and characterise anthelmintic compound(s) from S. mombin leaf, establishing their bioactivity and safety profile.", "Adult Haemonchus placei motility assay was used to assess anthelmintic bioactivity. Bioassay-guided chromatographic fractionation of acetone extract of S. mombin leaf was carried out on a silica gel stationary phase. The structure of the compound was elucidated using spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR) and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). Screening to exclude potential cytotoxicity against mammalian cells (H460, Caco-2, MC3T3-E1) was done using alamar blue (AB) and CellTitreGlo (CTG) viability reagents.", "The acetone extract yielded an active fraction 8 (Ethyl acetate: methanol 90:10; anthelmintic LC<sub>50</sub>: 3.97\u00a0mg/mL), which yielded an active sub-fraction (Ethyl acetate: Methanol 95:5; anthelmintic LC<sub>50</sub>: 53.8\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), from which active compound 1 was isolated and identified as phaeophorbide-a (LC<sub>50</sub>: 23.0\u00a0\u03bcg/mL or 38.8\u00a0\u03bcM). The compound was not toxic below 200\u00a0\u03bcM but weakly cytotoxic at 200\u00a0\u03bcM.", "Phaeophorbide-a (1) isolated from S. mombin leaf extract and reported in the plant for the first time in this species demonstrated anthelmintic activity. No significant toxicity to mammalian cells was observed. It therefore represents a novel anthelmintic pharmacophore as a potential lead for the development of novel anthelmintics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
