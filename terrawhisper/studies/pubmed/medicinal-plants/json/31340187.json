In this regard, lipid-based carrier system might have been regarded as prime delivery systems that are very close to the naturally cell-derived vesicles used for biomolecular communication among cells from occasionally remote tissues. Upon examination of the literature, we found a chasm between groups of investigations in drug pharmaceutics and thought that maybe holistic research could provide better information with respect to drug delivery inside the body, especially when they are going to be injected directly into the bloodstream for systemic distribution. While a collection of older research in most cases dealt with the determination of drug partition coefficient between the aqueous and cell membrane compartments, the link has been overlooked in newer investigations that were mostly focused on drug formulation optimization and their association with particle biodistribution. This gap in the literature motivated us to present the current opinion paper, in which drug physicochemical properties like drug lipophilicity/hydrophilicity is considered as an important element in designing drug-carrying liposomes or micelles. How a hypothetical high throughput cell-embedded chromatographic technique might help to investigate a nanocarrier tissue distribution and to design 'multi-epitope grafted lipid-based drug carrier systems' are discussed. Whenever we would need support for our opinions, we have provided analogy from hydrophobic biomolecules like cholesterol, steroid hormones, and sex hormones and encouraged readers to consider our principle hypothesis: If these molecules could reach their targets far away from the site of production, then a large list of hydrophobic drugs could be delivered to their targets using the same principles."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
