Recent studies showed that <i>Capparis spinosa</i> (<i>C. spinose</i>) exhibits potent antioxidant activity. So, in this study, we explored the protective effect of hydro-alcoholic extract of <i>C. spinosa</i> against DOX-induced cytotoxicity in H9c2 cells.", "Cell viability was quantified by MTT assay. Apoptotic cells were determined using flow cytometry (sub-G1 peak) evaluation of DNA fragmentation following PI staining. Cells were cultured with 5 \u03bcM DOX for 24 hr to induce cell damage. H9c2 cells were pretreated with different concentrations (6-200 \u03bcg/ml) of <i>C. spinosa</i> extract for 4 hr before DOX treatment in all trials.", "Pretreatment with 25, 50, 100 and 200 \u00b5g/ml of <i>C. spinosa</i> could increase the viability of H9C2 cells to 72.63\u00b12.8% (p<0.05), 77.37\u00b11.8% (p<0.05), 83.56\u00b12.6% (p<0.001) and 90.9\u00b10.5% (p<0.001) of control, respectively. Also, <i>C. spinosa</i> decreased apoptotic induction significantly, at the doses of 50 \u00b5g/ml (p<0.05), 100 \u00b5g/ml (p<0.01) and 200 \u00b5g/ml (p<0.001).", "Our results showed that <i>C. spinosa</i> could exert cardioprotective effects against DOX-induced toxicity that might be mediated via its antioxidant activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran; Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran; Medical Toxicology Research Center, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mousavi", "ForeName": "Seyed Hadi", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Azar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bakhtiari", "ForeName": "Elham", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran; Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rakhshandeh", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Avicenna J Phytomed", "NlmUniqueID": "101586220", "ISSNLinking": "2228-7930"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Aghel N, Rashidi I, Mombeini A.
