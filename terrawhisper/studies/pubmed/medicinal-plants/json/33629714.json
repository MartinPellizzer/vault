Some strains of this bacterium are reported to produce bacterioruberin type of carotenoids, which are generally produced by halophilic or psychrophilic bacteria. Since no other member of Rhodospirillaceae produces bacterioruberin type of carotenoids, we investigated the presence of genes involved in bacterioruberin and spirilloxanthin biosynthetic pathways in A. brasilense Cd. Although genes encoding the spirilloxanthin pathway were absent, homologs of several genes (crtC and crtF) involved in the biosynthesis of bacterioruberins were present in the genome of A. brasilense Cd. However, the homolog of CruF responsible for the final step in bacterioruberin biosynthesis could not be found. We also characterized the carotenoids of A. brasilense Cd using thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, absorption spectra and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Resolution of the methanol extract of carotenoids in ultra-performance liquid chromatography showed nine peaks, out of which six peaks showed absorption spectra characteristic of carotenoids. HRMS of each peak produced 1-14 fragments with different m/z values. Two of these fragments were identified as 19'-hydroxyfucoxanthinol and 8'-apoalloxanthinal, which are the carotenoids found in aquatic microalgae."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.
