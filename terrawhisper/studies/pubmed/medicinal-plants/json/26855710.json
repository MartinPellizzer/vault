The study was conducted to assess the in vitro antimicrobial potential and also determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Citrus sinensis peel extracts with a view of searching a novel extract as a remedy for dental caries pathogens.", "Aqueous and ethanol (cold and hot) extracts prepared from peel of Citrus sinensis were screened for in vitro antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus, using agar well diffusion method. The lowest concentration of every extract considered as the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined for both test organisms. One way ANOVA with Post Hoc Bonferroni test was applied for statistical analysis. Confidence level and level of significance were set at 95% and 5% respectively.", "Dental caries pathogens were inhibited most by hot ethanolic extract of Citrus sinensispeel followed by cold ethanolic extract. Aqueous extracts were effective at very high concentrations. Minimum inhibitory concentration of hot and cold ethanolic extracts of Citrus sinensis peel ranged between 12-15 mg/ml against both the dental caries pathogens.", "Citrus sinensispeels extract was found to be effective against dental caries pathogens and contain compounds with therapeutic potential. Nevertheless, clinical trials on the effect of these plants are essential before advocating large-scale therapy.", "Agar well diffusion, antimicrobial activity, dental caries, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Senior Lecturer, Sharavathi Dental College and Hospital, Shimoga, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Shetty", "ForeName": "Sapna B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Assistant Professor, Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, IBN Sina National College of Medical Studies, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Mahin-Syed-Ismail", "ForeName": "Prabu", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Professor, Department of Orthodontics, P.S.M College of Dental Sciences and Research, Akkikavu, Thrissur, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Varghese", "ForeName": "Shaji", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Associate Professor, Department of Periodontics, IBN Sina National College of Medical Studies, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Thomas-George", "ForeName": "Bibin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Professor and HOD, Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, P.S.M College of Dental Sciences and Research, Akkikavu, Thrissur, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Kandathil-Thajuraj", "ForeName": "Pathinettam", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Reader, Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, P.S.M College of Dental Sciences and Research, Akkikavu, Thrissur, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Baby", "ForeName": "Deepak", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Post Graduate Student, Department of Aesthetic and Restorative Dentistry, University of Manchester, London, UK."}], "LastName": "Haleem", "ForeName": "Shaista", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Reader, Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, Sri Shankara Dental College and Hospital, Varkala, Trivandrum, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Sreedhar", "ForeName": "Sreeja", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dental Biomaterials Research Chair, Dental Health Department, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh 11433, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Devang-Divakar", "ForeName": "Darshan", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Spain", "MedlineTA": "J Clin Exp Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "101603132", "ISSNLinking": "1989-5488"}, "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflict of interest statement:</b>None."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Hotwani K, Baliga S, Sharma K.
