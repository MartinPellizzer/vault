The percentage of inhibition was 24% for IL-2, 72% for INF-gamma and 53% for TNF-alpha. With regard to Th2 cytokines, the addition of PLE resulted in a significant increase (33%) in IL-10 production. Surprisingly, the production of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was completely abolished (100% inhibition) by PLE at all doses tested. In a second experiment in vivo we show that, the topical application of PLE to the skin of hairless albino mice (Skh-1) significantly diminished the mast cell infiltrate as well as the number of blood vessels triggered by chronic ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation. These data show that PLE moderately inhibits the immunological Th1 responses, thus explaining the immunosuppressive as well as the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities reported in other studies carried out with PLE. The clear inhibitory effect on TFN-alpha and IL-6 production strongly suggest that this may be the mechanism by which PLE: (a) inhibits angiogenesis in vivo in the mouse model described here, and (b) prevents Langerhans' cells depletion caused by solar irradiation in humans. Taken together, these data suggest that PLE works through the induction of suppressive/anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and/or TGF-beta which in turn appear to allow the partial deactivation of macrophages or other accessory cells. These features suggest that PLE could be useful in the treatment of autoaggressive/inflammatory conditions due to an exacerbation of Th1 responses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wellman Laboratories of Photomedicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonzalez", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alcaraz", "ForeName": "M V", "Initials": "MV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cuevas", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Perez", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jaen", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alvarez-Mon", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Villarrubia", "ForeName": "V G", "Initials": "VG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8102988", "ISSNLinking": "0250-7005"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Angiogenesis Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Angiogenesis Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes, Mononuclear"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Hairless"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Radiodermatitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Th1 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Th2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10928072"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
