Despite recent advancements in understanding the mechanisms involved in atopic dermatitis, current marketed products have shown varying results with more side effects. The present ob-jective of the research studies is to develop new agents for eczema that cut down the cost of the novel drugs available and also improve the efficacy with the least adverse effects. Natural compounds and medicinal plants have been traditionally used since ancient civilizations. Now-adays, research in the herbal field is at its peak. One such natural compound, flavonoid, was found to be beneficial for the treatment of eczema. This review describes the use of certain flavonoid products to prepare preparations suitable for the treatment of prophylaxis or eczema. This is especially true for prophylaxis or atopic eczema treatment. These compounds exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and anti-inflammatory properties and are, therefore, used in treatments to prevent allergies, inflammation, and irritation to the skin. We also dock the flavonoid derivatives used with the protein associated with the inhibi-tion of eczema for better lead optimization. These preparations appear to be used for cosmetic, dermatological, or herbal remedies as a local application."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0120-2814"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, School of Medical and Allied Sciences, Galgotias University, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Javed", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2816-8273"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, School of Medical and Allied Sciences, Galgotias University, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Yadav", "ForeName": "Shikha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2816-8273"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, School of Medical and Allied Sciences, Galgotias University, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Bhardwaj", "ForeName": "Divya", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0120-2814"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, School of Medical and Allied Sciences, Galgotias University, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Abhishek", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0120-2814"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, School of Medical and Allied Sciences, Galgotias University, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Okanlawon", "ForeName": "Moshood Ummuani", "Initials": "MU"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Antiinflamm Antiallergy Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101462262", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5230"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38721791", "10.2174/0118715230299752240310171954", "AIAAMC-EPUB-140241"]}}]}
