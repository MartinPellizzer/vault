This level of protein was found to be safe for preschool children in an earlier short-term N balance study. Continuous N balance was determined for 70 d in three subjects and 45 d in two subjects. All the subjects were found to be in steady positive N balance throughout the experimental period, the mean daily N retention varying between 54.5 and 87.5 mg/d. All the children increased their body weight steadily over the experimental period. No tendency of N balance to decrease with time was observed. It is concluded that the safe level of protein for preschool children estimated from a short-term N balance study is quite adequate when tested by a long-term feeding trial."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Iyengar", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Narasinga Rao", "ForeName": "B S", "Initials": "BS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hum Nutr Clin Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8207516", "ISSNLinking": "0263-8290"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Intake"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Growth"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritional Requirements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6687723"]}}]}
