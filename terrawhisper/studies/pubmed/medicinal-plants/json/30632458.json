Studies have shown that miRNAs regulate the processes related to osteoporosis, including the differentiation of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and chondrocytes, and are one of the important regulatory factors of some bone metabolic diseases. In our previous study, it has been revealed that natural compound <i>Polygonatum sibiricum</i> polysaccharide (PSP) can promote osteoblast formation and block osteoclastogenesis through Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. This study was designed to investigate whether PSP can inhibit expression of osteoclast-related genes by Hippo signaling pathway, which was prevented by effectively blocking the expression of miR-1224. This study showed that there were 27 differentially expressed miRNAs when PSP inhibits osteoclastogenesis, the most notable of which was miR-1224. Furthermore, the study showed that PSP increased the level of Limd1, which was the target gene of miR-1224. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that PSP suppressed osteoclastogenesis <i>in vitro</i> through the Hippo signaling pathway based on miR-1224. This study may aid in the development of a therapeutic approach utilizing PSP for the enhancement of bone health and prevention of osteoporosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
