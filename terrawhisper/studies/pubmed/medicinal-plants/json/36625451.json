Additional evidence supports its exploitation for medicinal purposes in the ancient world. The cultivation of cannabis gradually declined as hemp fibers gave way to synthetic fibers, while the intoxicating ability of THC eventually overshadowed the extensive potential of cannabis. Nevertheless, the proven value of certain non-intoxicating cannabinoids, such as CBD and CBN, has recently given rise to an entire market which promotes cannabis-based products. An increase in the research for recovery and exploitation of beneficial cannabinoids has also been observed, with more than 10\u2009000 peer-reviewed research articles published annually. In the present review, a brief overview of the history of cannabis is given. A look into the classification approaches of cannabis plants/species as well as the associated nomenclature is provided, followed by a description of their chemical characteristics and their medically valuable components. The application areas could not be absent from the present review. Still, the main focus of the review is the discussion of work conducted in the field of extraction of valuable bioactive compounds from cannabis. We conclude with a summary of the current status and outlook on the topics that future research should address."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0011-2793"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Synthetic Chemistry, TU Wien, Getreidemarkt 9/163, Vienna, Austria. katharina.schroeder@tuwien.ac.at."}], "LastName": "Sainz Martinez", "ForeName": "Aitor", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6157-5559"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Synthetic Chemistry, TU Wien, Getreidemarkt 9/163, Vienna, Austria. katharina.schroeder@tuwien.ac.at."}], "LastName": "Lanaridi", "ForeName": "Olga", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Synthetic Chemistry, TU Wien, Getreidemarkt 9/163, Vienna, Austria. katharina.schroeder@tuwien.ac.at."}], "LastName": "Stagel", "ForeName": "Kristof", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9059-5850"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chemical, Environmental and Bioscience Engineering, TU Wien, Getreidemarkt 9/166, Vienna, Austria."}], "LastName": "Halbwirth", "ForeName": "Heidi", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2946-9294"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Synthetic Chemistry, TU Wien, Getreidemarkt 9/163, Vienna, Austria. katharina.schroeder@tuwien.ac.at."}], "LastName": "Schn\u00fcrch", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2515-9873"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Synthetic Chemistry, TU Wien, Getreidemarkt 9/163, Vienna, Austria. katharina.schroeder@tuwien.ac.at."}], "LastName": "Bica-Schr\u00f6der", "ForeName": "Katharina", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "8502408", "ISSNLinking": "0265-0568"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cannabinoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cannabinoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cannabis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36625451", "10.1039/d2np00059h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
