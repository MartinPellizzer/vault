Nevertheless, little work has been done to clarify the detailed mechanism of hepatoprotective effects of PSPC. This study was designed to explore whether PSPC protected mouse liver from d-gal-induced injury by attenuating oxidative stress or suppressing inflammation. The histology changes of mouse liver was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The results showed that PSPC could effectively suppress the d-gal-induced histology changes including structure damage and leucocyte infiltration in mouse liver. Oxidative stress and antioxidant status in mouse liver were also analysed. The results showed that PSPC could largely attenuate the d-gal-induced MDA increasing and could markedly renew the activities of Cu, Zn-SOD, CAT and GPx in the livers of d-gal-treated mice. Furthermore, the results of western blot analysis showed that PSPC could inhibit the upregulation of the expression of NF-kappaB p65, COX-2 and iNOS caused by d-gal. In conclusion, our data suggested that PSPC could protect the mouse liver from d-gal-induced injury by attenuating lipid peroxidation, renewing the activities of antioxidant enzymes and suppressing inflammatory response. This study provided novel insights into the mechanisms of PSPC in the protection of the liver."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Biotechnology on Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Science, Xuzhou Normal University, No. 101, Shanghai Road, Tangshan New Area, Xuzhou City 221116, Jiangsu Province, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zi-Feng", "Initials": "ZF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Shao-Hua", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Yuan-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Dong-Mei", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shan", "ForeName": "Qun", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8207483", "ISSNLinking": "0278-6915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X2RN3Q8DNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Galactose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemoprevention"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Galactose"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ipomoea batatas"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19114082", "10.1016/j.fct.2008.12.005", "S0278-6915(08)00687-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
