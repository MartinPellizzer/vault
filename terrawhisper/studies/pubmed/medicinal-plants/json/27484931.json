Poikilacanthus glandulosus is widely used by the population of City of Santiago, in Brazil, nevertheless, it does not have any validation regarding its use and its medicinal effects.", "The objective of this study was to perform one ethnopharmacological survey about P. glandulosus in the City of Santiago and determine the anti-inflammatory activity in order to prove its uses in popular medicine.", "Personal and ethnopharmacological data were collected through a prepared questionnaire. The phytochemical analysis was performed observing the individual methodology for each reaction and by HPLC-UV. The antiedematogenic and anti-inflammatory (cell infiltration and histological procedure) activities of the P. glandulosus (0.01-1000\u03bcg/ear) were evaluated in the ear edema model induced by topical application of croton oil.", "P. glandulosus is known in City of Santiago as \"Gaiana\" and its macerated leaves and branches are prepared with alcohol or sugarcane liquor especially for insect bites, cicatrization and inflammation. HPLC analysis revealed the presence of maslinic acid (2.024\u00b10.10mg/g), uvaol (0.124\u00b10.02mg/g) and sitosterol (0.502\u00b10.05mg/g). The topical application of crude extract of P. glandulosus reduced in a dose-dependent manner the croton oil-induced ear edema and myeloperoxidase activity (neutrophils infiltration marker) with maximum inhibition of 87\u00b12% and 64\u00b112%, respectively at 1000\u00b5g/ear. Dexamethasone (100\u00b5g/ear), used as a positive control, inhibited croton oil-induced ear edema in 89\u00b13% and decreased myeloperoxidase activity in 50\u00b13%. Both P. glandulosus as dexamethasone reduced cell infiltration when evaluated by histological procedure CONCLUSION: This work allowed us to understand the specie P. glandulosus through ethnopharmacological study and it showed that the crude extract presented antiedematogenic and anti-inflammatory actions, proving their traditional use as anti-inflammatory."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
