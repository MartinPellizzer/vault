Fifty to 800 mg/kg of this fraction reduced motor activity and anesthetized mice; it also protected the animals against transcorneal electroshock. A hydrolate obtained from the powder, contained 0.2 mg of essential oil fraction per ml: 0.1 and 0.2 ml/10 g of this hydrolate reduced motor activity and potentiated barbiturate sleeping time of mice; 2.5-10 ml/kg given to rats produced a drop in body temperature. The hydrolate, however, did not anesthetize and did not protect mice against convulsions induced by electrical shock. These amounts of the hydrolate corresponded to dosing the animals with 2-4 mg/kg of the essential oil (or 1-2 mg/kg of safrol), doses which were inactive per se. This suggested that the pharmacological activity of the hydrolate was not due to its essential oil content. Corroborating this possibility the hydrosoluble portion of the hydrolate mimicked all of its effects: reduced motor activity, potentiated barbiturate sleeping time of mice and decreased body temperature of rats. The hydrosoluble material, as the hydrolate, was also incapable of anesthetizing and protecting mice against electroshock induced convulsions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Carlini", "ForeName": "E A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "de Oliveira", "ForeName": "A B", "Initials": "AB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "de Oliveira", "ForeName": "G G", "Initials": "GG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Reflex"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6645572", "10.1016/0378-8741(83)90056-9", "0378-8741(83)90056-9"]}}]}
