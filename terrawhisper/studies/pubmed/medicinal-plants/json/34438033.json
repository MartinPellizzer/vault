Their fruits and seeds are valuable traditional medicine and used extensively, particularly in South China, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The genus Amomum has long been used for treating gastric diseases, digestive disorder, cancer, hepatopathy, malaria, etc. AIMS OF THE REVIEW: The main purpose of this review is to provide the available information on the traditional medicinal uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacology aspects of the genus Amomum in order to explore the trends and perspectives for further studies on its non-volatile constituents.", "The present review collected the literatures published prior to 2020 on the traditional medicinal uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacology of the genus Amomum. The available literatures were extracted from scientific databases, such as Sci-finder, PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Baidu Scholar, and CNKI, books, and others.", "Herein, we summarize all 166 naturally occurring non-volatile compounds from 16 plants of the genus Amomum reported in 171 references, including flavonoids, terpenoids, diarylheptanoids, coumarins, etc. Triterpenes and flavonoids are the main constituents among these compounds and maybe play an important role in the activities directly or indirectly. As traditional medicine, the plants from the genus Amomum have been usually used in some traditional herbal prescriptions, and pharmacological researches in vitro and in vivo revealed that the extracts possessed significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic activities, etc. CONCLUSION: The review systematically summarizes current studies on traditional medicinal uses, phytochemistry, pharmacological activity on the plants from the genus Amomum. To date, the majority of publications still focused on the research of volatile constituents. However, the promising preliminary data of non-volatile constituents indicated the research potential of this genus in phytochemical and pharmacological aspects. Furthermore, the further in-depth investigations on the safety, efficacy, as well as the stereo-chemistry and structure-activity relationships of pure compounds from this genus are essential in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
