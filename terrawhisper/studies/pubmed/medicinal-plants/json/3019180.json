Human spermatozoa were incubated in Bakers buffer, 1 million/ml at 37 degrees C. for 30 minutes in the presence of 100 mc gossypol. Gossypol was dissolved in ethanol and diluted to 0.01% with distilled water, then 0.01 ml was added to 1.0 ml spermatozoa. Controls contained 0.1 ml of 0.01% ethyl acetate. Gossypol reduced motility from a range of 66.1 to 79.4% to a range of 32.1 to 38.1% (p0.01). Washing the spermatozoa by centrifuging twice at 343 x g for 10 min. and reincubating in a buffer had no effect on motility. Addition of the sperm motility stimulating agents theophylline 10 mM, kallikrein 100 KIU or dibutyryl-caMP after washing away the gossypol restored motility to 55.1%, 58.7% and 50.0%, respectively (p0.01)."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["044966", "00175512"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: ANDROLOGIA."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Adenosine Cyclic Monophosphate", "Asia", "Biology", "Clinical Research", "Contraception", "Contraceptive Agents", "Contraceptive Agents, Male", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Drugs", "Economic Factors", "Enzymes And Enzyme Inhibitors", "Family Planning", "Genitalia", "Germ Cells", "Gossypol", "Health", "Health Services", "In Vitro", "India", "Medicine", "Physiology", "Plants, Medicinal", "Research And Development", "Research Methodology", "Southern Asia", "Sperm Immobilizing Agents", "Spermatozoa", "Spermicidal Contraceptive Agents", "Technology", "Treatment", "Urogenital System"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "3019180", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1986", "Month": "10", "Day": "20"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "09", "Day": "12"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0303-4569", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "18", "Issue": "4", "PubDate": {"Year": "1986", "Season": "Jul-Aug"}}, "Title": "Andrologia", "ISOAbbreviation": "Andrologia"}, "ArticleTitle": "Studies on the male antifertility agent gossypol acetic acid.
