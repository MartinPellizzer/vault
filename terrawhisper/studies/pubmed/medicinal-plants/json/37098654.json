Since ACCPA production can be initiated a long time before RA sign appearance, primary auto-immunization against these citrullinated proteins can be originated from extra-articular sites. It has been shown that there is a significant association between P. gingivalis periodontitis, anti- P. gingivalis antibodies, and RA. P. gingivalis gingipains (Rgp, Kgp) can degrade proteins such as fibrin and \u03b1-enolase into some peptides in the form of Arg in the C-terminal which is converted to citrulline by PPAD. Also, PPAD can citrullinate type II collagen and vimentins (SA antigen). P. gingivalis induces inflammation and chemoattraction of immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages through the increase of C5a (gingipain C5 convertase-like activity) and SCFA secretion. Besides, this microorganism stimulates anoikis, a special type of apoptosis, and NETosis, an antimicrobial form of neutrophil death, leading to the release of PAD1-4, \u03b1-enolase, and vimentin from apoptotic cells into the periodontal site. In addition, gingipains can degrade macrophages CD14 and decrease their ability in apoptotic cell removal. Gingipains also can cleave IgGs in the Fc region and transform them into rheumatoid factor (RF) antigens. In the present study, the effects of P. gingivalis on rheumatoid arthritis autoimmune response have been reviewed, which could attract practical insight both in bench and clinic."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
