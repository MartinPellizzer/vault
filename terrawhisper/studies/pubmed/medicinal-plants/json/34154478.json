The benzamide derivatives <b>16a-e</b> showed higher cytotoxicity than their corresponding Schiff bases <b>15a-e</b>. Compounds <b>16a</b>,<b>b</b>,<b>d</b> also inhibited the growth of MCF-7/ADR cells with IC<sub>50</sub> in the range of 0.52-6.26\u2009\u03bcM. Interestingly, the new compounds were less cytotoxic against normal MRC-5 cells (IC<sub>50</sub>=0.155-17.08\u2009\u03bcM). Mechanistic studies revealed the ability of compounds <b>16a</b>,<b>b</b>,<b>d</b> to inhibit tubulin polymerisation and multiple oncogenic kinases. Moreover, compounds <b>16a</b>,<b>b</b>,<b>d</b> induced preG<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub>/M cell cycle arrest and early apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. The molecular docking analyses of compounds <b>16a</b>,<b>b</b>,<b>d</b> into the active site in tubulin, CDK-2, and EGFR proteins revealed higher binding affinities compared to the co-crystallised ligands. These preliminary results suggested that compounds <b>16a</b>,<b>b</b>,<b>d</b> could serve as promising lead compounds for the future development of new potent anticancer agents.HighlightsTwo new series of pyrrolizines bearing 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl moieties were synthesized.Compounds <b>16a</b>,<b>b</b>,<b>d</b> displayed the highest cytotoxicity against the three cancer cell lines.Kinase profiling test revealed inhibition of multiple oncogenic kinases by compounds <b>16a</b>,<b>b</b>,<b>d</b>.Compounds <b>16a</b>,<b>b</b>,<b>d</b> exhibited weak to moderate inhibition of tubulin-polymerization.Compounds <b>16a</b>,<b>b</b>,<b>d</b> induced preG<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub>/M cell cycle arrest and early apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.Docking studies revealed high binding affinities for compounds <b>16a</b>,<b>b</b> towards tubulin and CDK-2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Science and Technology Unit (STU), Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Laboratory for Micro-analysis, Minia University, Minia, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Shawky", "ForeName": "Ahmed M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Beni-Suef University, Beni-Suef, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ibrahim", "ForeName": "Nashwa A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research Institute, National Center for Research, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Abdalla", "ForeName": "Ashraf N", "Initials": "AN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Minia University, Minia, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abourehab", "ForeName": "Mohammed A S", "Initials": "MAS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4527-8885"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Beni-Suef University, Beni-Suef, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Gouda", "ForeName": "Ahmed M", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101150203", "ISSNLinking": "1475-6366"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tubulin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "MCF-7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrazoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tubulin"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declared that there is no conflict of interest and have approved the article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Siegel RL, Miller KD, Jemal A..
