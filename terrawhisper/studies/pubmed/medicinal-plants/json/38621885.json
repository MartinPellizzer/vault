In this study, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry(UPLC-MS/MS) method was established for simultaneously determining five components in Shuganning Injection and Scutellariae Radix extract in bile, urine, and feces of rats, so as to reveal the difference in the excretion process of Shuganning Injection and Scutellariae Radix extract in rats and explore the law of the excretion process of the five components in vivo before and after the compatibility of Scutellariae Radix. Rats were injected with Shuganning Injection and Scutellariae Radix extract(4.2 mL\u00b7kg~(-1)), respectively, and the excretion of baicalin, baicalein, oroxylin A, oroxylin A-7-O-\u03b2-D-glucuronide, and scutellarin in bile, urine, and feces of rats in 24 h was observed. The results showed that except for baicalin, the other four index components were excreted as prototype components in a high proportion after intravenous injection of Shuganning Injection and Scutellariae Radix extract in rats, respectively. The excretion of each component was relatively high in urine and less in feces and bile. After the compatibility of Scutellariae Radix extract, the accumulative excretion of five index components in rats all decreased. Among them, the cumulative excretion of baicalein in bile, urine, and feces significantly decreased by 26.67%, 48.11%, and 31.01%. The cumulative excretion of baicalin in bile, urine, and feces decreased significantly by 70.69%, 19.43%, and 31.22%. The result showed that the five index components in Scutellariae Radix extract were mainly excreted by the kidneys, and other components in Shuganning Injection delayed the excretion process and prolonged the residence time. This study is of great significance for elucidating the compatibility rationality of Shuganning Injection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Zi-Peng", "Initials": "ZP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yue-Ting", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), National Engineering Research Center of Miao's Medicines, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Scutellaria baicalensis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38621885", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20231106.201"]}}]}
