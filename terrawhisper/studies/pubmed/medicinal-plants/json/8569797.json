The results showed significant changes in micronucleus frequency which were caused by each different concentration of WSCS. This indicates that the Vicia faba root tip micronucleus test might be used as one kind of mutagenic detection method for cigarette smoke. A comparative evaluation on the mutagenicity of 10 brands of cigarettes was carried out. Results confirmed that various degrees of mutagenicity were found for all of the brand cigarettes, among them, Huaihai was the highest, while Camellia was the lowest. The micronucleus frequencies were reduced by adding tea polyphenol, nicotinamide adenine, vitamin C and sodium selenite to the WSCS. The results suggest that these added substances might reduce the genetic injury induced by cigarette smoke."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Nanjing Normal University, China."}], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Q", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Micronucleus Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8569797", "10.1016/s0165-1161(96)90003-5", "S0165-1161(96)90003-5"]}}]}
