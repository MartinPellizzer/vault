(Ginkgoacae). Their maximum level in phytopharmaceuticals containing ginkgo extracts has been recently restricted to 5 microg/g by the Commission E of the former Federal German Health Authority. In order to detect ginkgolic acids at these low levels, a sensitive and selective analytical method, based on liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ES-MS) has been developed. The three main phenolic acids (1-3) of the chloroform fruit extract were isolated and used as standards for quantification. In the LC-ES-MS negative ion mode, calibration curves with good linearities (r=0.9973, n=6) were obtained in the range of 0.5-10 microg/g for compounds 1, 2 and between 0.1 and 7.5 microg/g (r=0.9949, n=6) for ginkgolic acid 3. The detection limits at a SIN ratio of 3 were 0.1 (3) and 0.25 microg/g (1, 2). Recoveries were around 101% at 5 microg/g for the substances detected in the leaf extracts. Good precision was achieved with relative standard deviations of less than 4% (n=6). The optimised method was applied to verify whether the amount of gingkolic acids was below 5 microg/g in a standardised leaf extract which is a constituent of a phytopreparation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut de Pharmacognosie et Phytochimie, BEP, Universit\u00e9 de Lausanne, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ndjoko", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolfender", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hostettmann", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr B Biomed Sci Appl", "NlmUniqueID": "9714109", "ISSNLinking": "1387-2273"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Salicylates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "22910-60-7", "NameOfSubstance": "ginkgolic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Salicylates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10993512", "10.1016/s0378-4347(00)00316-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
