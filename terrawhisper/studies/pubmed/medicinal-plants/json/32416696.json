This characteristic seems relevant and should be the subject of thorough discussion with respect to saponin.", "The current data mainly focus on the impact of saponin in the treatment of type-II diabetes. The majority of studies emphasize on other secondary metabolites such as alkaloids and flavonoids, but very few papers are there representing the possible role of saponin as these papers express the narrow perspective of saponin phytoconstituents but lacking in providing the complete information on various saponin plants. The aim of the study was to summarize all available data concerning the saponin containing plant in the management of type-II diabetes.", "All relevant papers on saponin were selected. This review summarizes the saponin isolation method, mechanism of action, clinical significance, medicinal plants and phytoconstituents responsible for producing a therapeutic effect in the management of diabetes.", "The saponin is of high potential with structural diversity and inhibits diabetic complications along with reducing the hyperglycemia through different mechanisms thereby providing scope for improving the existing therapy and developing the novel medicinal agents for curing diabetes.", "Saponins having potential therapeutic benefits and are theorized as an alternative medication in decreasing serum blood glucose levels in the patient suffering from diabetes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Choudhary", "ForeName": "Neeraj", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Khatik", "ForeName": "Gopal Lal", "Initials": "GL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Suttee", "ForeName": "Ashish", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Diabetes Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "101253260", "ISSNLinking": "1573-3998"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Complications"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hyperglycemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32416696", "10.2174/1573399816666200516173829", "CDR-EPUB-106689"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
