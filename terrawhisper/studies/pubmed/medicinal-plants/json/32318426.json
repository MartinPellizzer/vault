Ayurvedic medications and methods are commonly practised in India for curing several ailments. Lepidium sativum (garden cress) is an important herb that belongs to Brassicaceae family. It is believed that the plant has its origin in Ethiopia but is now cultivated throughout the world. The plant is well-known in Ayurveda for its beneficial properties it holds. The present study describes the fracture healing property of the methanolic and aqueous extract of Lepidium sativum seeds. For the study, 21 Charles foster rats were used. They were grouped into three groups each containing seven rats: control, methanolic, and aqueous group. Rats were anesthetized using ether vapors and fractures were induced in each rat from all the three groups using hand held three-point bending technique. The broken bone fragments were then stabilized using splints. The control group was administered with normal saline, along with food and water, post-fracture. The methanolic group was administered with the methanolic extract of Lepidium sativum seeds at dose of 400 mg/kg given orally, post-fracture along with food and water. The third group received aqueous extract of the seeds in doses of 550 mg/kg orally, along with daily food and water intake for a period of 8 weeks. The results were evaluated both radiologically and biochemically. X-rays were done on day 0, 2<sup>nd</sup> week, and 4<sup>th</sup> week post-fractures to look for the callus formation and serum levels for calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatases were evaluated on 0 day, 1 week, 2<sup>nd</sup> week, 4<sup>th</sup> week, 6<sup>th</sup> week, 8<sup>th</sup> week, and 10<sup>th</sup> week post-injury. It was observed at the end of the study period that the methanolic group had significant callus formation starting at the 2<sup>nd</sup> week itself post-fracture. The serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatases at 4<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, and 8<sup>th</sup> weeks had significant <i>P</i> values in the methanolic group rats."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Dixit Jr Iii", "ForeName": "Vinti", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Ishan", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Palandurkar", "ForeName": "Kamlesh", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Government Medical College, Akola, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Giri", "ForeName": "Reena", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Giri", "ForeName": "Kiran", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Family Med Prim Care", "NlmUniqueID": "101610082", "ISSNLinking": "2249-4863"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Singh V.
