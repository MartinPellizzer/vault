The animal model of emphysema was induced by intratracheal instillation of porcine pancreatic elastase. Dansen injection and alpha1-ATwere instilled intratracheal in two treated group after 14 days with porcine pancreatic elastase, respectively, once a week, to continue for four weeks. The level of alpha1-AT in serum and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analyzed in different times. The mean linear intercept value (MLIV) and the numbers of alveolar per square (NAPS) of all groups were compared after eight weeks with porcine pancreatic elastase.", "The levels of alpha1-AT in BALF were significantly different between treated groups and emphysema group after two weeks treatment, alpha1-AT levels of treated groups were more increased than those of emphysema group (P < 0.01). The levels of alpha1-AT in serum were similar at same times in different groups (P > 0.05), but were great different in different times. The MLIV and the NAPS were significantly different from emphysema group to treated groups in sixth and eighth weeks (P < 0.01), there is no difference between dancen group and alpha1-AT group.", "The contents of alpha1-AT in local pulmonary tissue could be improved by Dansen injection through intratracheal instillation during the information of emphysema in rabbits.
