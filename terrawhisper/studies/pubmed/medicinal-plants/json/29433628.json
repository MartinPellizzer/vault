Due to self-incompatibility in stevia, somatic embryo investigation for artificial seed production is valuable in this plant. In order to evaluate the callus induction characteristics in stevia, a factorial experiment was laid out based on a completely randomized design with three replications. The factors included ten hormone combinations and control, two kinds of media (MS and B5) and two types of explants (leaf and internode). Callus induction characters including the percentage of callus formation, days to callus induction, fresh and dry callus weight were recorded. Analysis of variance showed significant differences (p&lt;0.01) among hormone combinations, media and explant types as well as their interactions. The best treatment for callus induction with minimum time to callus formation was 1 mg/l NAA+1 mg/l BAP. The highest fresh and dry callus weight were obtained on B5 medium supplemented by 1 mg/l 2,4-D+1 mg/l BAP (in leaf explant) and 0.25 mg/l 2,4-D+ 0.1 mg/l BAP (in internode explant). These results can be used in suspension culture. To induce somatic embryogenesis in suspension culture, six hormone treatments were investigated. The highest somatic embryogenesis percentage was obtained in MS medium supplemented by 2 mg/l 2,4-D+ 0.5 mg/l NAA+0.5 mg/l BAP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy and Plant Breeding, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Keshvari", "ForeName": "Tahereh", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy and Plant Breeding, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Najaphy", "ForeName": "Abdollah", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy and Plant Breeding, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kahrizi", "ForeName": "Danial", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy and Plant Breeding, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zebarjadi", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "embryology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Somatic Embryogenesis Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "embryology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "embryology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "embryology"], "DescriptorName": "Stevia"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29433628", "10.14715/cmb/2018.64.2.9"]}}]}
