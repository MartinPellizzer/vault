The present study evaluated the effects of TJ-135 on concanavalin A (con A)-induced hepatitis in mice in vivo and con A-induced cytokine production in vitro. When mice were pretreated with oral TJ-135 for 1 week before intravenous con A injection, the activities of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly decreased 8 h after con A administration (-82%, -96% and -66% respectively). In histological investigations, sub-massive hepatic necrosis accompanying inflammatory cell infiltration was not observed in mice pretreated with TJ-135. Serum levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL-2 were significantly lower in mice pretreated with TJ-135 compared with controls, while IL-10 levels were higher in these mice. Intrasplenic IL-12 levels were significantly lower in mice pretreated with TJ-135, while intrasplenic IL-10 levels were higher in these mice. In vitro, IL-10 production by splenocytes was increased by the addition of TJ-135 to the culture medium, whereas the production of IL-12 and IFN-gamma was inhibited. These results suggest that con A-induced hepatitis was ameliorated by pretreatment with TJ-135. With regard to the mechanism of these effects of TJ-135, we speculate that TJ-135 inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokine and enhances the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore administration of TJ-135 may be useful in patients with severe acute hepatitis accompanying cholestasis or in those with autoimmune hepatitis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan. yamashik@clin.medic.mie-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamashiki", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mase", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arai", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "X X", "Initials": "XX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nobori", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishimura", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sakaguchi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inoue", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Clin Sci (Lond)", "NlmUniqueID": "7905731", "ISSNLinking": "0143-5221"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11028-71-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Concanavalin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "130068-27-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-10"}, {"RegistryNumber": "187348-17-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-12"}, {"RegistryNumber": "82115-62-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Interferon-gamma"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Alanine Transaminase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Concanavalin A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Interferon-gamma"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-10"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-12"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11052923"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
