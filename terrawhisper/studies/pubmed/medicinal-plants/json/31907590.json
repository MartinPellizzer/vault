This strategy has perfect applicability in a complex herbal medicine matrix. The strategy combines a semiquantitative immunochromatographic strip assay with a heterologous indirect competitive ELISA. When there was no matrix interference, the ELISA had a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 2.6 ng\u00b7mL<sup>-1</sup> and a limit of detection of 0.2 ng\u00b7mL<sup>-1</sup>. The immunochromatographic strip assay can be completed within 5 min with a visual limit of detection of 1 ng\u00b7mL<sup>-1</sup>. Although the sample matrix had different effects on the sensitivity of the antibody, excellent repeatability and accuracy were achieved. The method was successfully applied for the screening and determination of prometryn residue in multiple complex herb samples for the first time, and the results were in good agreement with those obtained by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The proposed strategy is rapid, of high-throughput, and of low cost, and may be a promising choice for on-site detection of prometryn in different kinds of herbs.
