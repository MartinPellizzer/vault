TNBCs are commonly known for their complex heterogeneity and poor prognosis. The present work aimed to develop a predictive 2D and 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models against metastatic TNBC cell line. The 2D-QSAR was based on multiple linear regression analysis and validated by Leave-One-Out (LOO) and external test set prediction approach. QSAR model presented regression coefficient values for training set (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>), LOO-based internal regression (<i>q</i><sup>2</sup>) and external test set regression (pred_<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>) which are 0.84, 0.82 and 0.75, respectively. Five properties, Epsilon4 (electronegativity), ChiV3cluster (valence molecular connectivity index), chi3chain (retention index for three-membered ring), TNN5 (nitrogen atoms separated through 5 bond distance) and nitrogen counts, were identified as important structural features responsible for anticancer activity of MDA-MB-231 inhibitors. Five novel derivatives of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) named GA-1, GA-2, GA-3, GA-4 and GA-5 were semi-synthesised and screened through the QSAR model. Further, <i>in vitro</i> activities of the derivatives were analysed against human TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231. The result showed that GA-1 exhibits improved cytotoxic activity to that of parent compound (GA). Further, atomic property field (APF)-based 3D-QSAR and scoring recognise C-30 carboxylic group of GA-1 as major influential factor for its anticancer activity. The significance of C-30 carboxylic group in GA derivatives was also confirmed by molecular docking study against cancer target glyoxalase-I. Finally, the oral bioavailability and toxicity of GA-1 were assessed by computational ADMET studies.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
