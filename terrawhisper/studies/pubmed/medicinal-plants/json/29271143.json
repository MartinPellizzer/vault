In addition to liver and kidney injuries as the major side effects of Xanthii Fructus, neurotoxicity and cardio-toxicity of Xanthii Fructus were also common clinical adverse events. However, there have been a few animal experimental studies so far. Oral administration and external application with Xanthii Fructus have often caused skin reactions, even such severe cases as exfoliative dermatitis. The authors suggested standardizing the clinical medication, avoiding to use untreated prescriptions and unprocessed herbs, ensuring the effective and safety use of Xanthii Fructus in strict accordance with the recommended dosage and usage in pharmacopeia, paying attention to the accumulation of safety signals, strengthening studies on toxic substance, toxicity mechanism, and synergy and attenuation effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dongfang Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100078, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jing-Xia", "Initials": "JX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dongfang Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100078, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dongfang Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100078, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Ju-Kai", "Initials": "JK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dongfang Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100078, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hui", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Gui-Bo", "Initials": "GB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Xue-Min", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthium"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29271143", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170919.009"]}}]}
