The data collection involved administration of interviewer-structured questionnaires to the mothers. The questionnaire was designed to collect information on the medicinal and consumption pattern of vegetables. The chemical compositions of the vegetables were analyzed using standard methods. The nutrient composition of the vegetables showed that the protein content of Jathropha tanjorenses (40.94%) was significantly higher than the remaining leafy vegetable samples, whereas Curcubita pepo (8.25%) contained the least protein content. The fiber content of Solanum americanum (13.79%) was significantly higher when compared with other leafy vegetable samples. Also, the energy value of Baselia allia (401.68 kcal) was the highest, whereas that of C. pepo (285.10 kcal) was the lowest. Regarding mineral composition, J. tanjorenses had the highest contents of zinc, iron, and Na/K ratio, whereas Vernononia amygdalina and Solanum macrocarpon had the least and highest Na/K and Ca/P ratios, respectively. The consumption patterns of the respondents showed that one-quarter of the respondents consumed the vegetables regularly, whereas the remaining consumed occasionally or never consumed the vegetables. In conclusion, this study established that the leafy vegetables contained appreciable amounts of nutrients that could be of health and nutritional benefits to the consumers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology (Human Nutrition Division), Federal University of Technology, Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria. soijarotimi2000@yahoo.co.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ijarotimi", "ForeName": "O Steve", "Initials": "OS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ekeh", "ForeName": "Ogechi", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ajayi", "ForeName": "O Philip", "Initials": "OP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet Surveys"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Intake"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interviews as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mothers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20412021", "10.1089/jmf.2009.0023"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
