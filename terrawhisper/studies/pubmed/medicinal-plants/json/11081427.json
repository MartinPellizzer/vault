The effects of lupin non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs) on apparent metabolisable energy (AME) and composition of digesta from broiler chickens were examined in a dose-response experiment in conjunction with a single combination of 2 commercial enzyme products known from previous studies to partially depolymerise NSPs in diets containing sorghum, casein and lupin kernel. The 7-d experiment was conducted on broiler chickens (24 to 31 d of age) in metabolism cages. 2. The basal diet used in this study contained (in g/kg) sorghum (low tannin) 800, casein 134, celite 20 and vitamins and minerals 46. The inclusion rate for each enzyme product was 0.2 g/kg. Lupin kernel isolate (containing 560 g/kg total NSPs) replaced some of the sorghum and casein. The dose rates of lupin kernel isolate (50, 100 and 150 g/kg) were equivalent to dietary inclusion rates of 80, 160 and 240 g/kg, approximately, of untreated lupin kernel from Lupinus angustifolius cultivar Gungurru. 3. Inclusion of lupin kernel isolate in the diet depressed AME and bird performance, and raised ileal viscosity and excreta moisture, in a dose-dependent manner. 4. A combination of 2 proprietary enzyme products improved dietary AME by 0.3 MJ/kg dry matter. Enzymes reduced excreta moisture when inclusion of lupin kernel isolate was 50 g/kg (equivalent to lupin kernel at 80 g/kg, approximately) but not at higher inclusions. 5. Food enzymes partially depolymerised some insoluble NSPs in lupin kernel isolate, which increased ileal viscosity and soluble NSP content of digesta. 6. It was concluded that development of appropriate exogenous enzyme products could lead to lupin NSPs being used as an energy source for poultry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pig and Poultry Production Institute, University of Adelaide, Roseworthy SA, Australia. hughes.bob@saugov.sa.gov.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hughes", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choct", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kocher", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van Barneveld", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br Poult Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "15740290R", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Contents"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Ileum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viscosity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11081427", "10.1080/713654936"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
