The rats in control group were only receive distilled water every day. The rats in ISO group also received two subcutaneous injections (85 mg x kg(-1)) of ISO, which were separated by a 24 hour interval and began to receive distilled water 2 weeks later every day. The rats in Wenxin Keli and control group were receive Wenxin Keli (9 mg x kg(-1)) every day. The rats in Wenxin Keli and ISO group received two subcutaneous injections (85 mg x kg(-1)) of ISO, which were separated by a 24 hour interval and began to receive Wenxin Keli (9 mg x kg(-1)) 2 weeks later every day. The rats in valsartan and control group were receive valsartan every day. The rats in valsartan and ISO group received two subcutaneous injections (85 mg x kg(-1)) of ISO, which were separated by a 24 hour interval and began to receive valsartan 30 mg x kg(-1) 2 weeks later every day. Echocardiogram measurement in rats were carried out after 4 weeks and 10 weeks feeding medince of hemodynamic measurement and aconitine induced arrhythmia in rats were carried out after 10 weeks.", "Echocardiogram indicated that left ventricular internal diameter at diastolic phase (LVIDd), left ventricular internal diameter at systolic phase (LVIDs), LV percent fractional shortening (FS) and LV ejection fraction (EF) were decreased in the ISO group. Treatment with valsartan 4 weeks later, FS and EF were increased compared with the ISO group and 10 weeks later, LVIDd, LVIDs, FS, EF were increased. However, treatment with Wenxin Keli 10 weeks later, LVIDs, FS, EF were not changed obviously. Hemodynamic measurement showed that left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), and dp/dt(max) were improved after 10 weeks of treatment with valsartan. The LVEDP was decreased and dp/dt(max), was increased after 10 weeks of treatment with Wenxin Keli. Aconitine induced arrhythmia in rats in Wenxin Keli and control group were less serious than those in control group, aconitine induced arrhythmia in rats in Wenxin Keli and ISO group were less serious than those in ISO group.", "Wenxin Keli could greatly improve the ISO induced cardiac dysfunction and protect the aconitine-induced arrhythmia in rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Fen", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Shen-jiang", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mu", "ForeName": "Yun", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiotonic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "wenxin keli"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L628TT009W", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoproterenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Arrhythmias, Cardiac"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiotonic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Echocardiography"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Heart"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Failure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemodynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isoproterenol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ventricular Function, Left"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18027666"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
