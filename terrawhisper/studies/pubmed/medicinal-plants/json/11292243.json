Saiboku-to inhibited Compound 48/80-induced degranulation of and histamine release from the mast cells, suggesting that Saiboku-to not only possesses anti-histamine release effect from mast cells, but also contains active herbs with this effect. Significant inhibitions were found in 4 of 10 constituent herbs of Saiboku-to: Magnoliae Cortex, Perillae Herba, Bupleuri Radix and Hoelen. In the dose-response curves of the four herbs, the logarithmic linearity was observed for each herb, and 50% inhibitory concentration, the IC50 values, were calculated to be 56.8 microg/ml for Magnoliae Cortex, 175.8 microl/ml for Perillae Herba, 356.6 microg/ml for Bupleuri Radix, and 595.8 microg/ml for Hoelen. One mg/ml of Saiboku-to showing 75% inhibition of Compound 48/80-induced histamine release level from mast cells contains 88.5 microg of Magnoliae Cortex (it was estimated from the dose-response curve that this dose inhibits 62.68% of the Compound 48/80-induced histamine release level), 58.8 microg of Perillae Herba (21% inhibition), 205.9 microg of Bupleuri Radix (35.24% inhibition), and 147.1 microg of Hoelen (11.15% inhibition). From these results, it is suggested that the anti-histamine release effect of Saiboku-to, which contains 10 herbs, may be due mainly to the effect of Magnoliae Cortex and the synergism of the 3 other herbs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychopharmacology (Tsumura), Gunma University School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan. ikarishi@med.gumna-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ikarashi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuzurihara", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sakakibara", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ishimaru", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maruyama", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Phytomedicine", "NlmUniqueID": "9438794", "ISSNLinking": "0944-7113"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Histamine H1 Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "saiboku-to"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4091-50-3", "NameOfSubstance": "p-Methoxy-N-methylphenethylamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine H1 Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine Release"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mast Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Kampo"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peritoneum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "p-Methoxy-N-methylphenethylamine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11292243", "10.1078/0944-7113-00012", "S0944-7113(04)70002-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
