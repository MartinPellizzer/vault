Endophytes are beneficial to their host cells as such its application is observed in every aspects of life. This study therefore endeavored to give an analysis of endophytes, what they were and what they had been used for till the present time. Sampling of several literature studies in endophytes was done in this study to enable a complete understanding of the mechanism of application of the actions of endophytes, so as to be able to do a thorough assessment of the current state in the knowledge of the microbes. From the complete analysis of the literature on the application and use of endophytes, in nutrient asquition and increase the stress tolerance in plants. This study provided a platform for further research gaps through the presentation of what endophytes were, what they had been used for till date, the mechanism of operation of the micro-organism and the type of interaction between them and their hosts. There are still ways to improve on the methods of application of endophytes as a type of biological organism. This will be done by adjusting to the current trends in biological studies using molecular mechanization, following an intensive further study on endophyte mechanisms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Anyasi", "ForeName": "Raymond Oriebe", "Initials": "RO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Atagana", "ForeName": "Harrison Ifeanyichukwu", "Initials": "HI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101247723", "ISSNLinking": "1028-8880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecology"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microalgae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutrients"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Symbiosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31930816", "10.3923/pjbs.2019.154.167"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
