The anti-biofilm formation of various components of essential oils extracted from selected medicinal plants were investigated and tested on EPEC and wild strains of <i>E. coli</i>. Oils extracted from the family Asteraceae and their major common constituents at 0.031 and 0.062% (V/v) were found to significantly inhibit biofilm formation without affecting the growth of planktonic cells. In addition, three plants belonging to this family (<i>Artemisia herba alba</i>, <i>Artemisia campestris</i> and <i>Artemisia absinthium</i>) played important roles in the antimicrobial activity. Interestingly, their essential oils reduced the ability of <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> (the EPEC and K12 strains) to form a biofilm. The crystal violet reduction assay showed that the plant extracts tested reduced biofilm formation with the inhibition of bacterial attachment up to 45% for EPEC and 70% for <i>E. coli</i> K-12 after 24\u2009h treatment at 0.62\u2009mg ml<sup>-1</sup>, demonstrating that <i>Artemisia</i> oils had a high anti-biofilm activity on the bacteria tested. The results indicate that the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) acquired by horizontal transfer promotes the formation of the attaching and effacing (A/E) lesion and increases the capacity of the photogen strain (EPEC) to form a biofilm. The chemical composition of the volatile compounds was obtained by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, which showed that the essential oils consisted of thirty-four compounds. Chamazulene (39.21%), \u03b2-pinene (32.07%), and \u03b1-thujone (29.39%) were the main constituents of the essential oils of <i>A. herba alba</i>, <i>A. absinthium</i> and <i>A. campestris,</i> respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4629-2438"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Biomonitoring Laboratory (LR01/ES14), Sciences Faculty of Bizerte, University of Carthage, Zarzouna, Tunisia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medico-Surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, Sapienza University of Rome, Laboratory affiliated to Istituto Pasteur Italia-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Latina, Italy."}], "LastName": "Mathlouthi", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Biomonitoring Laboratory (LR01/ES14), Sciences Faculty of Bizerte, University of Carthage, Zarzouna, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Saadaoui", "ForeName": "Nabil", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medico-Surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, Sapienza University of Rome, Laboratory affiliated to Istituto Pasteur Italia-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Latina, Italy."}], "LastName": "Pennacchietti", "ForeName": "Eugenia", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medico-Surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, Sapienza University of Rome, Laboratory affiliated to Istituto Pasteur Italia-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Latina, Italy."}], "LastName": "De Biase", "ForeName": "Daniela", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Biomonitoring Laboratory (LR01/ES14), Sciences Faculty of Bizerte, University of Carthage, Zarzouna, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Ben-Attia", "ForeName": "Mossadok", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biofouling", "NlmUniqueID": "9200331", "ISSNLinking": "0892-7014"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Biofouling. 2021 Mar;37(3):I. doi: 10.1080/08927014.2021.1917128", "PMID": "33906541"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virulence"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "41"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33588649", "10.1080/08927014.2021.1886278"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
