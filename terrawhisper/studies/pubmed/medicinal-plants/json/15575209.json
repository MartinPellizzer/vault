Among them, the volumes of xPr 16, 19 were significantly decreased, and the volumes of xPr 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 18, 23 were significantly increased. When treated with FR, the volumes of xPr 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 18, 23 were significantly decreased, and the volumes of xPr 8, 9, 11, 12, 23, 14 were back to normal level. Two factors statistic analysis showed that FR had interaction with LPS for xPr 1, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and FR might be the functional antagonist of LPS. We also observed that the volumes of xPr 10, 13, 15, 20, 21, 22 were found to change significantly only in FR treated group but not in LPS treated group or control group. Interestingly, the volume of xPr 13, 20, 21, 22 were increased and the volume of xPr 10, 15 were decreased.", "The molecular basis of therapeutic effect of FR on endotoxemia might be through the regulation of xPr 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 18, 23. We can use proteomic techniques to study the molecular mechanisms of diseases treated by functional Chinese herbs and the combination of different herbs is necessary for the treatment of endotoxemia, as FR can not regulated all the changed proteins induced by LPS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Affiliated Hospital, North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong 637000, China. xiewenguang@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Wen-guang", "Initials": "WG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Ning-sheng", "Initials": "NS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xiao-chang", "Initials": "XC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Qin-xue", "Initials": "QX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Nong-le", "Initials": "NL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Yu-shu", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hui-xin", "Initials": "HX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ke-ji", "Initials": "KJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteome"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Endotoxemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Proteome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Scrophularia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15575209"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
