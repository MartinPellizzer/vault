CT-free Centrosema pubescens was also fed for comparison with the CT legumes, and each legume was included (300 g/kg DM) in a basal diet of pangola grass (Digitaria decumbens). Pangola grass alone was used as a control diet. There were no significant (P > 0.05) differences between sheep and goats for the efficiency of digestion of N (0.574, SE 0.013), organic matter (OM; 0.519, SE 0.010), neutral-detergent fibre (NDF; 0.524, SE 0.011) and acid-detergent fibre (ADF; 0.407, SE 0.016). Diets containing desmodium and calliandra were digested less well in the rumen (64 and 62% of total OM digested) when compared with the pangola and centrosema diets (74 and 73% of total OM digested in rumen). There was an apparent net gain of 30% in ADF across the digestive tract of sheep and goats given calliandra, and this gain was ascribed to the formation of 'artifact' fibre as a result of fibre-tannin interaction. Overall, inclusion of legume at 300 g/kg in the diet significantly increased (P < 0.05) the concentration of acetic acid and decreased butyric acid concentration in the rumen fluid of sheep and goats. Significantly higher proportions of dietary N apparently reached the abomasum of animals given the diets containing desmodium (50%) and calliandra (56%) when compared with animals given the centrosema and pangola diets (35%). Sheep and goats given the CT diets also had higher excretions of faecal N. This increment of faecal N (14%) did not affect post-rumen N digestion (P > 0.05) since animals given CT diets absorbed more N (19%) per kg total OM digested than those given the control diets. It was concluded that whilst the low levels of CT provided in desmodium (1.0%) and calliandra (2.3%) diets protected dietary protein from degradation in the rumen, there were no overall beneficial or detrimental effects of CT in these diets for sheep or goats. A method was developed to categorize CT into fractions representative of their forms (free, protein-bound, and fibre-bound) during the digestion process. A quantitative model of CT metabolism during passage through the digestive tract was developed from the measured exchanges of CT between free, protein-bound and fibre-bound pools in the rumen and lower digestive tract. CT interchange mainly occurred in the reticulo-rumen of both animal species. Desmodium and calliandra free CT showed net losses of 68 and 78% in the rumen respectively and 57 and 68% of the fibre-bound CT was lost in the same site for sheep and goats respectively. However, protein-bound CT increased across the rumen by 73 and 56% for both animal species. Post-rumen losses of the total CT abomasal flow were 86 and 83% (free CT) for sheep and goats respectively, 70 and 66% (protein-bound CT), whilst 28% loss of fibre-bound CT occurred in sheep and goats respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agriculture, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia."}], "LastName": "Perez-Maldonado", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Norton", "ForeName": "B W", "Initials": "BW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0372547", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthocyanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proanthocyanidins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "18206-61-6", "NameOfSubstance": "proanthocyanidin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Anthocyanins"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Goats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Proanthocyanidins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rumen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8942360", "10.1079/bjn19960060", "S0007114596001638"]}}]}
