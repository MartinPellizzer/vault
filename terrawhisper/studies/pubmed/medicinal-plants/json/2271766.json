(Plant & Cell Physiol. 1970). The creep process of the cell wall was simulated by a numerical integration using stress-relaxation parameters, because the direct conversion of the stress relaxation process to the creep is impractical. In the conversion, a personal computer was programmed for the Maxwell viscoelastic model with a compiler language. Cell wall creep was measured with a specially constituted apparatus and compared with that calculated by the simulation process. The results suggested that the creep can be reproduced by a computer simulation using the stress-relaxation parameters. Both creep and stress-relaxation properties of plant cell walls can be analyzed by using a single model."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biology, Tezukayama College, Gakuen-minami, Nara, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yamamoto", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sakurai", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biorheology", "NlmUniqueID": "0372526", "ISSNLinking": "0006-355X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Wall"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Mechanical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2271766", "10.3233/bir-1990-27511"]}}]}
