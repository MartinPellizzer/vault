The carrageenan test was performed to assess anti-inflammatory potential, and anti-pyretic activity was evaluated by the brewer's yeast-induced pyrexia method.", "The results showed that the T. cordifolia extract exhibited significant analgesic effects in a dose-dependent manner in the three pain models tested. The extract also exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effects in the carrageenan-induced inflammation test and antipyretic effects in the brewer's yeast-induced pyrexia test in dose-dependent manner compared to the effects observed in the control group animals.", "From the findings of the present study, it can be concluded that T. cordifolia extract has strong analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic effects. Further studies are required to investigate the therapeutic activities of the phytochemical constituents of T. cordifolia against pain, inflammation and pyrexia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Liaqat", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akash", "ForeName": "Muhammad S H", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ain", "ForeName": "Noor-Ul", "Initials": "NU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacy, Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rehman", "ForeName": "Kanwal", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Chemistry and Biochemistry, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ibrahim", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Adv Clin Exp Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101138582", "ISSNLinking": "1899-5276"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antipyretics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9000-07-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Carrageenan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antipyretics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carrageenan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Fever"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tinospora"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26771966", "10.17219/acem/27909"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
