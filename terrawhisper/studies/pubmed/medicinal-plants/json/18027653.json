The correlation existed in the common peaks of HPLC fingerprint of Kushen Tang and the Chinese meteria medicines which composed the prescription was explored by analyzing the HPLC fingerprints of different compatibilities. The chemical constituents which the common peaks stood for were analyzed by adding controls to the samples respectively.", "Under the detective wavelength 280 nm, 19 common peaks were found, which came from S. baicalensis except that two peaks came from S. flavescens, and eight peaks were baicalin/trifolirhizin, wogonoside, luteolin, baicalein, oroxylin A, 5, 8-dihydroxy-6, 7-dimethoxyflavone, wogonin and formononetin/chrysin respectively. Under the detective wavelength 365 nm, 22 common peaks were found, which thirteen peaks came from S. baicalensis and six peaks came from S. flavescens. Among them, eleven peaks were baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, oroxylin A, 5,8-dihydroxy-6, 7-dimethoxyflavone, wogonin, chrysin/7-methoxyflavone, 2', 4-dihydroxy-4', 6'-dimethoxychalcone, 4, 4'-dimethoxychalcone, xanthohumol and kuraridin respectively.", "The common peaks of HPLC fingerprint of the flavonoids of Kushen Tang, which were obtained under the two detective wavelengths 280 nm and 365 nm, came from S. baicalensis and S. flavescens.
