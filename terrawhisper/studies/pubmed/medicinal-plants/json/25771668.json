However, their detailed pharmacological effects have not yet been clarified. Some reports have previously described symptoms of poisoning, but only a few reports have so far described shock and myocardial damage (MD). We experienced a case of shock and MD in a patient who had smoked law-evading herbs. A 61-year-old male presented at an emergency department 8 hours after smoking law-evading herbs (Rush Trip, High Men Monster) with chest pain. A vasopressor agent was administered to treat shock and antiarrhythmic drugs were administered due to ventricular arrhythmia. The contents of the law-evading herbs were unknown, so an in-hospital follow-up was conducted to treat the patient's symptoms. The follow-up blood test showed an increased level of cardiac enzymes, which thereafter demonstrated a spontaneous remission. The systemic conditions tended to improve and the patient was discharged from the hospital on the 5th hospital day. The contents of the law-evading herbs in question were thereafter,analyzed, and synthetic cannabinoids (JWH-210, JWH-081 and JWH-122) as well as caffeine were detected. The cause for the poisoning symptoms were suspected to be the presence of synthetic cannabinoids and caffeine. Such law-evading herbs may contain synthetic cannabinoids and caffeine which both may induce shock and MD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nakamura", "ForeName": "Yoshihiko", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nakano", "ForeName": "Minoru", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nakamura", "ForeName": "Mitsunobu", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miyazaki", "ForeName": "Dai", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Okamori", "ForeName": "Satoshi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Akuzawa", "ForeName": "Hisashi", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yuasa", "ForeName": "Masahiro", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Chudoku Kenkyu", "NlmUniqueID": "9310053", "ISSNLinking": "0914-3777"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Arrhythmia Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cannabinoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Illicit Drugs"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vasoconstrictor Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3G6A5W338E", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Arrhythmia Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "diagnosis", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Arrhythmias, Cardiac"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeine"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Cannabinoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrocardiography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Illicit Drugs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "diagnosis", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Shock, Cardiogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Vasoconstrictor Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25771668"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
