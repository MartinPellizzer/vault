By reference to ancient medical books of previous dynasties, a system review was conducted for infancy, formation, maturity and transition of cooked traditional Chinese medicine powder, and a comprehensive analysis was made for the six factors of cooked traditional Chinese medicine powder's maturity in the Song Dynasty. Efforts were made to collect domestic and foreign research literatures of modern formula granules, understand the detailed development, and conduct an objective analysis of the current clinical application of modern formula granules. According to the comparative analysis for the application characteristics of cooked traditional Chinese medicine powder and modern formula granules, \u2460the popularity of cooked traditional Chinese medicine powder in the Song Dynasty has six factors: soaring numbers of medical students and medical practitioners, high medical expenses due to huge army, rapid population growth, frequent epidemics and increasing diseases, and insufficient finances of central and local governments. \u2461On the basis of clinical application characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine formula granules, traditional Chinese medicine formula granules contain extracted and concentrated effective components, which guarantee the curative effect, meet modern people's demands for \"quick, simple and convenience\" traditional Chinese medicine decoctions, show a relatively high cost performance; however, formula granules are restricted by their varieties and lack unified quality control standards, and single-extract formula granules have not synergy and attenuation effects of combined traditional Chinese medicine decoctions, which also restricts its clinical application and promotion. \u2462Both have advantages in the process of clinical application, and shall be used based on syndromes. In conclusion, traditional Chinese medicine formula granules do not have disadvantages of \"difficult, complicated, turbid and disorderly\" cooked traditional Chinese medicine powder, and solve such problems as \"inflexibility, expensiveness, restriction, disorder and inefficacy\", which is the important basis for promoting traditional Chinese medicine formula granules."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100102, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100102, China."}], "LastName": "Zhai", "ForeName": "Hua-Qiang", "Initials": "HQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100102, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Wei-Lan", "Initials": "WL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100102, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Ji-Ru", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Health School, Beijing 100053, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Shi-Yuan", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong-Yan", "Initials": "YY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Powders"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["history", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Compounding"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Powders"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28875656", "10.4268/cjcmm20160533"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
