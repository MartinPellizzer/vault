The natural gallotannin 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-\u03b2-D-glucose (PGG) has been shown to possess anti-tumor effects on colon cancer cells, but its anti-metastatic effect is yet to be investigated. In this study, the effects of PGG on cell proliferation, colony formation ability, motility, migration were investigated in colon cancer cells using BrdU, colony formation, scratch, and transwell assays, respectively. Western blot assay was used for assessing protein expression. The orthotopic colon tumor-bearing mouse model and human colon cancer metastatic mouse model were employed to evaluate the anti-metastatic effects of PGG. Results showed that PGG exhibited not only anti-proliferative and colony formation inhibitory effects, but also inhibition on cell adhesion, motility, and migration in both HCT116 and colon 26-M01 cells via modulating protein expression of cathepsin B, FAK, cofilin, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition related proteins. In addition, PGG (10 or 15\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) could significantly inhibit liver and lung metastasis in colon cancer metastatic mice models. Furthermore, PGG could regulate the populations of T cells, macrophages, and MDSCs, while the levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 were altered after PGG treatment in metastatic CRC mice. This is the first report of the anti-metastatic effects of PGG by regulating cathepsin B-mediated extracellular matrix dynamics and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process in CRC. Our findings suggested that PGG has great potential to be developed as an anti-metastatic agent for metastatic CRC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
