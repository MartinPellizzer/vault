The current study presented a multi-faceted comparative metabolomics approach dissecting commercially available coffee products in the Middle East region for quality assessment and functional food purposes using NMR and GC/MS platforms. NMR metabolites fingerprinting led to identification of 18 metabolites and quantification (qNMR) of six prominent markers for standardization purposes. An increase of \u03b2-ethanolamine (MEA) reported for the first time, 5-(hydroxymethyl) furfural (5-HMF), concurrent with a reduction in chlorogenic acid, kahweol, and sucrose levels post roasting as revealed using multivariate data analyses (MVA). The diterpenes kahweol and cafestol were identified in green and roasted Coffea arabica, while 16-O-methyl cafestol in roasted C. robusta. Moreover, GC/MS identified a total of 143 metabolites belonging to 15 different chemical classes, with fructose found enriched in green C. robusta versus fatty acids abundance, i.e., palmitic and stearic acids in C. arabica confirming NMR results. These potential results aided to identify novel quality control attributes, i.e., ethanolamine, for coffee in the Middle East region and have yet to be confirmed in other coffee specimens."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
