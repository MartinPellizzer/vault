Following the use of eatable, medicinal and poisonous plants takes us into the distant past. The man's first knowledge about plants passed from generation to generation. The ancients Chinese, Egyptians, Indians, Greeks, Romans and the Old Slavs knew a large number of medicinal plants. That knowledge was carried over to other nations as well. Thanks to its geographical location and climate condition, our country is abundant and very rich in variety of species of medicinal plants. In the Middle Ages, there were written many herbal manuals that described the use and procedures in healing with medicinal plants. Many plants were known by the oldest civilizations and they were used by the people for thousands of years. Moreover, today's science has confirmed their effectiveness in the treatment of different diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Mostar, School of Medicine, Department of Internal Diseases, Bijeli Brijeg bb, 88000 Mostar, Bosnia & Hercegovina, zarko.santic@tel.net.ba."}], "LastName": "\u0160anti\u0107", "ForeName": "\u017darko", "Initials": "\u017d"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pravdi\u0107", "ForeName": "Nikolina", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bevanda", "ForeName": "Milenko", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gali\u0107", "ForeName": "Kristina", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Croatia", "MedlineTA": "Psychiatr Danub", "NlmUniqueID": "9424753", "ISSNLinking": "0353-5053"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 15th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 16th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 17th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 18th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 21st Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Medieval"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Knowledge"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29278625"]}}]}
