Reaction of L4H<sub>2</sub> with CuCl<sub>2</sub>\u00b72H<sub>2</sub>O affords the mononuclear complex [Cu(L4H<sub>2</sub>)Cl<sub>2</sub>] (1) in which the ligand acts as a neutral tridentate N,N',N'' donor, whereas treatment with a large excess of CuCl<sub>2</sub>\u00b72H<sub>2</sub>O affords the dinuclear complex [Cu<sub>2</sub>(L4H)Cl<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>OH)(H<sub>2</sub>O)] (2) in which the ligand is singly-deprotonated at the diazine, offering N,N',N'' and N,N' donor sets to two Cu(ii) ions. Reaction with Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\u00b73H<sub>2</sub>O yields the trinuclear complex, [Cu<sub>3</sub>(L4H)<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>OH)<sub>4</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>] (3) in which the ligand is again singly deprotonated, but now presents a tetradentate N,N',N'',N'''-donor set to the first Cu(ii) and behaves as an N,O-chelate to a second Cu(ii), with a conformational change from cis to trans at the diazine moiety. When the latter reaction is repeated in the presence of a mild base, a second trinuclear complex is isolated, [Cu<sub>3</sub>(L4)<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH)](NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (4) in which both the diazine and oxime functionalities of the ligand are deprotonated which subsequently bridges all three Cu(ii) ions, acting as an N,N',N'' donor to the first Cu(ii), a N,N' donor to a second Cu(ii) (similar to 2) and as a terminal O-donor to a third Cu(ii) ion. The Cu(ii) ions are linked mutually cis via the two-atom diazine bridge in the case of 2 and 4 and trans in the case of 3. Magnetic studies reveal the presence of weak ferromagnetic interactions in 2 (g = 2.2, J/k = +12.8 K) and strong antiferromagnetic interactions in both 3 and 4 (g = 2.093 J/k = -140 K and g = 2.24 J/k = -300 K respectively)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4740-5737"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Nizwa, Chair of Oman's Medicinal Plants and Marine Natural Products, P O Box 33, PC 616, Birkat Almouz, Nizwa, Oman. usman.anwar@unizwa.edu.om and Department of Chemistry and Biochemsitry, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset ave, Windsor, ON N9B3P4, Canada. jmrawson@uwindsor.ca."}], "LastName": "Anwar", "ForeName": "Muhammad U", "Initials": "MU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemsitry, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset ave, Windsor, ON N9B3P4, Canada. jmrawson@uwindsor.ca."}], "LastName": "Rawson", "ForeName": "Jeremy M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Brock University, 1812 Sir Isaac Brock Way, St. Cathaerines, ON L2S3A1, Canada."}], "LastName": "Gavey", "ForeName": "Emma L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Brock University, 1812 Sir Isaac Brock Way, St. Cathaerines, ON L2S3A1, Canada."}], "LastName": "Pilkington", "ForeName": "Melanie", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Nizwa, Chair of Oman's Medicinal Plants and Marine Natural Products, P O Box 33, PC 616, Birkat Almouz, Nizwa, Oman. usman.anwar@unizwa.edu.om."}], "LastName": "Al-Harrasi", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Deptartment of Chemistry, Memorial University, St. John's, Newfoundland A1B 3X7, Canada."}], "LastName": "Thompson", "ForeName": "Laurence K", "Initials": "LK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Dalton Trans", "NlmUniqueID": "101176026", "ISSNLinking": "1477-9226"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28154875", "10.1039/c6dt04794g"]}}]}
