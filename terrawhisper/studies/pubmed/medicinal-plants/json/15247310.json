P. quinquefolius has been harvested for more than 250 years and is now considered threatened or rare throughout its range. Plants within four protected and four unprotected populations were significantly clumped based on Ripley's univariate analysis. Analysis with Ripley's bivariate test determined that juvenile plants were significantly clumped with adult plants at the shortest distance classes in all populations. Although plants were highly clumped, we found that significant fine-scale genetic structure was restricted to the shortest distance classes based on estimates of coancestry (f(ij)). In most cases, estimates of f(ij) were more significant among juveniles than among adults, especially at the shortest distance classes. The spatial structure of ginseng seems to result from the establishment and persistence of plants in favorable microhabitats coupled with limited seed dispersal around maternal individuals. There were no differences in patterns of fine-scale genetic structure between protected and unprotected populations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology, 2502 Plant Sciences Building, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602, USA. jennifer.cruse-sanders@cgu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cruse-Sanders", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hamrick", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Hered", "NlmUniqueID": "0375373", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1503"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Demography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetics, Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Southeastern United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15247310", "10.1093/jhered/esh046", "95/4/309"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
