It occurs not only in normal cells such as cardiac muscle cells, neurons, and pancreatic acinar cells but also in various benign and malignant tumors. The abnormal level of intracellular autophagy is closely related to multiple pathophysiological processes, including aging, neurodegeneration, infectious diseases, immune disorders, and cancer. Autophagy mainly plays a dual role in life and death by regulating cell survival, proliferation, and death, thus being involved in the occurrence, development, and treatment of cancer. It is also involved in chemotherapy resistance by a dual role, since it not only promotes the occurrence of drug resistance but also reverses it. Previous findings suggest that the regulation of autophagy can be used as an effective strategy in tumor therapy.", "Recent studies found that small molecules from natural products and their derivatives exert anticancer activity by regulating the level of autophagy in tumor cells.", "Therefore, this review article describes the mechanism of autophagy, the role of autophagy in normal cells and tumor cells, and the research progress on the anticancer molecular mechanism of targets regulating cell autophagy.
