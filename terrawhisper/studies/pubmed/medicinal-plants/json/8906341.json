The determination of linear correlations between [Trp]DM and [N]DM, and between the tryptophan content in protein ([Trp]N) and [N]DM or 1/[N]DM for every species leads to the following observations: (1) [Trp]DM and [N]DM are linearly related. The data show that previous reports of similar relationships underestimate tryptophan by 10 +/- 5% owing to tryptophan degradation during alkaline hydrolysis preparatory to analysis; (2) the linear correlations between [Trp]N and 1/[N]DM, resulting from linear relationships [Trp]DM and [N]DM display coefficients of determination (r2) far lower than 1 and similar to those found for linear correlations between [Trp]N and [N]DM; (3) [Trp]N increases with [N]DM increasing for rice and pearl millet while it decreases for all other species.", "(1) linear relationships between tryptophan and nitrogen have a low predictive value; (2) the nutritional score of tryptophan of foods and feeds, as calculated from the determination of tryptophan using a procedure involving alkaline hydrolysis, is generally underestimated by 10%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Chimie Biologique, INRA, INA-PG, Thiverval Grignon, France."}], "LastName": "Delhaye", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Landry", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Adv Exp Med Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0121103", "ISSNLinking": "0065-2598"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8DUH1N11BX", "NameOfSubstance": "Tryptophan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tryptophan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8906341", "10.1007/978-1-4613-0381-7_107"]}}]}
