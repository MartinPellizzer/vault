While saliva is an important transmission conduit for these viruses, little is known about how saliva is passed to African children. We endeavoured to identify the range and determinants of acts by which African children are exposed to saliva.", "To identify the range of acts by which African children are exposed to saliva, we conducted focus groups, semi-structured interviews and participant observations in an urban and a rural community in South Africa. To measure the prevalence and determinants of the identified acts, we administered a questionnaire to a population-based sample of caregivers.", "We identified 12 caregiving practices that expose a child's oral-respiratory mucosa, cutaneous surfaces or anal-rectal mucosa to saliva. Several acts were heretofore not described in the contemporary literature (e.g., caregiver inserting finger lubricated with saliva into child's rectum to relieve constipation). Among 896 participants in the population-based survey, many of the acts were commonly practised by all respondent types (mothers, fathers, grandmothers and siblings). The most common were premastication of food, sharing sweets and premastication of medicinal plants that are spit onto a child's body.", "African children are exposed to saliva through a variety of acts, practised by a variety of caregivers, with no single predominant practice. This diversity poses challenges for epidemiologic work seeking to identify specific saliva-passing practices that transmit viruses. Most acts could be replaced by other actions and are theoretically preventable."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, USA. lmbutler@gmail.com <lmbutler@gmail.com>"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Butler", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neilands", "ForeName": "T B", "Initials": "TB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mosam", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mzolo", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martin", "ForeName": "J N", "Initials": "JN"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "K01 HD052020", "Acronym": "HD", "Agency": "NICHD NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Trop Med Int Health", "NlmUniqueID": "9610576", "ISSNLinking": "1360-2276"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Activities of Daily Living"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caregivers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Child Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["transmission"], "DescriptorName": "Cytomegalovirus Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["transmission"], "DescriptorName": "Epstein-Barr Virus Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Focus Groups"}, {"QualifierName": ["transmission"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatitis B"}, {"QualifierName": ["transmission"], "DescriptorName": "Herpesviridae Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Population"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Saliva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}, {"QualifierName": ["transmission"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Beasley RP, Hwang LY, Lin CC, Chien CS.
