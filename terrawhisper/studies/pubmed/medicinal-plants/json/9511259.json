Despite the equivocal character of action hepatoprotective drugs are used, despite the fact that the effect is partly a placebo effect. In the literature are reports on preparation LIV 52 which is a mixture of substances of plant origin and improves the subjective complaints of patients as well as the objective condition of patients with liver disease.", "The effect of preparation LIV 52 was investigated in a retrospective study in 19 patients with liver damage. In the majority liver damage caused by alcohol was involved, steatosis and persisting hepatitis without the finding of chronic hepatitis B and C. The authors investigated biochemical parameters (bilirubin, ALT, AST, ALP, TZR, cholesterol). The size of the liver was assessed by ultrasonography and the subjective status of the patients was recorded. Within one year of administration of the preparation subjective improvement occurred, hepatomegaly diminished and the activity of aminotransferases declined.", "Administration of LIV 52 can improve the subjective condition and clinical parameters in patients with liver damage, in particular in alcoholic liver damage and in steatosis. The effect is certainly due also to better motivation on the patients part, better lifestyle and dietary measures. After one year of treatment no undesirable side-effects were detected."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "I. intern\u00ed klinika 1, LF UK a VFN, Praha."}], "LastName": "Kal\u00e1b", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Krechler", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Vliv hepatoprotektiva LIV 52 na jatern\u00ed poskozeni."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Czech Republic", "MedlineTA": "Cas Lek Cesk", "NlmUniqueID": "0004743", "ISSNLinking": "0008-7335"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "54847-94-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Liv 52"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "3", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9511259"]}}]}
