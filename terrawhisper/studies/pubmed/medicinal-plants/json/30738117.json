Some of the medicinal plants used by the community exhibits established pharmacological activities which signify the importance of the traditional knowledge of the tribes. Besides, many other species traditionally used by the tribes assume to have pharmacological potentiality.", "The study aimed to identify the medicinally and pharmacologically important species with understanding the traditional healing practices and to compare medicinal plant knowledge among the informants of the three tribes under Zeliangrong group.", "Data were collected by interviewing selected 27 herbal healers using modified semi-structured questionnaires. Identification and documentation of all the species have been made using standard taxonomic procedure. Ethnomedicinal uses of all the recorded species was analyzed with computation of the use reports for each species and Informant Consensus Factor.", "The study recorded 145 medicinal plants used in healing practices by the Zeliangrong tribes. Except 2 species, all are Angiospermic plants found mostly in wild condition. These medicinal plants are used for treating about 59 different health ailments categorized under 13 ICPC disease categories. Highest ICF (0.75) was found in Digestive disorder with 174 use reports for 44 plant species. Besides the established medicinal plants in the Indian System of medicine like Acorus calamus, Centella asiatica, Oroxylum indicum and Phyllanthus emblica, a number of other species like Ageratum conizoides, Blumeopsis flava, Clerodendrum glandulosum, Gynura cusimbua, Hedyotis scandens and Paederia foetida also has maximum use reports. Among the species with higher use reports, 2 species namely Clerodendrum glandulosum and Paederia foetida are exclusively used for the treatment of hypertension, and bone fracture and sprain respectively indicating their remarkable medicinal values and acceptability. Out of the total 145 species, only 24 are shared by all the three tribes with 11 species used for similar diseases.", "The medicinal plants with higher use reports can be evaluated for validation of pharmacological activities and their toxicity. The Indigenous Knowledge System of Zeliangrong community for herbal remedies may be of immense value in pharmacological experimentation particularly for the uses like malaria, health tonic, cancer, jaundice, hypertension and diabetes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
