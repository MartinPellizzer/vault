{"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"OtherAbstract": [{"AbstractText": ["The chief causes of liver disease in Ethiopia are reviewed, considering hospital data on admissions for hepatitis, cirrhosis, ascites and hepatoma. Liver diseases account for 11.4% of all medical admissions in 3 medical wards in Addis Ababa. The causes are viral hepatitis, post- hepatic and post necrotic and mixed cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Alcoholic cirrhosis is rare. Viral hepatitis with shivering, rigor and fever and elevated direct bilirubin levels are common in Ethiopians, especially in child-bearing women. The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is often associated with hepatitis. The disease may be transmitted by several species of mosquitoes, placental transmission, or feces, urine, saliva or semen. Blood products are not screened for hepatitis B. Cirrhosis is common, and causes significant mortality, usually from esophageal varices and hepatic coma. Chronic active hepatitis patients may live for a time, especially if they are near a hospital and are treated with steroids. In Ethiopia presenting symptoms for hepatoma are anorexia, weight loss, persistent, burning, right upper quadrant pain, and a hard, nodular, tender RUQ mass. Over 5% of malignancies seen are primary hepatocellular carcinomas. 50% have HBsAG, compared to 3.8% of controls. 65% have alpha-fetoglobulins. It is suggested that some viral hepatitis cases progress to cirrhosis, of which some go on to hepatocellular carcinoma. Herbal medicines, aflatoxins and other toxins may also contribute to liver disease."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["054852", "00198779"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: ETHIOPIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Africa", "Africa South Of The Sahara", "Alcohol Drinking", "Behavior", "Biology", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Diseases", "Eastern Africa", "Ethiopia", "Health", "Health Facilities", "Health Services", "Hospitals", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Liver Neoplasms", "Maternal-fetal Exchange", "Medicine", "Neoplasms", "Plants, Medicinal", "Pregnancy", "Reproduction", "Risk Factors", "Viral Diseases"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "201462", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1978", "Month": "02", "Day": "18"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "04"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0014-1755", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "15", "Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1977", "Month": "Apr"}}, "Title": "Ethiopian medical journal", "ISOAbbreviation": "Ethiop Med J"}, "ArticleTitle": "Current views on liver diseases in Ethiopia.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "75", "EndPage": "82", "MedlinePgn": "75-82"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tsega", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ethiopia", "MedlineTA": "Ethiop Med J", "NlmUniqueID": "0373223", "ISSNLinking": "0014-1755"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethiopia"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "transmission"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatitis, Viral, Human"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Cirrhosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["201462"]}}]}
