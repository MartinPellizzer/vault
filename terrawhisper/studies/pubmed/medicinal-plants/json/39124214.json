Seeds by Reducing Indole-3-Acetic Acid (IAA) Levels.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Smoke-water (SW) and Karrikinolide1 (KAR<sub>1</sub>) release dormancy and improve seed germination in many plant species. Therefore, we tested SW (1:2500 <i>v</i>/<i>v</i>) and KAR<sub>1</sub> (10<sup>-7</sup> M) to break the morphological dormancy of celery cultivar (<i>Apium graveolens</i> L.). In the first trial, seeds were subjected to a 21-day incubation period at 20 \u00b0C with SW and KAR<sub>1</sub> applied as single treatments. KAR<sub>1</sub> showed significantly improved germination (30.7%) as compared to SW (17.2%) and a water control (14.7%). In seed soaking experiments, SW, KAR<sub>1</sub>, and gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>) treatments showed higher germination percentages than the water control after 3 and 6 h of soaking. However, prolonged soaking (12 h) reduced germination percentages for all treatments, indicating a detrimental effect. Analysis of KAR<sub>1</sub> content dynamics in 7-day- and 21-day-old celery seeds indicated its prolonged effects on germination and dormancy alleviation. Phytohormones, including auxins in 7-day-old and cytokinins in 7-day- and 21-day-old celery seedlings, along with their precursors and metabolites, were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) after treatment with KAR<sub>1</sub> and SW. The analysis of auxin levels in 7-day-old seeds revealed a negative correlation between seed germination and auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) content. Notably, it was found that KAR<sub>1</sub>-treated seeds significantly reduced IAA levels in all treatments. SW and KAR<sub>1</sub> did not significantly affect cytokinin levels during celery germination except for N6-Isopentenyladenine. Hence, further research is needed to understand their precise role in celery seed germination. This work will improve our understanding of the role of bioactive compounds from plant-derived smoke and how they regulate hormonal responses and improve germination efficiency in celery."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Growth Regulators, Faculty of Science, Palack\u00fd University & Institute of Experimental Botany AS CR, v.v.i, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 11, 78371 Olomouc, Czech Republic."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Plant Growth and Development, School of Life Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal Pietermaritzburg, Private Bag X01, Scottsville 3209, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Shubhpriya", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Growth Regulators, Faculty of Science, Palack\u00fd University & Institute of Experimental Botany AS CR, v.v.i, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 11, 78371 Olomouc, Czech Republic."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Biology, Faculty of Science, Palack\u00fd University, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 11, 78371 Olomouc, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Hrdli\u010dka", "ForeName": "Jakub", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9656-4676"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Plant Growth and Development, School of Life Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal Pietermaritzburg, Private Bag X01, Scottsville 3209, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Kulkarni", "ForeName": "Manoj", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Growth Regulators, Faculty of Science, Palack\u00fd University & Institute of Experimental Botany AS CR, v.v.i, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 11, 78371 Olomouc, Czech Republic."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetic Resources for Vegetables, Medicinal and Special Plants, Crop Research Institute, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 29, 78371 Olomouc, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Dole\u017ealova", "ForeName": "Ivana", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1314-2249"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Growth Regulators, Faculty of Science, Palack\u00fd University & Institute of Experimental Botany AS CR, v.v.i, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 11, 78371 Olomouc, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "P\u011bn\u010d\u00edk", "ForeName": "Ale\u0161", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0515-1281"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Plant Growth and Development, School of Life Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal Pietermaritzburg, Private Bag X01, Scottsville 3209, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Van Staden", "ForeName": "Johannes", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3452-0154"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Growth Regulators, Faculty of Science, Palack\u00fd University & Institute of Experimental Botany AS CR, v.v.i, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 11, 78371 Olomouc, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Nov\u00e1k", "ForeName": "Ond\u0159ej", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4938-0350"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Growth Regulators, Faculty of Science, Palack\u00fd University & Institute of Experimental Botany AS CR, v.v.i, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 11, 78371 Olomouc, Czech Republic."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Biology, Faculty of Science, Palack\u00fd University, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 11, 78371 Olomouc, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Dole\u017eal", "ForeName": "Karel", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Plants (Basel)", "NlmUniqueID": "101596181", "ISSNLinking": "2223-7747"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "48"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "6"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39124214", "10.3390/plants13152096", "plants13152096"]}}]}
