About 46.8 million people are reported to have dementia, and AD is mainly responsible for dementia in aged people. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to occur due to the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) in the neocortex portion of the brain, nitric oxide mediated dysfunctioning of blood-brain barrier, reduced activity of serine racemase enzyme, cell cycle disturbances, damage of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and glutamatergic neurotransmission. Modern treatment methods target the pathways responsible for the disease. To date, solely symptomatic treatments exist for this disease, all making an attempt to counterbalance the neurotransmitter disturbance. Treatments able to prevent or at least effectively modifying the course of AD, referred to as 'disease-modifying' drugs, are still under extensive research. Effective treatments entail a better indulgence of the herbal bioactives by novel drug delivery systems. The herbal bioactive administered by novel drug delivery systems have proved beneficial in treating this disease. This review provides detailed information about the role of medicinal plants and their formulations in treating Alzheimer's disease which will be highly beneficial for the researchers working in this area."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Balbir", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Hasandeep", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Brahmjot", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Navkaran", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botanical and Environmental Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, India."}], "LastName": "Rajput", "ForeName": "Ankita", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, India."}], "LastName": "Sidhu", "ForeName": "Disha", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, India."}], "LastName": "Kaur", "ForeName": "Amandeep", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botanical and Environmental Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, India."}], "LastName": "Arora", "ForeName": "Saroj", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, India."}], "LastName": "Kaur", "ForeName": "Sarabjit", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Deliv", "NlmUniqueID": "101208455", "ISSNLinking": "1567-2018"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "48"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34779370", "10.2174/1567201818666211015152733", "CDD-EPUB-118483"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
