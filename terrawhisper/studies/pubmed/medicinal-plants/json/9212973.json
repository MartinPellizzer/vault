Four kinds of antisera were elicited in rabbits immunized with GRs of different botanical origins. The presence of the characteristic GR protein (GRP) was shown using Western blot analyses and selected antibody enzyme immunoassay (SAEIA) methods. A GRP was isolated from one of the GR specimens which was selected using SAEIA methods. The isolated GRP was heated to reduce its binding activity to an anti-GR serum. A new fuzzy SAEIA method generally applicable for assay of the extract of the ten GR specimens was developed using heat-treated GRP as the solid-phase antigen. The fuzzy SAEIA method was successfully applied for the detection and quantitative analysis of the GR component contained in traditional Chinese medicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kitagawa", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fujiwara", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Akahori", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sonoi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kondo", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "H Z", "Initials": "HZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoenzyme Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9212973", "10.1248/bpb.20.589"]}}]}
