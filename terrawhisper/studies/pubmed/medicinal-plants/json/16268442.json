Most were carried out in developed countries. Standard methodological principles were applied in almost all the trials: randomisation (85.4%), comparison (87.5%) versus placebo (95.2%), and blinded design (81.3%). The duration of the studies was short. Sample sizes were generally small, ranging from 30 to 99 subjects; statistical tests were used in 90% of the trials. Adverse effects were infrequently collected.", "Most clinical trials included in this survey were conducted in accordance with WHO guidelines.
