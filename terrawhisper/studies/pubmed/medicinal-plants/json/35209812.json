Literature suggests that biologically active phytomolecules may exert anticancer properties by regulating several signaling pathways. Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, has various pharmacological applications to combat severe diseases like cancer. Mechanistically, it inhibits cell proliferation and invasion, suppresses tumor angiogenesis, and induces cell apoptosis. The antitumoral effect of berberine in GBM is increasingly recognized. This review sheds new light on the regulatory signaling mechanisms of berberine in various cancers, proposing its potential role as a therapeutic agent for GBM."], "CopyrightInformation":
