In microgravity, there were strong oscillations of the root tip, even when the seedlings were grown first on the 1 x g centrifuge [F(1 x g + microg)]. In the [F(microg + 1 x g)] sample, the roots grown in microgravity were oblique with respect to the 1 x g acceleration when the seedlings were placed on the centrifuge. They were therefore gravistimulated. However, root length was similar in the 4 samples after 29 h of growth and growth rate of the root was the same between 25 h and 29 h although it appeared to be slightly greater in the [F(microg + 1 x g)] sample. Cell elongation was analysed as a function of the distance from the root cap junction. Cell length was similar in the seedlings grown in microgravity or on the 1 x g centrifuge. The transfer from the 1 x g centrifuge to microgravity [F(1 x g + microg)] did not modify cell elongation in the roots. Cell length in the roots which were grown in microgravity and gravistimulated [F(microg + 1 x g)] was different from that observed in microgravity but this was only due to gravistimulation. Thus, gravity does not have an effect on cell elongation when the roots are strictly oriented in the vertical position but it does as soon as the root tip deviates from this orientation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Cytologie Exp\u00e9rimentale et Morphogen\u00e8se V\u00e9g\u00e9tale, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France."}], "LastName": "Legu\u00e9", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Driss-Ecole", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Perbal", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8411927", "ISSNLinking": "0168-1656"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Centrifugation"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gravitropism"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Root Cap"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Space Flight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weightlessness"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11536755", "10.1016/0168-1656(96)01356-9", "0168-1656(96)01356-9"]}}]}
