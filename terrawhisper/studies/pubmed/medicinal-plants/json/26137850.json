This study compared the efficacy of an herbal compound containing Malva sylvestris and Alcea digitata (Boiss) with artificial saliva (Hypozalix) for improving the symptoms of dry mouth in head and neck cancer patients. The study examined a total of 62 subjects assigned to 2 groups. The herbal compound and Hypozalix were administered for 4 weeks. Efficacy was assessed using the visual analog scale and by grading the degree of dry mouth. Both groups showed a significant difference between visual analog scale before and following intervention. There was also a significant difference in visual analog scale between groups at 4 weeks after onset of intervention. The herbal group showed a significant difference between the grade of dry mouth before and after intervention, but no change was observed for grade of dry mouth in the Hypozalix group. This study supports the efficacy of the herbal compound for controlling symptoms of dry mouth in head and neck cancer patients."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2015."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Imam Hossein Hospital, ShahidBeheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ameri", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Medicine, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran ghazalrad@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Heydarirad", "ForeName": "Ghazaleh", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Persian Medicine & Pharmacy Research Center, School of traditional Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Science."}], "LastName": "Rezaeizadeh", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Medicine, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Choopani", "ForeName": "Rasool", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional pharmacy, faculty of traditional medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghobadi", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Gachkar", "ForeName": "Latif", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Evid Based Complementary Altern Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101556804", "ISSNLinking": "2156-5899"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saliva, Artificial"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "radiotherapy"], "DescriptorName": "Head and Neck Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Malva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Radiotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saliva, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Xerostomia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26137850", "10.1177/2156587215590232", "2156587215590232"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
