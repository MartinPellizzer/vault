In addition, it is known that metabolites of medicinal plants are inhibitors of the quorum sensing system in bacteria. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of <i>Quercus cortex</i> extract in a reduced dose on the productivity and body state of healthy chicken broilers.", "For the experiment, 120 heads of 7-day-old healthy broiler chickens were selected, and they were divided into four groups (n=30, 3 replicates of 10 birds in each group) by the analog method. The composition of diets of the experimental Groups I and II additionally included <i>Q. cortex</i> extract and Groups II and III included an enzyme preparation containing glucoamylase and concomitant cellulolytic enzymes. The following methods of study were used; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, mass spectrometry and atomic emission spectrometry, and hematological analysis.", "It was established that the increase in live weight of broiler chickens in experimental groups exceeded the analogous indicator in the control group by 3.1-16.6%, and feed intake within the entire experimental period increased by 2.6-15.4%, against a background of decreasing feed consumption for a weight gain of 1 kg of live weight (by 3.7-9.2%). There was an increase in iron concentration in blood of broiler chickens in Groups I and II (7.8-11.8%), in liver (23.7-92.4%, p\u22640.05), and in spleen (53.9-77.7%, \u0440\u22640.05) against the background of a decrease in muscle tissue. A decreased content of monocytes and granulocytes was found, especially in experimental Group I.", "In the experiment, it was shown for the first time that the inclusion of <i>Q. cortex</i> extract in an enzyme-containing diet (anti-quarantine substances) was found to increase the productivity of poultry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Feeding Agricultural Animals and Fodder Technology, All-Russian Research Institute of Beef Cattle Breeding, Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations, Orenburg, 460000, Russia."}], "LastName": "Duskaev", "ForeName": "Galimzhan Kalihanovich", "Initials": "GK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Feeding Agricultural Animals and Fodder Technology, All-Russian Research Institute of Beef Cattle Breeding, Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations, Orenburg, 460000, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Biotechnology, Orenburg State University, Orenburg, 460018, Russia."}], "LastName": "Kazachkova", "ForeName": "Nadezhda Mihajlovna", "Initials": "NM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Feeding Poultry, All-Russia Research and Technological Institute of Poultry, Sergiev Posad, 141311, Russia."}], "LastName": "Ushakov", "ForeName": "Alexander Sergeevich", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Feeding Agricultural Animals and Fodder Technology, All-Russian Research Institute of Beef Cattle Breeding, Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations, Orenburg, 460000, Russia."}], "LastName": "Nurzhanov", "ForeName": "Baer Serekpaevich", "Initials": "BS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Feeding Agricultural Animals and Fodder Technology, All-Russian Research Institute of Beef Cattle Breeding, Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations, Orenburg, 460000, Russia."}], "LastName": "Rysaev", "ForeName": "Albert Farhitdinovich", "Initials": "AF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Vet World", "NlmUniqueID": "101504872", "ISSNLinking": "0972-8988"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Diarra M.S, Silversides F.G, Diarrassouba F, Pritchard J, Masson L, Brousseau R, Bonnet C, Delaquis P, Bach S, Skura B, Topp E.
