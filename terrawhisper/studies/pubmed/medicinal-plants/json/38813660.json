Borneol acetyltransferase (BAT) is an alcohol acetyltransferase, which catalyzes borneol and acetyl-CoA to synthesize bornyl acetate (BA). However, the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of BA have so far only been characterized in <i>Wurfbainia villosa</i>, the studies on the WvBATs have only been conducted <i>in vitro</i>, and the catalytic activity was relatively low. In this research, three genes (<i>WlBAT1</i>, <i>WlBAT2</i>, and <i>WlBAT3</i>) have been identified to encode BATs that are capable of acetylating borneol to synthesize BA <i>in vitro</i>. We also determined that WlBAT1 has the highest catalytic efficiency for borneol-type substrates, including (+)-borneol, (-)-borneol, and isoborneol. Furthermore, we found that BATs could catalyze a wide range of substrate types <i>in vitro</i>, but <i>in vivo</i>, they exclusively catalyzed borneol-type substrates. Through molecular simulations and site-directed mutagenesis, it was revealed that residues D32, N36, H168, N297, N355, and H384 are crucial for the catalytic activity of WlBAT1, while the R382I-D385R double mutant of WlBAT1 exhibited an increasing acylation efficiency for borneol-type substrates <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. These findings offer key genetic elements for the metabolic engineering of plants and synthetic biology to produce BA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicinal Resource from Lingnan (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Science, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yuanxia", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicinal Resource from Lingnan (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Science, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Tiantian", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicinal Resource from Lingnan (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Science, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Huilin", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicinal Resource from Lingnan (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Science, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Dongming", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicinal Resource from Lingnan (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Science, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Zhan", "ForeName": "Ruoting", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicinal Resource from Lingnan (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Science, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jinfen", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0005-2340-0415"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicinal Resource from Lingnan (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Science, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Synthetic Biology of Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hunan University of Medicine, Huaihua 418000, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Camphanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L88RA8N5EG", "NameOfSubstance": "isoborneol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Camphanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biocatalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "35"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38813660", "10.1021/acs.jafc.4c02915"]}}]}
