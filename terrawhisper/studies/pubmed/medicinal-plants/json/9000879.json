(Papaveraceae), were tested for their action against the growth of human keratinocytes. Cell proliferation was independently determined by directly counting the cells and in the colorimetric MTT assay. Sanguinarine potently inhibited cell growth with an IC50 of 0.2 microM. Chelidonine, the main alkaloid of Ch. majus, was much less efficient. The extract of the herb of Ch. majus was also effective with an IC50 of 1.9 microM, calculated on the basis of its alkaloid content in terms of chelidonine. Keratinocytes were further tested for their susceptibility for the action of sanguinarine and chelerythrine on plasma membrane integrity, which resulted in a twofold increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity as compared to controls. On the other hand, the activity of the extract of the herb of Ch. majus was due to cytostatic rather than cytotoxic effects, as LDH release was unchanged as compared to controls."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Chemistry, Palack\u00fd University, Olomouc, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Vavreckov\u00e1", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gawlik", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "M\u00fcller", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Keratinocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9000879", "10.1055/s-2006-957955"]}}]}
