Since the biomarkers and mechanisms of RA in the treatment of hyperlipidemia are inadequate, ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight synapt high-definition mass spectrometry and multivariate data analysis were employed to investigate the urinary metabolomics of RA on hyperlipidemic rats induced by high-fat diet. The metabolic profile of RA-treated hyperlipidemic group located between control and diet-induced hyperlipidemic groups. Nineteen metabolites with significant fluctuations were identified as potential biomarkers related to the hyperlipidemia and anti-hyperlipidemia of RA using partial least-squares-discriminate analysis, heatmap analysis and correlation coefficient analysis. The fluctuations of these biomarkers represented disturbances in amino acid metabolism, purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism and energy metabolism. After RA treatment, these perturbed metabolites were restored to normal or nearly normal levels. RA can alleviate high-fat diet-induced dysfunctions in these metabolic pathways."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, The College of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Miao", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nephrology, Xi'an No. 4 Hospital, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, The College of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Dan-Qian", "Initials": "DQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, The College of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, The College of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Ying-Yong", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, State Food and Drug Administration, Tiantan Xili, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Shuang-Cheng", "Initials": "SC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alisma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Diet, High-Fat"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperlipidemias"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Least-Squares Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27571931", "10.1002/bmc.3829"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
