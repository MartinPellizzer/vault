However, during incubation of the LHCP precursor with a chloroplast-soluble extract in an organelle-free processing reaction, the NH2 terminus is cleaved, yielding only a 25-kDa peptide. In the present study, mutations at the transit peptide-mature protein junction were introduced in the LHCP precursor to investigate the relationship between the two peptides and the determinants of proteolytic processing. Mutant p delta 3 lacks 3 amino acids including Met34 at the primary cleavage site thought to give rise to the 26-kDa peptide. It is still processed during import and in the organelle-free reaction yielding in both assays only a 25-kDa peptide. Mutant p + 4 has 4 amino acids inserted immediately after Met34 and a proline that disrupts the alpha-helix predicted by the Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson method (Garnier, J., Osguthorpe, D. J., and Robson, B. (1978) J. Mol. Biol. 120, 97-120) to extend through this region. Although p + 4 is imported, it is inefficiently processed; both a 25- and 26-kDa peptide are found, but at least 60% of the imported precursor remains uncleaved. Less than 5% is processed in the organelle-free assay. Replacement of the predicted alpha-helix in the mutant p + 4 alpha restores processing upon import into the chloroplast, but this mutant, which also has a 4-amino acid insert, yields only a 26-kDa peptide. p + 4 alpha is not processed in the organelle-free reaction. These results provide evidence that the two forms of LHCP obtained during import are the result of independent processing at two cleavage sites: the first site at Met34, and a second approximately 10 amino acids downstream within what has been designated the NH2 terminus of the mature protein. Whereas p delta 3 has the first site removed but retains a functional second site, in p + 4 alpha only the first site, or one very near it, is accessible to the processing enzyme during import. The conditions of the organelle-free reaction are specific for processing at only the secondary site. We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of the heterogeneity of LHCP in vivo."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, University of Chicago, Illinois 60637."}], "LastName": "Clark", "ForeName": "S E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abad", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lamppa", "ForeName": "G K", "Initials": "GK"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM36419", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Precursors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.27", "NameOfSubstance": "Thermolysin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Precursors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Thermolysin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2677009", "S0021-9258(18)71526-3"]}}]}
