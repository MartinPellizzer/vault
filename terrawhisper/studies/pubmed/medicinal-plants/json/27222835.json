The susceptibility test was based on the M27-A2 methodology. The chemical compositions of the essential oils were obtained by gas chromatography- mass spectroscopy (GC-MS).", "In GC-MS analysis, thymol (63.40%), linalool (42%), \u03b1-pinene (27.87%), \u03b1-pinene (22.10%), and zingiberene (31.79%) were found to be the major components of T. ammi, O. vulgare, My. communis, Ma. chamomilla and Z. officinale roscoe, respectively. The results showed that essential oils have different levels of antifungal activity. O. vulgare and T. ammi essential oils were found to be the most efficient (P<0.05). The main finding was that the susceptibilities of FLU-resistant C. albicans to essential oils were higher than those of the FLU-susceptible yeasts.", "Results of this study indicated that the oils from medicinal plants could be used as potential anti FLU-resistant C. albicans agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mycology Research Center, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sharifzadeh", "ForeName": "Aghil", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Amol University of Special Modern Technologies, Amol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shokri", "ForeName": "Hojjatollah", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Avicenna J Phytomed", "NlmUniqueID": "101586220", "ISSNLinking": "2228-7930"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Abbaszadeh S, Sharifzadeh A, Shokri H, Khosravi AR, Abbaszadeh A.
