In this study, a new concept of lead chemome and an efficient strategy to discover lead chemome were proposed. Compared with the concept of lead compound, lead chemome can provide not only the starting point for drug development, but also the direction for structure optimization. Two traditional Chinese medicines of Mahonia bealei and Mahonia fortunei were used as examples to illustrate the strategy. Based on natural chromatogram-effect correlation (NCEC), berberine, palmatine and jatrorrhizine were discovered as acetylcholinesterase (AchE) inhibitors. Taking the three compounds as template molecules, a lead chemome consisting of 10 structurally related natural compounds were generated through natural structure-effect correlation (NSEC). In the lead chemome, the IC<sub>50</sub> values of jatrorrhizine, berberine, coptisine, palmatine and epiberberine are at nanomolar level, which are comparable to a widely used drug of galantamine. Pharmacophore modeling shows that the positive ionizable group and aromatic rings are important substructures for AchE inhibition. Molecular docking further shows that pi-cation interaction and pi-pi stacking are critical for compounds to maintain nanomolar IC<sub>50</sub> values. The structure-activity information is helpful for drug design and structure optimization. This work also expanded the traditional understanding of \"stem is the medicinal part of Mahonia bealei and Mahonia fortunei\". Actually, all parts except the leaf of Mahonia bealei exhibited potent AchE-inhibitory activity. This study provides not only a strategy to discover lead chemome for modern drug development, but also a reference for the application of different parts of medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
