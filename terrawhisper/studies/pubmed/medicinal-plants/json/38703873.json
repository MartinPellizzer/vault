Bioassay-guided isolation of bioactives from medicinal plants is recognized as a potential approach for the discovery of novel drug candidates. In particular, non-addictive painkillers are of special interest among herbal phytochemicals.", "The current study aimed to assess the safety of J. thurifera, J. phoenicea, and J. oxycedrus aqueous extracts in oral treatments; validating the traditionally reported anti-in\ufb02ammatory and analgesic effects. Further phytochemical investigations, especially for the most bioactive species, may lead to isolation of bioactive metabolites responsible for such bioactivities supported with in vitro enzyme inhibition assays.", "Firstly, the acute toxicity study was investigated following the OECD Guidelines. Then, the antinociceptive, and anti-inflammatory bioactivities were evaluated based on chemical and mechanical trauma assays and investigated their underlying mechanisms. The most active J. thurifera n-butanol fraction was subjected to chromatographic studies for isolating the major anti-inflammatory metabolites. Moreover, several enzymatic inhibition assays (e.g., 5-lipoxygenase, protease, elastase, collagenase, and tyrosinase) were assessed for the crude extracts and isolated compounds.", "The results showed that acute oral administration of the extracts (300-500\u00a0mg/kg, p. o.) inhibited both mechanically and chemically triggered inflammatory edema in mice (up to 70% in case of J. thurifera) with a dose-dependent antinociceptive (tail flick) and anti-inflammatory pain (formalin assay) activities. This effect was partially mediated by naloxone inhibition of the opioid receptor (2\u00a0mg/kg, i. p.). In addition, 3-methoxy gallic acid (1), quercetin (2), kaempferol (3), and ellagic acid (4) were successfully identified being involved most likely in J. thurifera extract bioactivities. Nevertheless, quercetin was found to be the most potent against 5-LOX, tyrosinase, and protease with IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01, 192.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.20, and 399\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.05\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively.", "J. thurifera extract with its major metabolites are prospective drug candidates for inflammatory pain supported with inhibition of inflammatory enzymes. Interestingly, antagonism of opioid and non-opioid receptors is potentially involved."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
