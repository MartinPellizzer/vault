Pentatropis spiralis, Calotropis procera, Helitropium curassavicum, Withania somnifera and Chenopodium album showed reducing power ranging from 34% to 146%. Suaeda fruticosa, Trianthema portulacastrum, Pluchea lanceolata and Rumex dentatus has excellent antioxidant potential proved by their DPPH scavenging and reducing power. 1000\u00b5g/10\u00b5l chloroform extract of S. fruticosa gave 92% scavenging with IC50 value less than 0.7\u00b5g/10\u00b5l while its hexane extract possessed 80% reducing activity at 100\u00b5g/10\u00b5l concentration. DPPH free radical scavenging by methanolic extract of Trianthema portulacastrum was 60% and 76% at 1000 and 100\u00b5g/10\u00b5l respectively with IC50 value of 0.03\u00b5g/10\u00b5l while the reducing activity of 124% at 100\u00b5g/10\u00b5l. Methanolic extract of P. lanceolata showed 91% and 70% scavenging activity at 1000 and 100\u00b5g/10\u00b5l with IC50 value of 0.7\u00b5g/ 10\u00b5l. Reducing power is comparable with the reference BHA standard that is 98% at 100\u00b5g/10\u00b5l concentration. Rumex dentatus' extracts are excellent DPPH scavengers and hydrogen donators produced 156% reduction. Chloroform extract was inefficient antioxidant. These results make these plants a candidate for future research for treating ailments due to imbalance in free radicals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Lateef", "ForeName": "Mehreen", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Farheen", "ForeName": "Sadia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food and Marine Research Center, Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Naqvi", "ForeName": "Beena", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Iqbal", "ForeName": "Lubna", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Siddiqui", "ForeName": "Kauser", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "56"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33191239"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
