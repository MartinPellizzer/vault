Many of the available dietary supplements contain a multitude of ingredients, the source and/or purity of which is seldom disclosed; some of these may have biologic effects of their own or may interact with other supplements or drugs, often leading to adverse effects. The most well-documented evidence published to date is on the inhibitory action of natural compounds, especially flavonoids, on mast cells and allergic symptoms. Some flavonoids have weak inhibitory activity, whereas others may have no benefit or may be detrimental. Sulfated proteoglycans could provide synergistic action but require formulations with increased absorption.", "Combining the most active flavonoids with proteoglycans could be helpful in atopic and inflammatory conditions. However, a complete list of active ingredients and their source, purity, and exact concentration should be a requirement for nutraceuticals to standardize, compare, and promote their safe use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Tufts University School of Medicine and Tufts-New England Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA. theoharis.theoharides@tufts.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Theoharides", "ForeName": "Theoharis C", "Initials": "TC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bielory", "ForeName": "Leonard", "Initials": "L"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "AR47662", "Acronym": "AR", "Agency": "NIAMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "DK42409", "Acronym": "DK", "Agency": "NIDDK NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "DK44815", "Acronym": "DK", "Agency": "NIDDK NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "NS38326", "Acronym": "NS", "Agency": "NINDS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R13 AT01224-01", "Acronym": "AT", "Agency": "NCCIH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "9503580", "ISSNLinking": "1081-1206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inflammation Mediators"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mast Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}], "NumberOfReferences": "158"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15330009", "10.1016/s1081-1206(10)61484-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
