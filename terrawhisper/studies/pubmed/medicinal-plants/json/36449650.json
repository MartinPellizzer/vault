The causative agent Plasmodium falciparum is resistant to several currently available anti-malarial drugs, such as mefloquine, chloroquine, and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), and this has been a major global challenge towards the control of the disease. There is urgent need for novel anti-malarial chemotherapeutic agents.", "The present study aimed to evaluate antimalarial activity of methanolic extracts of three Bangladeshi medicinal plants- Acorus calamus, Dichapetalum gelonioides and Leucas aspera - against both chloroquine sensitive (3D7) and resistant (Dd2) strains of P. falciparum. Histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) based ELISA was used to evaluate the in vitro inhibitory activity of the extracts.", "D. gelonioides extract showed moderate (IC50 = 19.15 \u00b5g/mL) and promising activity (IC50 = 10.43 \u00b5g/mL) against 3D7 and Dd2 strains respectively. A. calamus remained inactive against both 3D7 (IC50 = 72.29 \u00b5g/mL) and Dd2 strain (IC50 = 67.81 \u00b5g/mL). L. aspera initially remained inactive against 3D7 strain (IC50 = 60.51 \u00b5g/mL), but displayed promising activity (IC50 = 7.693) against Dd2 strain.", "This is the first time these plant materials have been assessed for their in vitro antimalarial properties. It is pivotal to conduct further phytochemical analysis of D. gelonioides and L. aspera to evaluate the presence of potential novel antimalarial drug compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2022 Md Fahad Zamil, Saiful Arefeen Sazed, Muhammad Riadul Haque Hossainey, Anik Biswas, Mohammad Shafiul Alam, Hamida Khanum, Priyanka Barua."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh (icddr,b), Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Zamil", "ForeName": "Md Fahad", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh (icddr,b), Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Arefeen Sazed", "ForeName": "Saiful", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh (icddr,b), Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Haque Hossainey", "ForeName": "Muhammad Riadul", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Biswas", "ForeName": "Anik", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh (icddr,b), Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Alam", "ForeName": "Mohammad Shafiul", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Khanum", "ForeName": "Hamida", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh. baruap@du.ac.bd."}], "LastName": "Barua", "ForeName": "Priyanka", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "J Infect Dev Ctries", "NlmUniqueID": "101305410", "ISSNLinking": "1972-2680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimalarials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "886U3H6UFF", "NameOfSubstance": "Chloroquine"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Leucas aspera"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimalarials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plasmodium falciparum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acorus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chloroquine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Malaria, Falciparum"}], "CoiStatement": "No Conflict of Interest is declared"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36449650", "10.3855/jidc.16741"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
