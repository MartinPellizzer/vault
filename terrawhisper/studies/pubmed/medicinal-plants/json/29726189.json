These data were analyzed by traditional Chinese medicine GIS-2 (TCMGS-2) to obtain the most suitable areas of A. membranaceus var. mongholicus within Inner Mongolia. The results showed that the production areas of cultivated A. membranaceus var. mongholicus were mainly located in Wuchuan County, Guyang County and other 15 counties, which were cha-racterized by the altitude higher than 1000 m, with soil type of sand, gravel and calcareous clay. The wild A. membranaceus var. mongholicus was distributed mainly in the eastern Inner Mongolia and germinated in sunny place, which preferred to the cold dry climate and sandy loam soil or gra-vel but avoided damp heavy clay soils. There are 43 counties of 94460.30 km<sup>2</sup> for wild A. membranaceus var. mongholicus, and 32 counties of 76013.93 km<sup>2</sup> for cultivated one within Inner Mongolia, with a similarity coefficient of ecological factors greater than 95%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Deve-lopment, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Huhhot 010080, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "De Wang", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Deve-lopment, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Cai Mei", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Deve-lopment, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Qing Zhen", "Initials": "QZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Deve-lopment, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lin Fang", "Initials": "LF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Deve-lopment, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Cai Xiang", "Initials": "CX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Huhhot 010080, China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "\u5185\u8499\u53e4\u5730\u533a\u9053\u5730\u836f\u6750\u8499\u53e4\u9ec4\u82aa\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u67e5\u53ca\u4ea7\u5730\u9002\u5b9c\u6027."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9425159", "ISSNLinking": "1001-9332"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Astragalus propinquus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29726189", "10.13287/j.1001-9332.201603.035"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
