By 4-min microwave treatment of onion and cabbage juices as renewable, cheap, and green carbon sources and self-passivation agents, blue emissive S,N-CQDs have been synthesized (\u03bb<sub>ex</sub>/\u03bb<sub>em</sub> of 340/418\u00a0nm) with a fluorescence quantum yield of 15.2%. A full characterization of the natural biomass-derived quantum dots proved the self-doping with nitrogen and sulfur. The S,N-CQDs showed high efficiency as a fluorescence probe for sensitive determination of nitazoxanide (NTZ), that recently found wide applicability as a repurposed drug for COVID-19, over the concentration range of 0.25-50.0\u00a0\u03bcM with LOD of 0.07\u00a0\u03bcM. The nanoprobe has been successfully applied for NTZ determination in pharmaceutical samples with excellent % recovery of 98.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.42. Furthermore, the S,N-CQDs proved excellent performance as a sensitive fluorescence nanoprobe for determination of hemoglobin (Hb) over the concentration range of 36.3-907.5\u00a0nM with a minimum detectability of 10.30\u00a0nM. The probe has been applied for the determination of Hb in blood samples showing excellent agreement with the results documented by a medical laboratory. The greenness of the developed probe has been positively investigated by different greenness metrics and software. The green character of the proposed analytical methods originates from the synthesis of S,N-CQDs from sustainable, widely available, and cheap plants via low energy/low cost microwave-assisted technique. Omission of organic solvents and harsh chemicals beside dependence on mix-and-read analytical approach corroborate the method greenness. The obtained results demonstrated the substantial potential of the synthesized green, safe, cheap, and sustainable S,N-CQDs for pharmaceutical and biological applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
