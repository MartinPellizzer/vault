In September 2021, wild Asian copperleaf plants showed leaf yellowing in a corner outside a greenhouse (22\u00b050' N; 108\u00b017' E), Guangxi Province, China. Galls and egg masses were observed on the plant roots on approximately 60% of plants. Females and second-stage juveniles (J2) were dissected and extracted from roots with galls. The perineal pattern of females was dorsal-ventrally oval with low and round dorsal arches, lacking clear lateral lines. Morphological measurements of females (n=20; mean \u00b1 standard error) were body length (BL)\u2009697.7 \u00b1\u200917.3 \u03bcm, maximum body width (BW) 521.5\u2009\u00b1\u200918.3 \u03bcm, stylet length 14.8 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcm, and dorsal pharyngeal gland orifice to stylet base (DGO) 5.1 \u00b1 0.2\u03bcm. J2s (n = 20) were vermiform, had a slender tail, with a tapering to rounded tip with distinct hyaline region at the tail terminus and had the following morphological measurements: BL 475.5 \u00b1 32.7 \u03bcm, BW 16.7 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcm, stylet length 14.4 \u00b1 1.4 \u03bcm, DGO 3.9 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcm, hyaline tail length 18.0 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcm, and tail length 50.1 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcm. These morphological characteristics fit the description for Meloidogyne enterolobii (Yang and Eisenback 1983). In order to confirm species identification, genomic DNA was extracted from 12 single J2 (Luo et al. 2020). Species identity was further explored by the rDNA-internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region using primers V5367/26S (Vrain et al. 1992), and the D2-D3 fragment of the 28S ribosomal RNA gene using primers D2A/D3B (De Ley et al. 1999). The sequences for the target genes were 733 bp (GenBank accession no. OM168996) and 734 bp (GenBank accession no. OM177195), respectively. Homologies were 99 to 100% identical with those in GenBank for known sequences of M. enterolobii. Furthermore, species identification was confirmed using PCR to amplify a portion of the rDNA-IGS2 with M. enterolobii-specific primers Me-F/Me-R (Long et al. 2006). Koch's postulates was tested in a greenhouse at 25 to 28\u02daC temperature. Eggs were multiplied on tomato in the greenhouse using a single egg mass hand-picked from originally natural infected A. australis roots. Fifteen A. australis seedlings maintained in 14.5-cm diameter and 10-cm high pots containing autoclaved sandy soil (sand/soil = 3:1), one seedling/pot, inoculated with 5,000 eggs/plant, and five noninoculated seedlings were used as controls. After 60 days, all inoculated plants showed galling root symptoms and the control plants displayed no symptoms. The reproduction factor (Rutter et al. 2021) on A. australis was 4.3. Furthermore, the morphological and molecular characterization of the nematode was identical to the original samples. To our knowledge, this is the first report of M. enterolobii infecting Asian copperleaf that is cultivated in 29 provinces/regions of China. The growers should be aware of this nematode and take measures to avoid spread and serious economic losses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi University, 12664, Agricultural College Daxue Road 100, Nanning, Guangxi, China; JLMGXU@126.com."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Luming", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi University, 12664, Agricultural College Daxue Road 100, Nanning, Guangxi, China; wangy980518@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi University, 12664, Agricultural College Daxue Road 100, Nanning, Guangxi, China; 18854881887@163.com."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Fukun", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi University, 12664, Agricultural College Daxue Road 100, Nanning, Guangxi, China; cqsdau@163.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi University, 12664, Agricultural College Daxue Road 100, Nanning, Guangxi, China; yangshanshan12@126.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Shanshan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi University, 12664, Agricultural College, Daxue Road 100, Nanning, China, 530005; whyzxb@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "H Y", "Initials": "HY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["35815961", "10.1094/PDIS-05-22-1063-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
