This analog also showed synergy with a clinically used antimalarial drug artesunate and was able to curtail the IC<sub>50</sub> of artesunate up to 4-5 folds. Although, 4CE did not show any effect on heme polymerization, the most common drug target in the malaria parasite, it could increase the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) alone as well as in combination with artesunate. Further, 4CE induced oxidative stress was observed to affect the macromolecules in terms of DNA damage, protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation. At the physiological level, cellular organelles like mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum were observed to be get affected by 4CE in terms of membrane depolarization and calcium ion leakage respectively. These observations could be validated by expression analysis of oxidative stress responsive genes and proteins. Further, in in vivo assay, 4CE showed significant chemo-suppression of parasitemia as well as an increase in mean survival time in the murine malaria model. Interestingly, in combination with artesunate, 4CE showed higher chemo-suppression as well as enhanced mean survival time at a much lower concentrations of both the partners as compared to an individual dose of artesunate and 4CE. A combination of 4CE and artesunate was also observed to attenuate cerebral malaria pathogenesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..
