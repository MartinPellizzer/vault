An efficient continuous system for synchronous transformation and extraction of PSO from fig leaves applying microwave-assisted EDTA disodium (MAE-EDTA) was developed. The optimal MAE-EDTA condition was obtained: EDTA disodium concentration of 0.07\u2009mol\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, ethanol volume fraction of 56%, extraction time of 16\u2009min, and extraction temperature of 70\u2009\u00b0C by single factor experiments and response surface method (RSM). Under the optimal condition, the yield of PSO reached 27.24\u2009mg\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>. Compared with microwave-assisted ethanol extraction (MAE) and reflux extraction (RE), the yield of PSO by MAE-EDTA is 2.03-fold higher than RE and 1.70-fold higher than MAE. Therefore, MAE-EDTA is an efficient method for extracting PSO from fig leaves, and it might provide references for the extraction of PSO from other medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Forest Plant Ecology Ministry of Education, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, P.R.
