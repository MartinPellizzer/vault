In addition, compounds 2-4 are racemates. Their structures and absolute configurations were determined on the basis of extensive analysis of spectroscopic data and ECD calculation. All compounds were evaluated for the inhibitory effects on \u03b1-glucosidase, compounds 1, 5, and 7 showed moderate inhibitory activities with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 161.46, 257.78, and 11.54\u03bcg/ml, respectively.
