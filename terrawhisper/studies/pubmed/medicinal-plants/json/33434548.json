However, the production of Tartary buckwheat is very low and it is urgent to breed high-yield varieties for satisfying the increasing market demand. Heterotrimeric G-protein signaling involves in the regulation of agronomical traits and fruit development in several plant species. In this study, fifteen genes involved in G-protein signaling were characterized in Tartary buckwheat and their potential roles in fruit development were revealed by expression analysis. The exon-intron organization and conserved motif of Tartary buckwheat G-protein signaling genes were similar to those in other dicot plants. All these genes were ubiquitously and differently expressed in five tissues. The expression patterns of Tartary buckwheat G-protein signaling genes in fruit suggested they may play important roles in the fruit at early development stage, which was supported by meta-analysis of G-protein signaling genes' expression in the fruits from different species. Furthermore, we found the expression of G-protein signaling genes in fruit showed high correlation with 178 transcription factors, which indicated a transcriptional regulatory loop moderating G-protein signaling genes' expression during fruit development. This paper provides new insights into the physiological functions of G-protein signaling in fruit."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
