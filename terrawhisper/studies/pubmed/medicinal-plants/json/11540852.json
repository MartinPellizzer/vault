The ratios of cpm in receiver blocks on the bottom of primary roots : cpm in receiver blocks on the top of the primary roots were 1.87 and 2.47 after 1 and 2 hr, respectively. This polar transport of Ca across tips of primary roots correlated positively with a graviculture of 43 degrees after 2 hr. The ratio of cpm in receiver blocks on the bottom of lateral roots : cpm in receiver blocks on the top of lateral roots was 1.20 after 2 hr. The decreased polar movement of Ca across tips of lateral roots correlated positively with lateral roots being nongraviresponsive. These data 1) support the suggestion that gravistimulation induces polar movement Ca toward the lower side of tips of primary roots, and 2) suggest that the reduced polar movement of Ca across tips of lateral roots may be involved in uncoupling gravistimulation from gravicurvature in lateral roots."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Baylor University, Waco, Texas 76798, USA."}], "LastName": "Moore", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "0370467", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9122"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gravitropism"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Root Cap"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11540852"]}}]}
