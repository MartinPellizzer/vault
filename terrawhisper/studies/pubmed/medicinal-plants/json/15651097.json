Paeoniflorin was employed as internal standard and the sample pre-treatment procedure consists of deproteinization by addition of acetonitrile. Chromatographic separations were performed on a Shimadzu VP-ODS column (250 x 4.6 mm i.d., 5 microm). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile-0.1% acetic acid aqueous (v/v), 23:77, v/v, at a rate of 1 mL/min. Detection was carried out at a wavelength of 266 nm. Calibration standards ranged from 0.25 to 500 microg/mL in dog plasma and the mean correlation coefficient of 0.9981 was found for the linear calibration curves (n = 6). The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.25 microg/mL. Intra- and inter-assay RSD ranged from 0.70 to 7.5%. Accuracy (%bias) ranged from -6.3 to 6.0%. This method was applied to the pharmacokinetic study of picroside II in dogs. The study demonstrated the plasma picroside II concentration-time curves were fitted to the two-compartment open model and showed linear pharmacokinetics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants Development, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100094, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Fu-Chuan", "Initials": "FC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Shi-Lin", "Initials": "SL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Li-Zhen", "Initials": "LZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Validation Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cinnamates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoid Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "39012-20-9", "NameOfSubstance": "picroside II"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Freezing"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iridoid Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15651097", "10.1002/bmc.453"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
