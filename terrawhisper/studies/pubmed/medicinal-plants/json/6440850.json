This inhibitor, consisting of 41 amino-acid residues with three pairs of disulfide bonds was sequenced. Two active domains were found to be located at two disulfide loops composed of eight (Pos. 17-24) and nine (Pos. 29-37) amino-acid residues, respectively. It inhibits two molecules of trypsin simultaneously and might be regarded as the smallest double-headed trypsin inhibitor (Mr = 4575) so far known. The chemical modification of the inhibitor with cyclohexandione and citraconic anhydride showed that Arg20-Gly21 and Lys30-Leu31 corresponded to the two reactive sites, respectively. The discovery of the Trichosanthes inhibitor is of importance not only for the study on the structure-function relationship of proteinase inhibitor peptides but also for the search for low molecular mass inhibitors of clinical value among Chinese medical herbs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "F L", "Initials": "FL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "G D", "Initials": "GD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mu", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "N Q", "Initials": "NQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chi", "ForeName": "C W", "Initials": "CW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Hoppe Seylers Z Physiol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985060R", "ISSNLinking": "0018-4888"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "94ZLA3W45F", "NameOfSubstance": "Arginine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K3Z4F929H6", "NameOfSubstance": "Lysine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Arginine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lysine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6440850", "10.1515/bchm2.1984.365.2.1211"]}}]}
