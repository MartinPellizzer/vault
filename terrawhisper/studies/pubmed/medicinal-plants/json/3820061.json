The rapid fall, which followed immediately after injection of (6)-shogaol, disappeared with the use of atropine and vagotomy. The marked rise, which occurred after the rapid fall, was not affected by alpha-adrenoceptor blockades, Ca antagonists and ganglion blockade. However, a combination of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade and Ca antagonist inhibited this pressor response. In hindquarters perfused with a nutrient solution, (6)-shogaol (10(-5) g)-induced peripheral pressor response was also not affected by alpha-adrenoceptor blockades and Ca antagonists, but was inhibited by the combination of an alpha-adrenoceptor blockade and a Ca antagonist. Furthermore, this peripheral pressor response was eliminated by the removal of Ca ion from the perfusate. (6)-Shogaol did not exhibit a pressor response in an artery and a vein of the tail or an artery of the femur perfused with a nutrient solution. (6)-Shogaol-induced peripheral pressor response in hindquarters was markedly potentiated during the perfusion of norepinephrine (5 X 10(-6) g/ml), but this potentiation was prevented by pretreatment with reserpine (5 mg/kg, i.p.). Moreover, repeated injections of (6)-shogaol caused a tachyphylaxis in mesenteric and tail vascular beds and a slight tachyphylaxis in hindquarters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Suekawa", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aburada", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hosoya", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Pharmacobiodyn", "NlmUniqueID": "7901854", "ISSNLinking": "0386-846X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7C0697DR9I", "NameOfSubstance": "Atropine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "83DNB5FIRF", "NameOfSubstance": "shogaol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X4W3ENH1CV", "NameOfSubstance": "Norepinephrine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anesthesia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Atropine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Catechols"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood supply"], "DescriptorName": "Hindlimb"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Norepinephrine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Regional Blood Flow"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Splanchnic Circulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood supply"], "DescriptorName": "Tail"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3820061", "10.1248/bpb1978.9.842"]}}]}
