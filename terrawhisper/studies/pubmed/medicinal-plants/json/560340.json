Ointment of Shikon ether extract (50 mg/site) inhibited markedly an increased vascular permeability and acute edema induced by histamine, serotonin, bromelain, anti-rat rabbit serum and heat. It also inhibited an increase of local cutaneous temperature induced by phlogistic stimulation (ultraviolet irradiation and heat). On the other hand, it accelerated wound healing in rats. The activity of Shikon ether extract on inflammatory reaction was the most potent in 0.2 approximately 0.1% of ointment concentration and was diminished in higher or lower concentrations. Tooki extract inhibited slightly an acute inflammatory reaction, but had no effect on increase of cutaneous temperature and wound healing in rats. Shiunko contains about 0.2% of Shikon and 0.04% of Tooki extract. The effect of Shiunko was similar to that of Shikon ether extract, but the activity was slightly more potent than that of Shikon. Shiunko inhibited rubor, calor and tumor in acute inflammatory reaction and promoted wound healing. Furthermore, it was reported that pigments of Shikon have antibiotic activity. The results suggest that Shiunko is an effective ointment for cutaneous injuries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hayashi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0420550", "ISSNLinking": "0015-5691"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ointments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0F5N573A2Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Ether"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Topical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Capillary Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ether"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ointments"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["560340"]}}]}
