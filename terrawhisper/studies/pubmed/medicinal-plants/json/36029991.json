Diverse typical therapeutics, including VO<sub>2</sub>@ZIF67 nanoparticles, small molecule drugs salvianolic acid B (SaB)/ginsenoside (Rg1), probiotic Bacillus bifidus, and biomacromolecules SDF-1 were wrapped into 1.5\u00a0% GPS-0.5\u00a0% SA model microcapsules, respectively. Better mobility and formability were significantly observed, and showed 75\u00a0% survival rate of probiotics in simulated gastric juice and around 99\u00a0% encapsulation efficiency which is higher than single 2\u00a0% SA microcapsules. The microcapsules also obtained a delayed release and a higher cell index for SDF-1, which indicated better stability, biocompatibility and protective effect than single 2\u00a0% SA microcapsules. This study provides a strategy in developing plant derived polysaccharides as novel materials for the construction and improvement of traditional microcapsules."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
