Lac peak in the prophylactic group was elevated slightly (P<0.01, n=6), whereas in the treatment group the elevation of Lac was more remarkable than that in the prophylactic group (P<0.05, n=6). (2) In the ischemic group, the level of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) was decreased within 4 h after ischemia (P<0.05, n=6), and the decline persisted (P<0.01, n=6). In the treatment group and prophylactic group, NAA was decreased slightly after 24 h (P<0.05, n=6).
