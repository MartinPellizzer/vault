Review of the literature was done using databases including Magiran, Barakat Knowledge Network System, SID, RICST, IranDoc, PubMed/Medline, Science Direct, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and the Google Scholar search engine without time limit until December, 2018. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using Cochran's Q test and I<sup>2</sup> index. Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software version 2 according to a random-effects model. P-values less than 0.05 were considered as the significance level.", "The analysis consisted of 44 studies including 10,349 Iranian patients with DM. The prevalence of depression was estimated to be 61.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 56.6-66.7). The lowest and highest prevalence of depression based on regions was in the North (56.7% [95%CI: 44.9-67.8]) and the East (64.2% [95%CI: 30.7-87.9]), respectively. The depression prevalence in females and males was 63.9% (95%CI: 54.0-72.8) and 46.3% (95%CI: 36.4-56.4), respectively, The prevalence of mild, moderate, severe and highly severe depression was estimated to be 24.4% (95%CI: 21.0-28.2), 19.1% (95%CI: 15.2-23.9), 11.4% (95%CI: 8.6-14.9), and 4.6% (95%CI: 3.4-6.1), respectively. In eight studies, the prevalence of anxiety in Iranian patients with DM was estimated to be 64.5% (95%CI: 42.0-82.1).", "Depression and anxiety are more prevalent among Iranian patients with DM compared with developed countries.
