Little Delicata with an elicitor preparation of autoclaved and homogenized Pythium aphanidermatum culture resulted in rapid accumulation of indole alkaloids. Alkaloid formation was preceded by rapid transient increases in the extractable activities of the enzymes tryptophan decarboxylase and strictosidine synthase. The induction of these two enzyme activities occurred when cells were transferred to alkaloid production medium or treatment with fungal elicitors. Treatment of this cell line with translational or transcriptional inhibitors prevented the Pythium-induced increases of enzyme activity as well as alkaloid accumulation. When cells were transferred to alkaloid production medium the induction of strictosidine synthase activity preceded that of tryptophan decarboxylase by many hours even when cells were also treated with Pythium elicitor. Results suggested that tryptophan decarboxylase induction proceeds only when endogenous tryptamine levels were decreased by two-third. The internal cellular level of tryptamine, therefore, could regulate expression of tryptophan decarboxylase, whereas induction of strictosidine synthase or of another enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway could control channeling of tryptamine into alkaloids. The results demonstrate that fungal elicitors can be used to facilitate studies of the factors which regulate expression of indole alkaloid pathway enzymes and their ultimate pathway products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Eilert", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "De Luca", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Constabel", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kurz", "ForeName": "W G", "Initials": "WG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tryptamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "422ZU9N5TV", "NameOfSubstance": "tryptamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "98600C0908", "NameOfSubstance": "Cycloheximide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Transferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.28", "NameOfSubstance": "Aromatic-L-Amino-Acid Decarboxylases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.3.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon-Nitrogen Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.3.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "strictosidine synthetase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Aromatic-L-Amino-Acid Decarboxylases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon-Nitrogen Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cycloheximide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Induction"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Indoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pythium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Transferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tryptamines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3579315", "10.1016/0003-9861(87)90128-7", "0003-9861(87)90128-7"]}}]}
