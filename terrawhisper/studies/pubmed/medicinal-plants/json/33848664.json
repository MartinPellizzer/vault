For legal possession and use throughout the USA, hemp and hemp products must have delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration < 0.3%. As with most crops, pesticides may be applied when farming hemp, which need to be monitored in food, feed, and medicinal products. The aim of this work was to evaluate and validate the recently developed \"quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, safe, efficient, and robust\" (QuEChERSER) sample preparation mega-method to determine pesticide residues in hemp plants, flowers, powders, oils, and pellets. High-throughput analysis of final extracts for 106 targeted pesticides and metabolites from North American monitoring lists entailed: 1) ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) with column back-flushing, and 2) instrument-top sample preparation\u00a0+\u00a0low-pressure gas chromatography (ITSP+LPGC-MS/MS). In QuEChERSER, 2\u00a0g sample is extracted with 10\u00a0mL 4/1 (v/v) acetonitrile/water by mechanical shaking for 10\u00a0min, followed by 3\u00a0min centrifugation. For LC, 0.2\u00a0mL of extract is taken and solvent exchanged into initial mobile phase followed by 5\u00a0min ultra-centrifugation prior to the 10\u00a0min analysis. For GC-amenable pesticides, the remaining initial extract is partitioned with 4/1 (w/w) anh. MgSO<sub>4</sub>/NaCl, and 1\u00a0mL is taken for automated ITSP cleanup in parallel with 10\u00a0min LPGC analysis. In the former case, the UHPLC column is back-flushed with 1/1 (v/v) methanol/acetonitrile for 3\u00a0min between each injection to keep the system clean and avoid ghost peaks. Multi-level, multi-day validation results achieved 70-120% recoveries with RSDs < 20% for more than 80% of the analytes in hemp protein powder, oil, pellets, and fresh plant (dried hemp plant and flower were too complex). Limits of quantification (LOQs) were < 10\u00a0ng/g were achieved for nearly all pesticides, yielding 2.8% false negatives among >13,000 analyte results in the spiked samples. The QuEChERSER method was demonstrated to meet the challenge for several complex hemp matrices."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
