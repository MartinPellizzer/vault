Forty-eight crossbred steers were randomly allotted to replicated pastures consisting of fungus-infected (Neotyphodium coenophialum) fescue or fungus-free fescue each with or without ladino clover overseeding. At the end of the 180-d grazing period, serum was harvested from the steers. Steers were finished in a feedlot and slaughtered after approximately 150 d in the feedlot. Isoenzymes for LDH and G6PDH were separated using PAGE. Five LDH isoenzymes (L1-15) were typically detected. Isoenzyme L1 (most anodic) had the greatest area percent as detected by laser densitometry (72, 12, 10, 5, and 7%, respectively, for L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5). Four proteins had G6PDH activity (G1-G4) with G2 having the greatest area percent (15, 52, 27, and 14, respectively, for G1, G2, G3, and G4). Isoenzymes within a dehydrogenase were correlated (P < .05). In addition, area percentage of L1 was correlated (P < .05; r = .34) with area percentage of G2, and area percentage of L4 was correlated (P < .07; r = .73) with area percentage of G1. Area percentages of L1, L2, and L3 were affected by an interaction (P < .09) of forage types. Body weight gains for steers grazing endophyte-infected fescue were depressed (P < .05); however, steers compensated with increased (P < .05) weight gains during the finishing phase. Fungal toxins produced by Neotyphodium coenophialum may alter an animal's metabolism, growth, and development via shifts in reducing equivalents (NADH)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Sciences, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville 72701, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosenkrans", "ForeName": "C F", "Initials": "CF", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Coffey", "ForeName": "K P", "Initials": "KP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paria", "ForeName": "B C", "Initials": "BC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tarn", "ForeName": "C Y", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "Z B", "Initials": "ZB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moyer", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Vet Hum Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7704194", "ISSNLinking": "0145-6296"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.49", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "microbiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hypocreales"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11111938"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
