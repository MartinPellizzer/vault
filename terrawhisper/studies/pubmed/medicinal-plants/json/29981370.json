Dietary antioxidants, especially flavonoids, are being considered as a promising approach to prevent or slow the pathological development of neurological illness and aging. One of the major advantage of natural products is that of their anti-amyloid effects over synthetic counterpart, however a healthy diet provides these beneficial natural substances as nutraceuticals. The extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is one of the main pharmacological target of natural phenolic compounds, participating in several therapeutic effects. Mounting evidence revealed that numerous bioflavonoids, obtained from a variety of dietary fruits or plants as well as medicinal herbal sources, exhibit protective or therapeutic functions versus development of neurodegenerative diseases mainly through modulation of different compartments of ERK signaling pathway. Currently, there is remarkable interest in the beneficial effects of natural flavonoids to improve neural performance and prevent the onset and development of major neurodegenerative diseases. Natural products originated from medicinal plants, in particular antioxidants, have gained a great deal of attention due to their safe and non-toxic natures. Here, we summarized the effect of natural bioflavonoids on ERK signaling pathway and their molecular mechanism."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
