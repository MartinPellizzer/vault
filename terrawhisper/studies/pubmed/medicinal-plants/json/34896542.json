Obesity has been proven to be closely related to colorectal carcinogenesis. This review summarized the potential underlying mechanisms linking obesity to CRC in different aspects, including energy metabolism, inflammation, activities of adipokines and hormones. Furthermore, the potential therapeutic targets of obesity-associated CRC were predicted using network-based target analysis, with total predicted pathways not only containing previously reported pathways, but also putative signaling pathways pending for investigation. In addition, the current conventional therapeutic treatment options, plus the potential use of herbs and natural products in the management of obesity-associated CRC were also discussed. Taken together, the aim of this review article is to provide strong theoretical basis for future drug development, particularly herbs and natural products, in obesity-associated CRC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
