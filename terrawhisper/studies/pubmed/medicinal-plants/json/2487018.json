In its expression, this index takes into account the nutrient density (amount of nutrient/1,000 g of diet) and the nutrient density per reference volume. The last one is the ratio between the recommended allowances of the nutrient and the volume that it is possible to consume during the day, when the diet is offered freely. Zinc was used as example in the analysis. A total of 14 dishes of habitual consumption in Chile were studied in relation to its consumption by 30 preschool children. The volume that children were able to consume was determined by differential weighing between the amount offered and the amount left on the dish, during a period of 180 days. The percentage of water and energy value were established by means of chemical analysis performed according to the AOAC, and the zinc concentration by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The results of the INQV were then compared with those of the index of nutritional quality (INQ), which considers zinc density/1,000 kcal, and zinc and energy requirements. This comparison demonstrated that the INQV values were lower than those of the INQ in dishes with energy densities lower than 1.0 kcal/g. The opposite tendency was observed in the case of those dishes with energy densities higher than 1.0 kcal/g. The analysis herein presented demonstrates the usefulness of the INQV in diets which are voluminous and with low energy densities, commonly consumed by the low socioeconomic strata of developing countries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad de Chile, Santiago."}], "LastName": "Araya", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vera", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ruz", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pak", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Indice de calidad nutricional por volumen (ICNV): un nuevo indicador para evaluar la calidad nutricional de preparaciones y dietas."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "J41CSQ7QDS", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Intake"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Zinc"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2487018"]}}]}
