It often influences the patient's normal life. This study evaluated the therapeutic effects of the Chinese herb, Chi-Ju-Di-Huang-Wan, for treatment of dry eye patients. It is one of the most commonly prescribed Chinese herbs used for eyes, however, there are no scientific reports about its effect.", "This study included 80 dry eye patients. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group was treated with topical eye drops and Chi-Ju-Di-Huan-Wan. The control group was given topical eye drops and placebo. All patients received tear film examinations including Schirmer's test, Rose Bengal test, fluorescein stain test, break up time test and questionnaires.", "The results of the tear film tests were analysed by two independent t-tests between the two groups. No significant differences between the two groups according to the Schirmer's test were found. There was a significant difference in the Rose Bengal test at week 2 and tear break up time at week 4 (p = 0.04, 0.04, individually).", "Chi-Ju-Di-Huang-Wan is an effective stabilizer of tear film and decreases the abnormality of corneal epithelium.
