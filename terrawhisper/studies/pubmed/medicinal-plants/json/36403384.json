Although cachexia is characterized by skeletal muscle wasting and adipose tissue loss, it is a syndrome affecting different organs, which ultimately results in systemic complications and impaired quality of life. The pathogenesis and underlying molecular mechanisms of cachexia are not fully understood, and currently there are no effective standard treatments or approved drug therapies to completely reverse cachexia. Moreover, adequate nutritional interventions alone cannot significantly improve cachexia. Other approaches to ameliorate cachexia are urgently needed, and thus, the role of medicinal plants has received considerable importance in this respect due to their beneficial health properties. Increasing evidence indicates great potential of medicinal plants and their phytochemicals as an alternative and promising treatment strategy to reduce the symptoms of many diseases including cachexia. This article reviews the current status of cachexia, the molecular mechanisms of primary events driving cachexia, and state-of-the-art knowledge that reports the preventive and therapeutic activities of multiple families of phytochemical compounds and their pharmacological mode of action, which may hold promise as an alternative treatment modality for the management of cachexia. Based on our review of various in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo models of cachexia, we would conclude that phytochemicals may have therapeutic potential to attenuate cachexia, although clinical trials are required to unequivocally confirm this premise."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.
