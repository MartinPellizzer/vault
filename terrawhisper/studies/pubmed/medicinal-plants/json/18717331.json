RT-PCR assay and immunity histochemistry assay were used to determine the expression level of mdrl gene and P-gp in MCF-7/DOX cells to elucidate resistant character of MCF-7/DOX cells. The activity of isotetrandine to enhance doxorubicin cytotoxicity was tested using MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethyhthiazol)-2,5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and was evaluated by the reversal fold (RF) values. Intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin was assessed by the determination of doxorubicin-associated fluorescence intensity. Effect of isotetrandrine on the expression level of P-gp in MCF-7/DOX cells was then determined by immunity histochemistry assay. The ability of isotetrandrine to inhibit P-gp function was evaluated by detecting the accumulation and efflux of rhodamine 123 (Rh123) with flow cytometry (FCM). Verapamil was employed as a comparative agent in whole experiment. The results indicated that MCF-7/DOX cells had phenotype of MDR and that the positive expression of P-gp was their resistant character. 10 microg x mL(-1) isotetrandrine could distinctly enhance cytotoxicity of DOX in MCF-7/DOX cells and reversal fold (RF) was significantly higher than that of verapamil (P < 0.05), but it hardly affected cytotoxicity of DOX in MCF-7 cells and the expression level of P-gp in MCF-7/DOX cells. The ability of isotetrandrine to inhibit P-gp function was reversible, because incubation of MCF-7/DOX cells with isotetrandrine caused a marked increase in uptake and a notable decrease in efflux of Rh123 and a marked increase of intracellular DOX concentrations. In conclusion, isotetrandrine exhibited potent effect on the reversal of P-gp-mediated MDR in vitro, suggesting that it might become a candidate of effective MDR reversing agent in cancer chemotherapy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacy, Henan University, Kaifeng 475004, China. wtx1975@henu.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Tian-Xiao", "Initials": "TX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hong", "Initials": "XH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzylisoquinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1N3CZ14C5O", "NameOfSubstance": "Rhodamine 123"}, {"RegistryNumber": "29EX23D5AJ", "NameOfSubstance": "tetrandrine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "80168379AG", "NameOfSubstance": "Doxorubicin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzylisoquinolines"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Doxorubicin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Multiple"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, MDR"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mahonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rhodamine 123"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18717331"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
