They have been intensively studied in model systems and crops for approximately two decades and massive amount of information have been obtained. However, for medicinal plants, ncRNAs, particularly their regulatory roles in bioactive compound biosynthesis, are just emerging as a hot research field.", "This review aims to summarize current knowledge on herbal ncRNAs and their regulatory roles in bioactive compound production.", "So far, scientists have identified thousands of miRNA candidates from over 50 medicinal plant species and 11794 lncRNAs from Salvia miltiorrhiza, Panax ginseng, and Digitalis purpurea. Among them, more than 30 miRNAs and five lncRNAs have been predicted to regulate bioactive compound production.", "The regulation may achieve through various regulatory modules and pathways, such as the miR397-LAC module, the miR12112-PPO module, the miR156-SPL module, the miR828-MYB module, the miR858-MYB module, and other siRNA and lncRNA regulatory pathways.
