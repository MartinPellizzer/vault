Severe toxicity was indicated by a decreased K+, adenosine triphosphate and glutathione (GSH) content of the slices, increased release of alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase into the medium, and increased formation of thiobarbituric acid reacting substances. Pretreatment of animals for 7 days with aged garlic extract (AGE) (Kyolic) at doses of 2 and 10 ml/kg/day dramatically reduced the toxicity of BB in a dose-dependent manner. The GSH content of liver slices from rats treated with AGE at 2 or 10 ml/kg/day increased by 50 and 80%, respectively. The BB-induced decrease in GSH content was less in slices derived from AGE-treated rats compared with slices from control rats. Pretreatment with AGE did not affect cytochrome P450 when assayed as 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase and 7-pentoxyresorufin O-depentylase activities in hepatic microsomes. Thus, the mechanism by which pretreatment with AGE protects against BB hepatotoxicity involves both an elevation of hepatic GSH content, and a GSH sparing effect, possibly due to conjugation of organosulphur compounds in AGE with toxic BB metabolites. Only this GSH sparing effect was seen in our earlier study on the in vitro hepatoprotective effect of AGE [Wang et al., 1998.
