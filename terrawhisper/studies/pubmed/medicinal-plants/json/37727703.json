It plays an important physiological role in the growth of flower buds. However, the hyperoside biosynthesis pathway has not been systematically elucidated in plants, including its original source, Hypericaceae. Our group found abundant hyperoside in the flower buds of <i>Hypericum monogynum</i>, and we sequenced its transcriptome to study the biosynthetic mechanism of hyperoside. After gene screening and functional verification, four kinds of key enzymes were identified. Specifically, HmF3Hs (flavanone 3-hydroxylases) and HmFLSs (flavonol synthases) could catalyze flavanones into dihydroflavonols, as well as catalyzing dihydroflavonols into flavonols. HmFLSs could also convert flavanones into flavonols and flavones with varying efficiencies. HmF3'H (flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase) was found to act broadly on 4'-hydroxyl flavonoids to produce 3',4'-diydroxylated flavanones, dihydroflavonols, flavonols, and flavones. HmGAT (flavonoid 3-<i>O</i>-galactosyltransferase) would transform flavonols into the corresponding 3-<i>O</i>-galactosides, including hyperoside. The parallel hyperoside biosynthesis routes were thus depicted, one of which was successfully reconstructed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> BL21(DE3) by feeding naringenin, resulting in a hyperoside yield of 25\u00a0mg/l. Overall, this research not only helped us understand the interior catalytic mechanism of hyperoside in <i>H. monogynum</i> concerning flower development and bioactivity, but also provided valuable insights into these enzyme families."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.
