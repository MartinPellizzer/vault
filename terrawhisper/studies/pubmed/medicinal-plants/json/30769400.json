Bip.) is an economically important medicinal herb increasingly grown in China in recent years. In June of 2005, a leaf spot disease on commercially grown plants was found in the QiTai Region, south of the Tianshan Mountain area of Xinjiang, China at 2,100 m above sea level. Disease incidence was approximately 60 to 70% of the plants during the 2006 and 2007 growing seasons. Initial symptoms appeared on older leaves as irregularly shaped, minute, dark brown-to-black spots, with yellow borders on the edge of the leaflet blade by July. As the disease progressed, the lesions expanded, causing the leaflets to turn brown, shrivel, and die. A fungus was consistently isolated from the margins of these lesions on potato dextrose agar. Fifty-eight isolates were obtained that produced abundant conidia in the dark. Conidia were usually solitary, rarely in chains of two, ellipsoid to obclavate, with 6 to 11 transverse and one longitudinal or oblique septum. Conidia measured 60 to 80 \u00d7 20 to 30 \u03bcm, including a filamentous beak (13 to 47 \u00d7 3.5 to 6 \u03bcm). According to the morphology, and when compared with the standard reference strains, the causal organism of leaf spot of snow lotus was identified as Alternaria carthami (1,4). Pathogenicity of the strains was tested on snow lotus seedlings at the six-leaf stage. The lower leaves of 20 plants were sprayed until runoff with conidial suspensions of 1 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> spores mL<sup>-1</sup>, and five plants sprayed with sterile distilled water served as controls. All plants were covered with a polyethylene bag, incubated at 25\u00b0C for 2 days, and subsequently transferred to a growth chamber at 25\u00b0C with a 16-h photoperiod. Light brown lesions developed within 10 days on leaflet margins in all inoculated plants. The pathogen was reisolated from inoculated leaves, and isolates were deposited at the Key Oasis Eco-agriculture Laboratory of Xinjiang Production and Construction Group, Xinjiang and the Institute of Biotechnology, Zhejiang University. No reports of a spot disease caused by A. carthami on snow lotus leaves have been found, although this pathogen has been reported on safflower in western Canada (3), Australia (2), India (1), and China (4). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a leaf spot caused by A. carthami on snow lotus in China. References: (1) S. Chowdhury. J. Indian Bot. Soc. 23:59, 1944. (2) J. A. G. Irwin. Aust. J.
