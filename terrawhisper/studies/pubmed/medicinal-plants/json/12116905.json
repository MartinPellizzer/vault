Their hazardous and threatening effects may be not only direct but also indirect affecting microorganisms, animals and plants. This aspect of hazard and risk assessment is almost identical to that of toxicity. There are various categories of chemicals and for each of them risk assessment regulations have been developed. There are two major groups of chemicals: those which are already known and new ones. There are also some specific categories of chemical compounds, such as pesticides, biocides, medicinal products, cosmetics, food additives, feed additives, as well as radioactive substances and others. At present, the binding national and international regulations regarding different categories of chemical compounds are the subject of discussion in the member states of the European Union. In Poland, and attempt has been made to find appropriate examples of legal regulations that could be followed in our country, and this problem remains still open."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Katedry i Zak\u0142adu Toksykologii Akademii Medycznej w Lublinie. kasia.pietryka@poczta.wp.pl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dawidek-Pietryka", "ForeName": "Katarzyna", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dudka", "ForeName": "Jaros\u0142aw", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"], "VernacularTitle": "Ocena ryzyka w odniesieniu do istniejacych i nowych zwiazk\u00f3w chemicznych."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Med Pr", "NlmUniqueID": "0376642", "ISSNLinking": "0465-5893"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hazardous Substances"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hazardous Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}], "NumberOfReferences": "34"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12116905"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
