In this study, we aimed to produce sustained-release buprenorphine (BP) using lipid-liquid crystal gels.", "The three experimental groups in this study included: group I: lipid-liquid crystal formulation 5 (F5) containing BP, group II: BP-free F5, group III: BP solution in NMP, and group IV: control (no treatment). The formulations were injected subcutaneously into the rabbits' back neck.", "The results showed that the time required to reach the drug's maximum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) was longer in group I than in group III. The maximum BP concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and the constants of the drug removal rate and drug absorption rate (K<sub>a</sub>) were significantly higher in group III compared to group I. The half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of the drug in blood circulation was significantly longer in group I than in group III. Histopathological analysis revealed no histological abnormalities in the skin and heart in group I (BP-containing F5); however, mild hyperemia was observed in interstitial vessels in group III (BP-containing NMP). The kidney and liver tissues showed normal structure in the control group, as well as groups I and II. However, in the group receiving BP-containing NMP, significant congestion, tissue damage, necrosis, and fibrosis were observed in the kidney and liver.", "The results showed that the lipid-liquid crystal system can be used to design slow-release platforms for BP, minimizing the side effects associated with the use of its conventional forms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
