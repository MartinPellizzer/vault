The plates were divided into treatment (cells with RBC), control (cells only), and blank (media only) groups. In the treatment groups, two types of nanohybrid flowable RBCs were used: Bis-GMA-free and Bis-GMA groups. Each treatment group was subdivided according to the curing method, i.e., direct curing (RBC was injected into the wells and cured directly on the attached cells) and indirect curing (the samples were pre-cured outside of the well plate and then added to the well plate with cells). To vary the LCU, the subgroups were further divided into three groups: multiple-emission peak light-emitting diode, single-emission peak light-emitting diode, and quartz-tungsten-halogen units. Curing was conducted for 20\u00a0seconds. The hGFc cytotoxicity was evaluated via 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay after 24, 48, and 72 hours of culturing.", "The MTT assay results showed that both RBCs were significantly cytotoxic toward hGFc compared to the control group (p < 0.0001). The Bis-GMA group was significantly more cytotoxic to the cells compared to the Bis-GMA-free group. In addition, the curing method and time interval affected cell viability regardless of the LCU used.", "The Bis-GMA flowable RBC and direct curing method had the highest cytotoxic effects on hGFc regardless of the LCU used. Careful selection of flowable RBCs and proper curing techniques are required to decrease the cytotoxic effects on hGFc and improve the clinical handling of oral tissues."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 by the American College of Prosthodontists."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6553-9881"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oral and Maxillofacial Prosthodontics Department, Faculty of Dentistry, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Bukhary", "ForeName": "Dalea M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0413-8387"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Restorative Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Al-Zain", "ForeName": "Afnan O", "Initials": "AO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oral and Maxillofacial Prosthodontics Department, Faculty of Dentistry, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alshali", "ForeName": "Ruwaida Z", "Initials": "RZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Bukhary", "ForeName": "Deena M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medicinal and Aromatic plants research institute, National center for research, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Abdalla", "ForeName": "Ashraf N", "Initials": "AN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Basic Medical Science, Department of Basic and Clinical Oral Sciences, Faculty of Dentistry, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Suez Canal University, Ismailia, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Youssef", "ForeName": "Abdel-Rahman", "Initials": "AR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Prosthodont", "NlmUniqueID": "9301275", "ISSNLinking": "1059-941X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dental Materials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Composite Resins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "454I75YXY0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Curing Lights, Dental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light-Curing of Dental Adhesives"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Composite Resins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materials Testing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Luchinskaya D, Du R, Bittner N.
