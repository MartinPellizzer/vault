Birds were supplemented with <i>M. oleifera</i> leaf extract (MLE) and seed extract (MSE) for 35 days. Group I was the control (fed merely basal diets), while Group II received 0.8% MLE, Group III was given 0.8% MSE, Group IV was given 1.2% MLE, Group V was given 1.2% MSE, Group VI was given 0.8% MLE + 0.8% MSE, and Group VII was given 1.2% MLE + 1.2% MSE. At the end of the fifth week, two chickens were selected from each replica, and samples (small intestine and ileal ingesta) were collected.", "The chicken diet with MLE and MSE supplements saw significant improvement (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in both feed conversion ratio (FCR) and body weight gain (BWG). In the small intestine (duodenal, jejunal, and ileal), dietary MLE and MSE supplements significantly increased (<i>p</i> < 0.05) the surface area of the villus and the ratio of their height/crypt depth in comparison to the control group. The MLE and MSE supplements significantly increased (<i>p</i> < 0.05) the total goblet cell counts in the small intestine.
