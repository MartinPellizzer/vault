Data were generated from denervated isoperfused small intestinal preparations. Arterial pressure, venous pressure, and oxygen consumption were continuously monitored. Determinations of intestinal blood flow allowed calculation of mesenteric vascular resistance and oxygen consumption. Animals underwent stepwise reductions in arterial pressure and acute venous hypertension (10 to 15 mm Hg). There were no differences in baseline hemodynamic or metabolic parameters in control (C) or digitalized (D) animals. Blood flow and oxygen consumption were autoregulated in both C and D rats until perfusion pressure decreased below 50 mm Hg. The response to acute venous hypertension was different. In D rats, venous hypertension resulted in increased vascular resistance (millimeters of mercury per milliliter per minute per 100 gm) [0.89 +/- 0.05 to 0.97 +/- 0.07; p less than 0.05], whereas C rats demonstrated no change [0.92 +/- 0.08 to 0.95 +/- 0.09]. The decrease in oxygen consumption in D rats (-14%) was slightly but significantly greater than that observed in C rats (-9%). Digitalized rats demonstrated a heightened myogenic response to acute venous hypertension with deleterious effects on vascular resistance and oxygen consumption. This reaction was intrinsic to the mesenteric circulation and not mediated by sympathetic nerves or central reflexes. Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia in digitalized patients may reflect a similar abnormal response to the acute increases in portal pressure accompanying cardiac failure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "E H", "Initials": "EH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gewertz", "ForeName": "B L", "Initials": "BL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Vasc Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "8407742", "ISSNLinking": "0741-5214"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "73K4184T59", "NameOfSubstance": "Digoxin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Digoxin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Homeostasis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood supply"], "DescriptorName": "Intestine, Small"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mesenteric Arteries"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mesenteric Veins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Splanchnic Circulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Resistance"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3820409", "10.1067/mva.1987.avs0050382", "0741-5214(87)90149-2"]}}]}
