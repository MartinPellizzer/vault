Globally, interest in use of herbal medicine has increased; as drawbacks of modern medicine and have started getting more prominent. Most of the traditional system of medicine; all in their formulations depends on plants. Traditional herbal cough products have considered to be mild, nontoxic, non-sedative and even harmless. As Syrup is commonly taken for the relief of cough; we aimed to formulate a cough syrup (Graphirine) from some common indigenous herbs; Adhatoda vasica, Piper longum and Rosa Damasena and evaluate its physicochemical parameters along with the changes in accelerated stability testing. Preformulation studies, i.e. moisture content, ash, water and ethanol extractive values of all three herbs were defined. Physicochemical factors, quantitative spectral measurement, FTIR spectrum for identification of compounds; along with accelerated stability and possible microbial fungal growth; were also checked for the formulated syrup. Each and every parameter complied with the specifications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shehzad", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan /Research Department, Hamdard University, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rizwani", "ForeName": "Ghazala H", "Initials": "GH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jinnah Sindh Medical University, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ishaq", "ForeName": "Sumira", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Yaqoob", "ForeName": "Muhammad Arshad", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jinnah Sindh Medical University, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shareef", "ForeName": "Huma", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antitussive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antitussive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Compounding"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Justicia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Piper"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rosa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32122864"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
