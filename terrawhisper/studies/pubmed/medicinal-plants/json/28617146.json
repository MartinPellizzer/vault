One handful of Tako-Na bark was boiled in water to make tea. He had vomiting and watery diarrhea six hours after drinking it. He took no medications and had no history of hypertension. The only remarkable vital sign was BP 167/90\u2009mmHg. Physical examination revealed generalized muscle weakness. Laboratory findings were potassium 2.7\u2009mmol/L, bicarbonate 24\u2009mmol/L, and transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) 5.6. He was discharged the next day with a BP 140/90\u2009mmHg and potassium 4.2\u2009mmol/L. Case 2: A 78-year-old man, a friend of case 1, also drank Tako-Na tea from the same pot at the same time as case 1. He also had vomiting and diarrhea six hours later. He took no medications despite past history of hypertension (baseline SBP 140-160). Initial BP was 230/70\u2009mmHg. He also had muscle weakness. Laboratory findings were potassium 3.3\u2009mmol/L, bicarbonate 24\u2009mmol/L, TTKG 7.37 and normal thyroid function. He was also discharged the next day with a BP 148/70\u2009mmHg and potassium 4.2\u2009mmol/L. Case 3-7: These were patients reported to a poison center and their potassium concentrations were 1.4, 1.4, 3.3, 1.3 and 1.2\u2009mmol/L, respectively. Three of them were intubated and case 3 died.", "Tako-Na contains betulin, betulinic acid, taraxerone, lupeol, and lupenone. Their structures are similar to glycyrrhetic acid, the active metabolite of glycyrrhizic acid found in licorice which is well known to cause pseudoaldosteronism. Glycyrrhetic acid is potent in inhibiting 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and causes pseudoaldosteronism. We hypothesize that the compounds in Tako-Na act in the same way as glycyrrhetic acid in producing pseudoaldosteronism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Emergency Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Vajira Hospital , Navamindradhiraj University , Bangkok , Thailand."}], "LastName": "Othong", "ForeName": "Rittirak", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Emergency Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital , Mahidol University , Bangkok , Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Ramathibodi Poison Center, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital , Mahidol University , Bangkok , Thailand."}], "LastName": "Trakulsrichai", "ForeName": "Satariya", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Ramathibodi Poison Center, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital , Mahidol University , Bangkok , Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital , Mahidol University , Bangkok , Thailand."}], "LastName": "Wananukul", "ForeName": "Winai", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Clin Toxicol (Phila)", "NlmUniqueID": "101241654", "ISSNLinking": "1556-3650"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RWP5GA015D", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Diospyros"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrocardiography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "diagnosis", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypokalemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Liddle Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Strength"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "diagnosis", "physiopathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Weakness"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Skeletal"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Ventricular Premature Complexes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28617146", "10.1080/15563650.2017.1330957"]}}]}
