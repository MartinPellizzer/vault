Several cases of fatal overdose deaths in the clinical use of MTX, along with the presence of ischemic hepatitis in deceased patients, have been documented. The present study aimed to investigate the metabolic activation of MTX and to define the possible correlation between the metabolic activation and cytotoxicity of MTX. An oxidative metabolite (M1) and a GSH conjugate (M2) were observed in S9 fraction incubations as well as in rat primary hepatocyte culture after exposure to MTX. M1 and M2 were also observed in bile of MTX-treated rats. CYP2A6 was found to dominate the oxidation of MTX. Both methoxsalen (MTS, a CYP2A6 inhibitor) and 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol (DCNP, a sulfotransferase inhibitor) dramatically decreased the formation of M2. Pre-treatment of primary hepatocytes with DCNP or MTS significantly decreased the susceptibility to the cytotoxicity of MTX."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
