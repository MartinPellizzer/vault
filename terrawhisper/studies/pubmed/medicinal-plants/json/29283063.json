However, platelet up-regulation leads to the development and the complications of several cardiovascular diseases. For the effective management of these complications, several synthetic drugs are in clinical practice such as aspirin, warfarin and other drugs. since a long time. But some adverse reactions like aspirin resistance and bleed disorders cause patient incompliance and reduce their therapeutic potential. Thus, the search for potent and safer antiplatelet agents is of great interest.", "Various search engines such as Google, GoogleScholar, PubMed and ScienceDirect were used for the search of antiplatelet glycosides. All peered review journals were considered in the review.", "Glycoside is a class of naturally-occurring organic compounds that are frequently found in the plant kingdom. Similarly, platelet aggregation beyond the purpose of hemostasis is the underlying cause of blood clottingrelated diseases. The results showed strong potential of plant derived glycosides in various preclinical studies.", "This review presents a thorough understanding of plant-derived glycosides as antiplatelet agents with a possible mechanism of action based on the existing literature. In addition, this review discusses the possibility of formulating antiplatelet medications from plant glycosides with strong safety profile.
