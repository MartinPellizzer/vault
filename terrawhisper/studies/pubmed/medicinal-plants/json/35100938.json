Topiramate (TMP) is an effective popular migraine prophylaxis that is accepted for utilize in adults and teenagers. Therefore, the target of this research is to estimate the potential toxic effects of TMP on liver and kidney in male mice. Thirty-two adult albino male mice were divided into four groups (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20098 mice). Group I of animals was given saline solution and used as negative control. The other three groups were administrated TPM at doses (100, 200 and 400\u2009mg/kg) for 28\u2009days. Genotoxicity was evaluated by comet assay and DNA fragmentation by Diphenyleamine. Biochemical investigation was achieved by estimating liver enzymes (AST, ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) creatinine and uric acid. In addition, measurement of the antioxidant enzymes, malondialdehyde and nitric oxide were performed in both two tissues of liver and kidney. Microscopic examination of hematoxyline and eosin (H&E), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1) and caspase3 stained sections were done to explore the effect of topiramate on mice tissues of liver and kidney. The data revealed that TPM showed dose dependent toxicity that represented in: DNA damage in tested cells and increased level of liver enzymes, creatinine and uric acid as markers of toxicity. Topiramate significantly diminished antioxidant enzymes activities and elevated the level of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide. In addition, TPM caused histopathological alterations and dose dependent positive immune reaction for TNF--\u03b1 and caspase 3 in kidney and liver tissues. The results showed that Topiramate has marked toxicity in liver and kidney of mice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8335-5381"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cell Biology Department, National Research Center, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "El Makawy", "ForeName": "Aida I", "Initials": "AI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cell Biology Department, National Research Center, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mabrouk", "ForeName": "Dalia M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research Department, National Research Centre, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ibrahim", "ForeName": "Faten M", "Initials": "FM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pathology Department, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Kawkab A", "Initials": "KA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0H73WJJ391", "NameOfSubstance": "Topiramate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Topiramate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35100938", "10.1080/01480545.2019.1660364"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
