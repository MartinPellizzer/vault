Thus, the objective of the present study was to investigate the possible ameliorative effect of Fenofibrate (Fen), Diosmetin (D), and their combination against cis-mediated testicular damage. Fifty-four adult male albino rats were randomly allocated into nine groups (6 rats each): Control group, Fen (100\u00a0mg/kg), D20 (20\u00a0mg/kg), D40 (40\u00a0mg/kg), Cis group (7\u00a0mg/kg), Cis +Fen group (7\u00a0mg/kg+100\u00a0mg/kg), Cis+D20 group (7\u00a0mg/kg+20\u00a0mg/kg), Cis+D40 group (7\u00a0mg/kg+40\u00a0mg/kg), Cis+Fen+D40 treated group (7\u00a0mg/kg+100\u00a0mg/kg+40\u00a0mg/kg). Relative testicular weight, epididymal sperm count and viability, serum testosterone level, testicular oxidative stress indices, mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-\u03b1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), histopathological, and immunohistochemical alterations were assessed. Our results revealed that cis administration induced testicular oxidative and inflammatory damage as indicated by a substantial reduction in relative testicular weight, sperm parameters, serum testosterone levels, the antioxidant enzyme activity of catalase, and Johnson's histopathological score, PPAR-\u03b1/NRF-2/HO-1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunoexpression with marked increment in malondialdehyde (MDA), Cosentino's score, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03ba\u03b2 p65), interleukin (IL)-\u00a01\u03b2 and caspase 3 in testicular tissue. Interestingly, Fen and D diminished the harmful effects of cis on testes via upregulation of the antioxidant activities and downregulation of lipid peroxidation, apoptosis, and inflammation. Moreover, the combination therapy Fen/D40 also exhibited a more pronounced enhancement of previous markers than either treatment alone. In conclusion, because of their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties, cotreatment with Fen or D or their combination could be beneficial in reducing the harmful impacts of cis on testicular tissue, particularly in patients that receive cis chemotherapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
