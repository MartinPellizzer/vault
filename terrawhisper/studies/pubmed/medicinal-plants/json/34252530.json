Various herbal remedies have been claimed to be effective for the treatment of dyslipidemia in traditional and folkloric medicine of different regions clinical trials have been conducted to investigate their efficacy. The aim of the current systematic review is to critically assess the meta-analyses of controlled trials (CT) evaluated herb medicines for dyslipidemia.", "Relevant studies from Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist until January 2021 have been searched. All meta-analyses which pooled studies on the effect of herbal medicines on lipid profile including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low- or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C) were also included. Meta-analyses of in vitro, animal or observational studies were excluded.", "The overall of 141 meta-analyses were revealed. Vegetable oils, phytosterols, tea, soy protein, nuts, and curcumin have been studied frequently among the herbal medicines. Among 13 meta-analyses on vegetable oils, the greater reduce of TC (18.95\u00a0mg/dl), LDL-C (16.24\u00a0mg/dl) and TG (13.69\u00a0mg/dl) were exhibited from sunflower oil. Furthermore, rice bran oil (6.65\u00a0mg/dl) increased HDL-C significantly. Phytosterols in 12 meta-analyses demonstrated significant improvements in reducing TC, LDL-C and TG as 16.4, 23.7, and 8.85\u00a0mg/dl, respectively, and rise in HDL-C as 10.6\u00a0mg/dl. The highest reduction in serum level of TC, LDL-C and TG was reported while intake Green tea; 27.57, 24.75, and 31.87\u00a0mg/dl, accordingly within 9 meta-analyses. Average improvement of lipid profiles by 6 meta-analyses on plant proteins were 23.2, 21.7, 15.06, and 1.55\u00a0mg/dl for TC, LDL-C, TG, and HDL-C, respectively. Among 11 meta-analyses on nuts, almond showed better and significant alleviations in TC (10.69\u00a0mg/dl), walnut in LDL-C (9.23\u00a0mg/dl), pistachio in TG (22.14\u00a0mg/dl), and peanut in HDL-C (2.72\u00a0mg/dl). Overall, Curcumin, Curcuminoid, and Turmeric have resulted in the reduction of TC (25.13\u00a0mg/dl), LDL-C (39.83\u00a0mg/dl), TG (33.65\u00a0mg/dl), and an increase in the HDL-C (4.31\u00a0mg/dl).", "The current systematic review shed light on the use of herbal medicines for the management of dyslipidemia.
