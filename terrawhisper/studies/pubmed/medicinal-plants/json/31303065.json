The studies about randomized controlled trials in cancer treatment with EGFR-TKIs were retrieved and the systematic evaluation was conducted. The results suggest that EGFR-TKIs significantly increase the risk of skin toxicities including all-grade rash, pruritus, dry skin, and high-grade rash, pruritus. However, the risk of high-grade dry skin did not increase. Rash was the most common toxicity. Physicians should be aware of skin toxicities and should monitor cancer patients when receiving EGFR-TKIs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, Sichuan Industrial Institute of Antibiotics, Chengdu University , Chengdu , China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Wenxia", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b College of Pharmacy, Southwest Minzu University , Chengdu , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Invest", "NlmUniqueID": "8307154", "ISSNLinking": "0735-7907"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Kinase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.10.1", "NameOfSubstance": "ErbB Receptors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "ErbB Receptors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Exanthema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Kinase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31303065", "10.1080/07357907.2019.1634089"]}}]}
