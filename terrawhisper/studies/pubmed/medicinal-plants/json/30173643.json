Pharmacotherapies are now being introduced because lifestyle modifications alone are insufficient for weight management. The treatment outcomes of current approved anti-obesity agents are not satisfying due to drug-related intolerances. And so natural therapies including herbal medicines are popular alternatives for weight reduction; however, there are limited studies about their mechanism of actions.", "Five databases (PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Proquest) were searched to investigate the targets and safety profiles of the current and past anti-obesity drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as well as the commonly used off-label agents. The targets for weight-loss natural products and their principle bioactive components have also been searched. Only articles in English were included.", "The targets for current anti-obesity single agents include pancreatic lipase, Glucagon Like Peptide-1(GLP-1) receptor, and serotonin 2C (5-HT2C) receptor. Potential targets such as amylin, pancreatic alpha amylase, leptin receptor, melanocortin receptor 4 receptor (MC4R), Peroxisome Proliferator- Activated Receptors gamma (PPAR \u03b3), endocannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptor and Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP)-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) were discussed in various studies. Natural compounds have been found to interact with targets like pancreatic lipase, pancreatic alpha amylase, AMPK and PPAR \u03b3 to achieve weight reduction.", "Current pharmacotherapies and natural chemical compounds do act on same targets. Further investigations on the interactions between herbal compounds and the above targets are essential for the development of novel weight-loss therapies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, RMIT University, Bundoora West Campus, Victoria 3083, Australia."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Shiqi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, RMIT University, Bundoora West Campus, Victoria 3083, Australia."}], "LastName": "Lenon", "ForeName": "George Binh", "Initials": "GB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Sciences, RMIT University, Bundoora West Campus, Victoria 3083, Australia."}], "LastName": "Gill", "ForeName": "Harsharn", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, RMIT University, Bundoora West Campus, Victoria 3083, Australia."}], "LastName": "Yuen", "ForeName": "Heidi", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, RMIT University, Bundoora West Campus, Victoria 3083, Australia."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Angela Wei Hong", "Initials": "AWH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Sciences, RMIT University, Bundoora West Campus, Victoria 3083, Australia."}], "LastName": "Hung", "ForeName": "Andrew", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology, Vietnam Military Medical University, Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Nguyen", "ForeName": "Linh Toan", "Initials": "LT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "100960531", "ISSNLinking": "1389-4501"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Obesity Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "PPAR gamma"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "PPARG protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.31", "NameOfSubstance": "AMP-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.3", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.3", "NameOfSubstance": "PNLIP protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Pancreatic alpha-Amylases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "AMP-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Obesity Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Regulatory Networks"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "PPAR gamma"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pancreatic alpha-Amylases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30173643", "10.2174/1389450119666180830125958", "CDT-EPUB-92703"]}}]}
