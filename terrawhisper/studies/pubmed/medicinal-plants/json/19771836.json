The test of age of plant materials found that high survival rate could be obtained from semi-lignified stem segments and the segments from the base stem could survive successfully.

Moreover, the rooting rate reached 89.4% by inserting segments with leaves into sand soil after dipping into 1500 mg/L IBA for 10 s, and with plastic membrane and shading net covered.", "The rooting rate can increase significantly by collecting semi-lignified basal stems in autumn, cutting them for leaf cuttings, and inserting them into sand soil after dipping into 1500 mg/L IBA for 10 s."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Environmental Science and Biodiversity Conservation of Sichuan Higher Education, College of Life Science, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yun-Xiang", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Yong-Mei", "Initials": "YM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Araliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19771836"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
