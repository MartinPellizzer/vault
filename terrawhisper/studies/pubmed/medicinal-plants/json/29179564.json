Pazij has been used as traditional herb and food due to its wide biological properties. Seventeen known compounds were isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction. Their structures were identified by spectroscopic data and comparison with published data. Among them, 14 ones were identified from H. seravshanicus for the first time. DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities for crude ethanol extract (CEE), ethyl acetate fraction (EAF), butanol fraction (BF) and compounds 1, 3, 8, 10, 11 and 13 were performed. CEE, compounds 1, 3, 11 and 13 exhibited potent antioxidant activities. Compound 1 was found to increase the melanin content and tyrosinase activity of B16 melanoma cells. Moreover, the quantitative estimation of compound 1 in the ethyl acetate fraction was carried out by UPLC-DAD and the method was validated. This is the first report on the isolation and bioactivity research on the non-valotile components of H. seravshanicus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a The Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone and State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Urumqi , P.
