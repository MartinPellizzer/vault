In this study, a large-scale targeted metabolomics analysis on two types of leaf tissues of nine tea cultivars from five representative geographical origins within China was carried out using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry technique. RNA-seq-based transcriptomic analysis was in parallel conducted on the same samples, and gene expression and metabolic differentiation between tissues as well as between the multiple tea cultivars were investigated. The data obtained provide an accessible resource for further studies of naturally occurring metabolic variation of tea plants, which will aid in thoroughly interpreting the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms of biosynthesis of specialized metabolites in this critical species. Candidate genes including a transcription factor (CsMYB5-like), which were highly correlated with both the content of flavonoids and the expression level of genes participating in the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, were identified as potential targets for quality improvement of tea."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Biology (MOE), College of Horticulture and Forestry Sciences, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Haiji", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Thermo Fisher Scientific, Shanghai 201206, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Xiang", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Biology (MOE), College of Horticulture and Forestry Sciences, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China."}], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Haoliang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Biology (MOE), College of Horticulture and Forestry Sciences, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qinghua", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Thermo Fisher Scientific, Shanghai 201206, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Pengyi", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Thermo Fisher Scientific, Shanghai 201206, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Ziquan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Youyi Xilu 127, 710072 Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Lyu", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1298-9947"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Biology (MOE), College of Horticulture and Forestry Sciences, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China."}], "LastName": "Ni", "ForeName": "Dejiang", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biology 1, BioSC, Rheinisch-Westfaelische Technische Hochschule Aachen, 52056 Aachen, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IBG-2, Plant Sciences, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich, Wilhelm Johnen Str, 52024 J\u00fclich, Germany."}], "LastName": "Usadel", "ForeName": "Bj\u00f6rn", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max-Planck-Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology, Am Muehlenberg 1, Potsdam-Golm 14476, Germany."}], "LastName": "Fernie", "ForeName": "Alisdair R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3413-4766"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Biology (MOE), College of Horticulture and Forestry Sciences, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Weiwei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Camellia sinensis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32302110", "10.1021/acs.jafc.0c00434"]}}]}
