The identification and determination of sennosides were performed with thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. The leaf of Malva verticillata L. did not contain sennosides A or B and could be easily distinguished from senna leaf. Our previous report showed that sennosides are contained in weight-reducing herbal teas including malva leaves, and that senna leaf is a herbal component in some teas. Furthermore, in 10 samples of health tea including malva leaves that were bought last year, the smallest amount of sennosides was 6.1 mg/bag, and all health teas including malva leaves contained the leaf and midrib of senna. We suggest that sennosides A and B are not contained in the leaf of Malva verticillata L., and that the sennosides in health teas including malva leaves are not derived from malva leaf but from senna leaf."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kanagawa Prefectural Public Health Laboratory: 1-1-1, Nakao, Asahi-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 241-0815, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kojima", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kishi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sekita", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Satake", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Shokuhin Eiseigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0142214", "ISSNLinking": "0015-6426"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthraquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sennosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8013-11-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Senna Extract"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Anthraquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Senna Extract"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Senna Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sennosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11577394", "10.3358/shokueishi.42.202"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
