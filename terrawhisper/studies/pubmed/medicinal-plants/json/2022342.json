Antiperoxidative enzymatic activities and antioxidants content were related to seasonal variations in irradiance and precipitation. Retama was found to possess a very efficient removal mechanism for hydrogen peroxide as was shown by the high catalase activity and the high affinity of the ascorbate-glutathione pathway enzymes to their substrates. The increase in irradiance during the spring (March to May) was accompanied by increasing antioxidative enzymatic activities and ascorbate content. A marked enhancement in catalase activity also accompanied the increased light intensity during the spring. Changes in the enzymatic activities of the ascorbate-glutathione pathway followed the increased ascorbate content. These results suggest that physiological adaptation of Retama involves efficient H2O2 removal mechanisms which respond to different seasonal and environmental stresses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural Botany, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel."}], "LastName": "Mittler", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nir", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tel-Or", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Res Commun", "NlmUniqueID": "8709453", "ISSNLinking": "8755-0199"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.11", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbate Peroxidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.8.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Reductase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.8.5.1", "NameOfSubstance": "glutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbate Peroxidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Desert Climate"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Reductase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2022342", "10.3109/10715769109088937"]}}]}
