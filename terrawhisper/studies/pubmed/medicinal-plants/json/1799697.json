Strain JS314 failed to nodulate several soybean varieties tested. However, on a few varieties nodulelike structures were induced to a frequency of 54% of the plants inoculated. The ultrastructure of these nodules was studied in detail by light and electron microscopy. The nodules were devoid of internal bacteria, possessed central vascular tissue (unlike the lateral vascular tissue of a normal nodule), and exhibited localized cell death of epidermal cells. Study of the cell surface polysaccharides of strain JS314 revealed that the exopolysaccharide of this strain was identical to that of the wild type. However, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of strain JS314 showed gross differences from that isolated from the wild-type strain. Specifically, the LPS of strain JS314 appeared to lack the high molecular weight LPS I form, strongly suggesting that the LPS lacks the O-chain. Glycosyl-composition analysis showed that the LPS of mutant JS314 lacked 2,3-di-O-methylrhamnose, 3-O-methylrhamnose, fucose, and quinovosamine. These results indicate that LPS I in B. japonicum is essential for bacterial infection of soybean, but is not required to initiate plant cortical cell division, an early plant response to infection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Legume Research, University of Tennessee 37996-0845."}], "LastName": "Stacey", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "So", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Roth", "ForeName": "L E", "Initials": "LE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lakshmi SK", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Carlson", "ForeName": "R W", "Initials": "RW"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM33494", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "GM39583-02", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "GM40183", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Plant Microbe Interact", "NlmUniqueID": "9107902", "ISSNLinking": "0894-0282"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Recombinant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Recombinant"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "microbiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Fixation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Symbiosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1799697", "10.1094/mpmi-4-332"]}}]}
