Results indicated superiority of aspartic acid over phenyl alanine on increasing different growth parameters, chlorophyll b, biological and seed yields/plant, biological, seed and oil yields (kg/fed.), % of carbohydrate in peanut seeds. Meanwhile, phenyl alanine was superior on increasing carotenoids, indole acetic acid, phenolics, free amino acids, flavonoids, Lycopene, \u03b2-Carotene contents, antioxidant activity expressed as (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl DPPH %) and shilling percentage. In addition, aspartic acid and phenyl alanine with various levels caused significant increases in growth and seed yield quantity and quality of peanut plants through increases in photosynthetic pigments, indole acetic acid, phenolics and free amino acids contents. Aspartic acid was more effective than phenyl alanine, Foliar treatment with 100 mg/L aspartic acid increased oil yield (700.36 over 568.05 ton/fed.) and seed yield (1531.98 over 1253.49 kg/fed.). Finally, it can conclude that using aspartic acid and phenyl alanine as foliar treatment improved growth and yield of ground nut plants under sandy soil."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9658-7886"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Centre, Agricultural and Biological Institute, Botany Department, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Sadak", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7695-3401"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Centre, Agricultural and Biological Research Institute, Field Crops Research Department, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Bakry", "ForeName": "B A", "Initials": "BA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2445-7588"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Centre, Pharmaceutical Industries and Drugs Institute, Department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abdel-Razik", "ForeName": "T M", "Initials": "TM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7495-3734"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ain Shams University, Faculty of Education, Department of Biological and Geological Sciences, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hanafy", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101129542", "ISSNLinking": "1519-6984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sand"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "30KYC7MIAI", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspartic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OF5P57N2ZX", "NameOfSubstance": "Alanine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arachis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sand"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aspartic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alanine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "34"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36753149", "10.1590/1519-6984.256338", "S1519-69842023000100430"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
