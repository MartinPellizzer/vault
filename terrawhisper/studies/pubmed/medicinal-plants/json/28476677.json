This study aimed to identify and document species of medicinal plants used by local experts from riverine communities in the North Araguaia microregion in Mato Grosso State, and to further chemical and pharmacological studies on species selected based on searches in the relevant literature.", "This is a cross-sectional ethnobotanical study, with non-probabilistic sampling (n =60), that applied the snowball method to select local riverine experts who understand medicinal plant use. Socio-demographic, ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological data (vernacular name, uses, geographical origin, habit, method of preparation and part used) on medicinal plants were collected during semi-structured interviews. The results were analyzed by descriptive and quantitative means: indices of use-report (UR) were used to select plant species with therapeutic potential.", "In total, 309 plant species belonging to 86 botanical families were cited; 73% were native to Brazil, and Fabaceae was the most representative family (11.3%). Arboreal was the predominant life form (37.2%). The leaf was the most used part (28.9%). Infusion was the most commonly reported method of preparation (31.3%). The plants reported in the survey were indicated for 18 of the 22 ICD-10 disease categories. The disease categories most commonly cited were the infectious and parasitic diseases (IPD, 718 UR), digestive system diseases (DSD, 565 UR) and respiratory system diseases (RSD, 504 UR), representing 16.6%, 13.1% and 11.7%, respectively of the total UR. Dysphania ambrosioides L. was the most sighted in the IPD category 50 UR. Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. (133), Lafoensia pacari A. St.-Hil. (131), and Cecropia pachystachya Tr\u00e9cul (126) were the species with the highest UR. Bidens pilosa L., Vernonia ferruginea Less, and L. pacari, respectively, were the most cited native plants used to treat such diseases. Of the 8 investigated native plants, C. langsdorffii, and Brosimum gaudichaudii are the most prominent: in addition to having been widely studied, in terms of phytochemical and pharmacological, these species have been marketed as pharmaceutical products, with associated patent deposits.", "Local riverine experts from the North Araguaia microregion use a wide variety of medicinal plants in self-care health, especially those species used to treat IPD. The therapeutic potential of some of these plants has been scientifically validated; however, there are other species whose pharmacological effects and safety remain to be properly investigated. Thus, the present study, aside from being a basis for future chemical, pharmacological and agronomic bioprospecting studies, may contribute to the development of the management, conservation and sustainable use of medicinal flora in the microregion studied."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
