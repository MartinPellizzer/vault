The polycistronic RNA-1 encodes the viral RNA polymerase and capsid protein (CP) and the monocistronic RNA-2 encodes the 35 kDa cell-to-cell movement protein (MP). Nicotiana benthamiana plants transformed with the RCNMV MP gene were generated. When inoculated onto the MP transgenic plants, cell-to-cell movement of RNA-1 occurred at a rate similar to wild-type virus. However, long-distance (leaf-to-leaf) movement of RNA-1 was not observed. Neither CP nor virions were detected in the inoculated leaves of the MP transgenic plants. When RNA-1 was coinoculated with RNA-2 mutants, which do not express a functional MP, onto MP transgenic plants, CP and virions were readily detected and a systemic infection resulted. These results demonstrate that both RNA-1 and RNA-2 are necessary for the accumulation of both CP and virions. Furthermore, CP accumulation was found to be required for long-distance movement of RCNMV. Therefore, these data provide evidence that CP, in the form of virions, is necessary for the long-distance movement of RCNMV."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh 27695-7616, USA."}], "LastName": "Vaewhongs", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lommel", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Virology", "NlmUniqueID": "0110674", "ISSNLinking": "0042-6822"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Viral Movement Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Capsid"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Viral Movement Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Viral Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Virion"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Assembly"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7571430", "10.1006/viro.1995.1518", "S0042-6822(85)71518-8"]}}]}
