Twelve informants, three each from the four communities were called upon to assist with collection of data. The informants who include community leaders, herbalists and traditional birth attendants assisted in field expeditions. They also provided relevant information to a structured questionnaire used to solicit information on the plants of abortifacient and contraceptive importance. In all, 18 angiosperm species distributed in 14 families were identified as being efficacious. Most of the species belong to the family Euphorbiaceae. The crude drugs are prepared mainly by grinding and by decoction of the plant parts. The drugs are administered mainly as enema or by oral and vaginal insertion. There is a high rate of patronage of herbal preparation among the women folk in the four communities where the study was undertaken."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, School of Biological Sciences, University of Cape Coast, Ghana."}], "LastName": "Dali", "ForeName": "Gertrude Lucky Aku", "Initials": "GLA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, School of Biological Sciences, University of Cape Coast, Ghana."}], "LastName": "Pappoe", "ForeName": "Alexander Nii Moi", "Initials": "ANM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, School of Biological Sciences, University of Cape Coast, Ghana."}], "LastName": "Akotoye", "ForeName": "Hugh Komla", "Initials": "HK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Nigeria", "MedlineTA": "Afr J Reprod Health", "NlmUniqueID": "9712263", "ISSNLinking": "1118-4841"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Intravaginal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Contraception"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ghana"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32227744", "10.29063/ajrh2019/v23i4.11"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
