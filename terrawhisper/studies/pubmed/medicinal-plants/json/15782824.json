The isolated poly (A)+ mRNA was found to be suitable for cDNA-AFLP and suppression subtractive hybridization applications. It is a modified and consolidated protocol based on previously described methods for isolated steps and works better for medicinal and aromatic plants. High yield of poly (A)+ mRNA coupled with its amenability for downstream reactions like RT-PCR, northern blotting and cDNA synthesis for library construction is a key feature of the present protocol."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Genetic Resources and Biotechnology Division, Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow 226 015, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shukla", "ForeName": "Ashutosh K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shasany", "ForeName": "Ajit K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khanuja", "ForeName": "Suman P S", "Initials": "SP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Catharanthus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15782824"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
