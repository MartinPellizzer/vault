The pathogen that causes this disease may have its entry in Brazilian herds facilitated by the existence of a large extension of land borders. Therefore, the objective of this work was to investigate the presence of DNA and antibodies against <i>Leptospira</i> spp. in samples of vaginal mucus and serum from naturally infected bovine females from small rural dairy farms in a border region. Blood and vaginal mucus samples were collected from 70 Holstein cows, from small rural dairy farms between October 2017 and June 2018. The inclusion criteria for dairy cattle of any breed were aged over 2 years, not vaccinated against leptospirosis, and presenting a history of any reproductive problem such as abortion, stillbirth, repetition of heat, absence of heat, and lack of conception. Blood was collected by puncturing the coccygeal vein; for the collection of vaginal mucus, it was necessary to use a tampon with an applicator. For the detection of anti-<i>Leptospira</i> spp. antibodies, the sera were submitted to microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and, for DNA detection, the vaginal mucus was submitted to the PCR technique. Among the 70 cows, 42.86% had reagents in MAT and the most likely serovar was Wolffi (43.47%). In 74.28% of the vaginal mucus samples, it was possible to amplify the <i>Leptospira</i> spp. DNA. The results of this work show the presence of <i>Leptospira</i> spp. antibodies and DNA in samples of serum and vaginal mucus from naturally infected bovine females from small rural dairy farms in a border region (Brazil\u2009\u00d7\u2009Paraguay). These results demonstrate the importance of considering bovine females as potential vaginal carriers of <i>Leptospira</i> spp. Thus, it highlights the importance of further studies to better understanding of this issue, in addition to carrying out molecular and serological tests, to monitor the infection and further characterize epidemiological studies of leptospirosis in herds from regions that face this international frontier challenge."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Post-Graduation Program in Animal Science with an Emphasis in Bioactive Products, Paranaense University (UNIPAR), Umuarama, Parana, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Gon\u00e7alves", "ForeName": "Daniela Dib", "Initials": "DD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Post-Graduation Program in Animal Science with an Emphasis in Bioactive Products, Paranaense University (UNIPAR), Umuarama, Parana, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Pastre", "ForeName": "Giovani Batista", "Initials": "GB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Post-Graduation Program in Animal Science with an Emphasis in Bioactive Products, Paranaense University (UNIPAR), Umuarama, Parana, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student in the Post-Graduation Program in Animal Science with an Emphasis on Bioactive Products, (Scholarship holder PROSUP/CAPES/UNIPAR);
