In whole raw seed beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) var. \"t\u00f3rtola\", the net protein utilization (NPU), true digestibility and hemagglutinin titer were determined after 60', 90' and 120' of heat treatment, with and without 14 hours of pre-soaking. It is concluded that soaking prior to cooking is not necessary to eliminate the toxicity of dry beans, but that it does contribute to the softening of seeds and reduction of cooking time. The hemagglutinin levels of six commercial bean flours were evaluated, concluding that almost all of them presented toxic levels. The effect of the cooking methods upon the toxicity of bean flours was studied. Two raw bean flours, var. \"t\u00f3rtola\" and \"burro\" at 10% and 20%, were cooked employing different boiling times (5, 10, 15 and 30'). The two raw samples contained high hemagglutinin levels which were inactivated at 10% with 10' cooking. The presence of toxic levels was detected at 20% after 15' cooking and these were eliminated at 30' of cooking."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pak", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mateluna", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Araya", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Efecto de diversos tratamientos t\u00e9rmicos en el contenido de hemaglutininas y en la calidad prot\u00e9ica del frijol (Phaseolus vulgaris)."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Agglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Agglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["753177"]}}]}
