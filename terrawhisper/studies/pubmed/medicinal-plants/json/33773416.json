A purification scheme based on combined strong anion-exchange and size exclusion chromatography (2D-AEC-SEC) was developed for the production of non-structural protein-free foot and mouth disease vaccine, and the whole procedure was accomplished with 77.9% virus yield. Additionally, a mathematical modeling and a simulation approach based on a plate model of chromatography were developed and matched with the experimental chromatography data to improve prediction of retention behavior and save time in the development of the downstream scale-up method. The purified pooled virus fraction obtained from the final polishing step had a purity higher than 85% based on analytical size exclusion analysis. Moreover, more than 90.1% of residual DNA (rDNA) was removed from the purified vaccine. The analysis of purified virus particles by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), dynamic light scattering (DLS), high performance size exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provided clear evidence of purity and demonstrated that the final product is structurally spherical, intact particles qualified for formulation as a vaccine product."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
