Sorbaria tomentosa Lindl. Rehder is composed of antioxidant and neuroprotective polyphenolics.", "The current study was designed to explore phenolics profile via high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector (HPLC-DAD) and validated the neuroprotective and anxiolytic potentials of S. tomentosa by applying in vitro and in vivo approaches.", "The plant crude methanolic extract (St.Crm) and fractions were subjected to HPLC-DAD analysis for qualitative and quantitative assessment of phytochemicals. Samples were screened for in vitro free radicals scavenging assays by using 2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) along with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes inhibition assays. For cognitive and anxiolytic studies, mice were subjected to open field, elevated plus maze (EPM), light-dark model, Y-maze, shallow water maze (SWM), and novel object recognition (NOR) tests.", "HPLC-DAD analysis revealed the presence of high concentrations of phenolic compounds. For instance, in St.Cr, 21 phenolics were quantified, among which apigenin-7-glucoside (291.6 mg/g), quercetin (122.1 mg/g), quercetin-3-feruloylsophoroside-7-glucoside (52.6 mg/g), quercetin-7-glucoside (51.8 mg/g), ellagic acid (42.7 mg/g), luteolin (45.0 mg/g), kaempferol (40.5 mg/g), 5-feruloylquinic acid (43.7 mg/g) were present in higher concentrations. Likewise, in ethyl acetate fraction (St.Et.Ac), 21 phenolics were identified as 3,5-di-caffeoylquinic acid (177.4 mg/g) and 5-hydroxybenzoylquinic acid (46.9 mg/g) were most abundant phytochemicals. Highly valuable phenolics were also identified in other fractions including butanol (St.Bt), chloroform (St.Chf), and n-hexane (St.Hex). The various fractions exhibited concentration dependent inhibition of free radicals in DPPH and ABTS assays. Potent AChE inhibitory potentials were revealed by the test samples with St.Chf, St.Bt and St.EtAc being the most active having an IC<sub>50</sub> of 298.1, 580.1, and 606.47 \u03bcg\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Similarly, St.Chf, St.Bt, St.EtAc and St.Cr exhibited potent BChE inhibitory activity and was observed as 59.14, 54.73, 51.35 and 49.44%, respectively. A significant improvement in the exploratory behavior was observed in open field test and stress/anxiety was relieved effectively at 50-100\u00a0mg/kg. Likewise, EPM, light-dark and NOR tests revealed an anxiolytic and memory enhancing behaviors. These effects were further corroborated from the Y-maze and SWM transgenic studies that showed considerable improvement in cognition retention.", "These findings concluded that S. tomentosa possessed potential anxiolytic and nootropic efficacies and may have therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative disorders."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
