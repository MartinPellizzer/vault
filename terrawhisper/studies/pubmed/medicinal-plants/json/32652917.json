Echium amoenum extract (25, 12.5, 50 mg / kg, ip.) was administered for 28 days. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were drawn and liver and kidneys were removed for evaluating hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity of extract. Additionally, experiments were conducted to assay the enzymatic and oxidative activities.", "There was no significant difference in the levels of copper ion in the liver and kidneys among all groups. There was a significant difference in the levels of lipid peroxidation in the liver of treated groups versus the control group. The significant difference was not observed in the levels of glutathione of the liver of all groups. However, the levels of glutathione of the kidney significantly decreased in the treated groups versus the control group. There was no significant difference in the liver enzymes, including ALP, SGOT, and SGPT, between all groups. This indicates that damage increases with enhancing the time and concentrations of the extract. Biochemical analysis showed the creatinine and urea levels did not change in the treated groups versus the control group.", "According to the present findings, it is suggested that Echium amoenum causes hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity effects in dose and time-dependent manner."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Food Safety Division, Faculty of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "Mozhgan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Hygiene, School of Veterinary Medicine, Amol University of Special Modern Technologies, Amol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Araghi", "ForeName": "Atefeh", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Food Safety Division, Faculty of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shariatifar", "ForeName": "Nabi", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amol Pars Laboratory, Amol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirbaha", "ForeName": "Seyed Hooman", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Hygiene, School of Veterinary Medicine, Amol University of Special Modern Technologies, Amol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbasabadi", "ForeName": "Behrokh Marzban", "Initials": "BM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Neyshabur University of Medical Sciences, Neyshabur, Iran."}], "LastName": "Samarghandian", "ForeName": "Saeed", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Diseases Research Center, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran."}], "LastName": "Farkhondeh", "ForeName": "Tahereh", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Food Safety Division, Faculty of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadighara", "ForeName": "Parisa", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Discov Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "101157212", "ISSNLinking": "1570-1638"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Echium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "diagnosis", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Renal Insufficiency"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests, Subacute"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32652917", "10.2174/1570163817666200712170922", "CDDT-EPUB-108098"]}}]}
