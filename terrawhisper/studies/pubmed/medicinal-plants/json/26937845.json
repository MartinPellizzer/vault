New Caledonia is even considered as one of the 34 'hot spots' for biodiversity. Considering the current global loss of biodiversity and the fact that several drugs and pesticides become obsolete, there is an urgent need to increase sampling and research on new natural products. In this context, here, we reviewed the chemical knowledge available on New Caledonian native flora from economical perspectives. We expect that a better knowledge of the economic potential of plant chemistry will encourage the plantation of native plants for the development of a sustainable economy which will participate in the conservation of biodiversity. This review is divided into three parts, and the third part which is presented here summarizes the scientific literature related to the chemistry of endemic santalales, caryophyllales, and asterids. We show that the high rate of endemism is correlated with the originality of phytochemicals encountered in New Caledonian plants. A total of 176 original natural compounds have been identified from these plants, whereas many species have not been investigated so far. We also discuss the economic potential of plants and molecules with consideration of their medicinal and industrial perspectives. This review finally highlights several groups, such as Sapotaceae, that are unexplored in New Caledonia despite the high chemical interest in them. These plants are considered to have priority in future chemical investigations."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG, Z\u00fcrich."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut Agronomique N\u00e9o-Cal\u00e9donien, Connaissance et Am\u00e9lioration des Agrosyst\u00e8mes, BP A5, 98848, Noumea Cedex, New Caledonia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Geneva, 30, Quai Ernest-Ansermet, CH-1211, Geneva 4."}], "LastName": "Coulerie", "ForeName": "Paul", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre de Recherche de Gif, Institut de Chimie des Substances Naturelles, CNRS, Labex LERMIT, 1 Avenue de la Terrasse, FR-91198, Gif-sur-Yvette Cedex."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Stratoz, 5, Rue de la Baume, FR-75008, Paris."}], "LastName": "Poullain", "ForeName": "Cyril", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biodivers", "NlmUniqueID": "101197449", "ISSNLinking": "1612-1872"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodiversity"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "New Caledonia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26937845", "10.1002/cbdv.201500101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
