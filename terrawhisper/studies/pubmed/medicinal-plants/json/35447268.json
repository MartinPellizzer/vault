Fli-1 binds to the promoter or enhancer of the target genes and participates in a variety of physiological and pathological processes of tumor cells, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The expression of Fli-1 gene is related to the specific biological functions and characteristics of the tissue in which it is located. In tumor research, Fli-1 gene is used as a specific marker for the occurrence, metastasis, efficacy, and prognosis of tumors, thus, a potential new target for tumor diagnosis and treatment. These studies indicated that Fli-1 may be a specific candidate for antitumor drug development. Recent studies identified small molecules regulating Fli-1 thanks to our screened strategy of natural products and their derivatives. Therefore, in this review, the advanced research on Fli-1 as a target for antitumor drug development is analyzed in different cancers. The inhibitors and agonists of Fli-1 that regulate its expression are introduced and their clinical applications in the treatment of cancer, thus providing new therapeutic strategies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
