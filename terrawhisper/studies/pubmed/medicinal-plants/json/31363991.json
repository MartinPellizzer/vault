Mushrooms from genus Boletus and its related genus are one of the most important EcMF which are consumed worldwide as wild edible mushrooms. Yunnan province (China) is a high biodiversity of genus Boletus mushrooms but is also an area with potential elevated contents of toxic elements in soil. Total contents of As, Ag, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sb, Sr, Tl, U, V, and Zn in three edible EcMF species collected from five sites of Yunnan were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. The highest contents for As, Cd, and Pb were 7.8\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> dry weight (dw) in the caps of Butyriboletus roseoflavus, 3.4\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> dw in the caps of B. roseoflavus, and 6.4\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> dw in the stipes of Hemileccinum impolitum. Health risk assessment of As, Cd, and Pb indicated that the estimated exposure due to intakes of some mushroom samples from the sites were above the limits recommended by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives. Since EcMF were considered as bioexclusors of Cr, higher Cr contents in the mushroom samples, compared with previous studies, indicated high geochemical background value of Cr in the sampling sites. Relatively higher V contents in mushrooms from family Boletaceae could also associate with the high V contents in Yunnan soil. Further work is needed to identify the places in Yunnan with geochemical anomalies resulting in high levels of toxic elements in EcMF."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7737-0785"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, 650200, China. zjyaas@hotmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Plant Resources and Sustainable Use, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Mengla, 666303, China. zjyaas@hotmail.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Trace Element Analysis by Spectroscopy Method, Adam Mickiewicz University, 61-614, Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "Bara\u0142kiewicz", "ForeName": "Danuta", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Trace Element Analysis by Spectroscopy Method, Adam Mickiewicz University, 61-614, Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "Han\u0107", "ForeName": "Anetta", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, 650200, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Chemistry & Ecotoxicology, University of Gda\u0144sk, 80-309, Gda\u0144sk, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental and Computational Chemistry Group, University of Cartagena, Cartagena, 130015, Colombia."}], "LastName": "Falandysz", "ForeName": "Jerzy", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, 650200, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuanzhong", "Initials": "Y"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "31660591", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biol Trace Elem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7911509", "ISSNLinking": "0163-4984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mycorrhizae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31363991", "10.1007/s12011-019-01843-y", "10.1007/s12011-019-01843-y"]}}]}
