Results showed that 6-BA 90 mg\u00b7L\u207b\u00b9(B1), 6-BA 60 mg\u00b7L\u207b\u00b9(B2),6-BA 30 mg\u00b7L\u207b\u00b9+urea 300 mg\u00b7L\u207b\u00b9 (C1), 6-BA 60 mg\u00b7L\u207b\u00b9+urea 300 mg\u00b7L\u207b\u00b9(C2),6-BA 60 mg\u00b7L\u207b\u00b9+ ammonium bicarbonate 300 mg\u00b7L\u207b\u00b9(C4) significantly increased bud germination in the early period, and the plants quickly set up new system of photosynthesis, the branches in a month of which were higher than the control group respectively by 165.9%, 115.76%, 103.86%, 104.50%, 81.67%.However the branches developed the next year and the dry weight of leaves per plant in group B1 and B2 were much lower than that in control group. The groups that use 6-BA and nitrogen at the same time reaped a good yield of leaves even though the treatment had no significant influence on the branches developed the next year. The dry weight of leaves of C1, C2, C4 treatments were 36.80%, 32.84%, 45.97% more than the control group respectively. Therefore, C1, C2 and C4 treatments are the more appropriate to promote recovery after harvest. Furthermore, different groups, except 10 mg\u00b7L\u207b\u00b9 6-BA treatment significantly reduced the content of epimedin C, other groups didn't have any significant effect on the contents of such flavonoids."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sinopharm Group Tongjitang\uff08Guizhou\uff09Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Guiyang 550009, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sinopharm Group Tongjitang\uff08Guizhou\uff09Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Guiyang 550009, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Zhi-Hai", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sinopharm Group Tongjitang\uff08Guizhou\uff09Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Guiyang 550009, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sinopharm Group Tongjitang\uff08Guizhou\uff09Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Guiyang 550009, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiang-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Bao-Lin", "Initials": "BL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "110642-44-9", "NameOfSubstance": "epimedin C"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Epimedium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29945373", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180329.004"]}}]}
