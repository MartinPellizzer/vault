Data were collected through structured questionnaires. Pregnant women were interviewed about use of medicinal plants during pregnancy and attitudes toward such use, as well as use of pharmaceutical drugs during pregnancy. Specific questions were asked regarding 10 medicinal plants commonly used in Ethiopia and the treatment of 15 common disorders during pregnancy. Women's perspectives were assessed by eight statements from the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire-general and five pregnancy-specific statements. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between maternal sociodemographic factors and the use of medicinal plants during pregnancy.", "A total of 360 (60.0%) women used medicinal plants during their pregnancy, most commonly Ocimum lamiifolium (basil) (37.2%) and Zingiber officinale (ginger) (36.7%). The most common reasons for use were common cold, headache, and \"mitch.\" Most women (93.9%) did not disclose their use of medicinal plants to their health care providers. Concomitant use of medicinal plants and pharmaceutical drugs occurred among 11.0%, 11.5%, and 7.5% of women in the first, second, and third trimester, respectively. Age and marital status were significantly associated with the use of medicinal plants. Pregnant women seemed to have a more positive attitude toward pharmaceutical drugs than medicinal plants.", "This study showed extensive use of medicinal plants during pregnancy in Addis Ababa and Bati, Ethiopia. Collaboration between health workers and traditional practitioners on the safe use of medicinal plants is important to promote safer pregnancies and better health care for pregnant women and their unborn infants in Ethiopia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Community Medicine and Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo , Oslo, Norway ."}], "LastName": "Nega", "ForeName": "Selamawit Seid", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Ethiopian Public Health Institute , Addis Ababa, Ethiopia ."}], "LastName": "Bekele", "ForeName": "Hiwot Moges", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Ethiopian Public Health Institute , Addis Ababa, Ethiopia ."}], "LastName": "Meles", "ForeName": "Gebremeskel Gebremichael", "Initials": "GG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 PharmacoEpidemiology and Drug Safety Research Group, School of Pharmacy, University of Oslo , Oslo, Norway ."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4 Department of Child Health, Norwegian Institute of Public Health , Oslo, Norway ."}], "LastName": "Nordeng", "ForeName": "Hedvig", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Altern Complement Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9508124", "ISSNLinking": "1075-5535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ethiopia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Complications"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30508387", "10.1089/acm.2018.0062"]}}]}
