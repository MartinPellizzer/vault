Nutmeg oil contains compounds such as myristicin and methyl eugenol. Previously, we found that inhalation of phenylpropanoid compounds increased appetite in mice. These volatile aroma compounds with appetite-enhancing effects have attracted the attention of healthcare professionals who care for older people with dementia because many of these older people have hypophagia, which leads to frailty and becoming bedridden. Thus, appetite-enhancing agents that are inexpensive and easy to administer are particularly desirable. In this study, we showed that the inhalation of nutmeg oil, myristicin and methyl eugenol produced appetite-enhancing effects in mice. Methyl eugenol alone has shown appetite-enhancing effects and locomotor-reducing effects at the same dose. In a previous study, benzylacetone produced those two effects at the same dose and also increased the body weight of mice significantly; methyl eugenol, however, did not because the mice experienced olfactory habituation after repeated inhalations of methyl eugenol. A structure-activity study showed that a carbonyl group on the aliphatic chain prevented habituation to aroma compounds, which is important information for identifying suitable phenylpropanoid compounds for long-term treatment of loss of appetite."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, 46-29 Yoshida-Shimo-Adachi-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Medicines, Daiichi University of Pharmacy, 22-1 Tamagawa-cho, Minami-ku, Fukuoka, 815-8511, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ogawa", "ForeName": "Kakuyou", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, 46-29 Yoshida-Shimo-Adachi-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan. michihoi@pharm.kyoto-u.ac.jp."}], "LastName": "Ito", "ForeName": "Michiho", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101518405", "ISSNLinking": "1340-3443"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Appetite"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Myristica"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Phytother Res. 2006 Jan;20(1):58-61", "ArticleIdList": ["16397923"]}, {"Citation": "Endocrinology. 2009 Feb;150(2):749-61", "ArticleIdList": ["18845631"]}, {"Citation": "Biol Pharm Bull. 2013;36(9):1474-81", "ArticleIdList": ["23995659"]}, {"Citation": "Planta Med. 2016 Jan;82(1-2):84-8", "ArticleIdList": ["26756819"]}, {"Citation": "J Neurosci Res. 1995 Nov 1;42(4):470-8", "ArticleIdList": ["8568933"]}, {"Citation": "Biol Pharm Bull. 2016;39(6):1077-80", "ArticleIdList": ["27251513"]}, {"Citation": "Biol Pharm Bull. 2014;37(9):1559-63", "ArticleIdList": ["25177038"]}, {"Citation": "Chem Senses. 2000 Aug;25(4):487-92", "ArticleIdList": ["10944515"]}, {"Citation": "Biol Pharm Bull. 2016;39(5):794-8", "ArticleIdList": ["27150149"]}, {"Citation": "Biol Pharm Bull. 1999 Jun;22(6):598-601", "ArticleIdList": ["10408233"]}, {"Citation": "Jpn J Nurs Sci. 2018 Oct;15(4):318-329", "ArticleIdList": ["29345106"]}, {"Citation": "Biol Pharm Bull. 2016;39(9):1559-63", "ArticleIdList": ["27582336"]}, {"Citation": "J Nat Med. 2018 Jun;72(3):798-802", "ArticleIdList": ["29569223"]}, {"Citation": "J Neurogenet. 2000 Apr;14(1):43-62", "ArticleIdList": ["10938547"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30919203", "10.1007/s11418-019-01295-7", "10.1007/s11418-019-01295-7"]}}]}
