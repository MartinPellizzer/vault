Although visfatin is usually associated with PE. Observational studies evaluating the relationship between circulating visfatin and pre-eclampsia have reported inconsistent results. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize published data on the association between visfatin and pre-eclampsia.", "Electronic databases PubMed, ISI web of science, EMBASE, Scopus and the Cochrane library were comprehensively searched for selection of eligible studies until January 5, 2020. A random-effects model and the generic inverse variance method were used for quantitative data synthesis. The assessment of study quality was performed using the e Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Sensitivity analyses and prespecified subgroup were conducted to evaluate potential heterogeneity. Random-effects meta-regression was conducted to assess the impact of potential confounders on the estimated effect sizes. The protocol for this study was registered in PROSPERO (No. CRD42018105861) in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).", "Thirteen studies comprising a total of 536 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. We observed that the pre-eclampsia risk is associated with a statistically significant elevation of visfatin level [SMD (1.33\u2009\u00b5g/l) (95% CI 0.37, 2.2) <i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.007]. No significant publication bias was observed in the meta-analysis. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses indicated that the pooled effects size were affected by systolic blood pressure [SMD (1.82\u2009\u00b5g/l) 95% CI (0.94, 2.7), <i>p</i>\u2009<\u2009.05], gestational age [SMD (2.01\u2009\u00b5g/l) 95% CI (0.57, 3.4), <i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.006], body mass index [SMD (1.6\u2009\u00b5g/l) 95% CI (0.37, 3), <i>p</i>\u2009<\u2009.05] and pregnancy trimesters[SMD (2.3\u2009\u00b5g/l) 95% CI (0.95, 3.7), <i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.001]. Random-effects meta-regression showed a significant association of visfatin level with potential confounders including systolic blood pressure, gestational age and birth weight at delivery of pre-eclampsia patients.", "Collectively, our data revealed that the increase of visfatin level can be associated with the risk of pre-eclampsia. However, further studies on pre-eclampsia populations are warranted for corroboration of our findings."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Proteomics Research Center, Faculty of Paramedical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amiri-Dashatan", "ForeName": "Nasrin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Koushki", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khodabandehloo", "ForeName": "Hadi", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fathi", "ForeName": "Mjtaba", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9166-419X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Doustimotlagh", "ForeName": "Amir Hossein", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Proteomics Research Center, Faculty of Paramedical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rezaei-Tavirani", "ForeName": "Mostafa", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101136916", "ISSNLinking": "1476-4954"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.2.12", "NameOfSubstance": "Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Mass Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pre-Eclampsia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Trimesters"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32635792", "10.1080/14767058.2020.1789581"]}}]}
