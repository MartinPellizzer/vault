First, in silico ADMET predictions and physicochemical property analysis of the compounds provided insights into solubility and permeability, then density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to analyse their ionization energies, nucleophilicity, in vitro electron affinity, dipole moments and molecular interactions under vacuum and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) conditions. After calculating the theoretical inhibition constants, IC<sub>50</sub> values determined from enzymatic inhibition were found between 12.93 and 45.77\u00a0\u03bcM. Molecular docking evaluation revealed favorable hydrogen bonding and \u03c0-interactions of the compounds within the bCA active site. The experimentally most active compound, 6p, exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity with a theoretical inhibition constant value of 9.41\u00a0nM and H-bonds with Gln91, Thr198, and Trp4 residues and His63 Pi-cation interactions with His63 residues. Overall, the study reveals promising bCA blocking potential for the synthesized derivatives, similar to acetazolamide."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
