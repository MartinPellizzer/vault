Ardeid-wading birds are the natural reservoir of JEV; nonetheless, pigs are frequently a key amplifying host during epidemics in human populations. Although more domestic animals and wildlife are JEV hosts, it is unclear how these animals fit into the ecology and epidemiology of the virus. Even though there is no specific therapy, vaccines are available to prevent this infection. However, current vaccinations do not work against every clinical isolate and can cause neurological problems in certain people. In this study, we have screened 501 phytochemical compounds from various plants from the Zingeberaceae family against the RdRp protein of JEV. Based on this, the top five compounds (IMPHY014466, IMPHY004928, IMPHY007097, IMPHY014179 and IMPHY005010) were selected based on the obtained docking scores, which was above -8.0\u2009Kcal/mol. Further, the binding affinity of these selected ligands was also analysed using molecular interaction, and the presence of interactions like hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic bonds and polar bonds with respective active residues were identified and studied elaborately. Furthermore, the dynamic stability of the docked RdRp protein with these selected phytochemicals was studied using Molecular dynamic simulation and essential dynamics. The free energy landscape analysis also provided information about the energy transition responsible stability of the complex. The results obtained advocated phytochemical compounds from the zingeberaceae family for future experimental validation, as these compounds exhibited significant potential as JEV antagonists.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
