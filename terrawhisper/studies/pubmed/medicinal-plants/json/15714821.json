Transmitters levels were recovered individually after stop the perfusion with NaN3. TZ can postpone the decrease of ACh and advance the recover of Ch. The effect of TZ coupled with duxil on increasing ACh level is more obviously than effect of TZ or duxil. TZ is also showing a tendency to postpone the decrease of catecholamine and advance its recovery. TZ coupled with duxil can advance the recovery of DOPAC and adjust the metabolic abnormity positively.", "TZ has effect on protecting impairment of choline neurosystem, which induced by damage of mitochondrion and abnormity of energy metabolism; coupled with duxil have synergistic action.
