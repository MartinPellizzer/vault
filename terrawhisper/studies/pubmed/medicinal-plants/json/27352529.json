In Gansu and Inner Mongolia, the current major cultivation method was 2 - 3 years of seedling transplantation method, while the 3 - 5 years of seed-directly-sowed method in Inner Mongolia had been almost abandoned, and the 6 - 8 years of mountain direct seeding method was still in application in Hunyuan county of Shanxi province. On the other hand, the harvest method of Astragalus membranaceus var. mongholicus had been gradually changed from manual harvesting in ancient times to the current mechanical harvesting although the latter method did more damage to environment of cultivation areas and the resource of Astragalus membranaceus var. mongholicus in regions Hunyuan county of Shanxi. Through investigating the processing methods of Astragalus membranaceus var. mongholicus in different cultivation areas, it was found that processing method varied from area to area, and no unified specifications had been formulated on processing methods in market. In addition, the current processing method was too complicated in processing the slices of prepared Astragali Radix and most were self processing by farmers themselves, creating market disorders. Moreover, the Astragali Radix products were basically without grading classification but sold as bulk cargo.", "It is urgent to unify the specifications and grades of Astragali Radix product, and standardize its processing methods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "He-ting", "Initials": "HT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Ming-en", "Initials": "ME"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Hai-yan", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Hua-sheng", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "922OP8YUPF", "NameOfSubstance": "Huang Qi"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Astragalus propinquus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27352529"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
