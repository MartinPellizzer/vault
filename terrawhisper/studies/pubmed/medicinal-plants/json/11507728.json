The effect of the extract and BHA were also examined on lung, kidney and forestomach for the activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST), DT-diaphorase (DTD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. A significant increase in the levels of acid soluble sulphydryl (-SH) content, cytochrome P450, cytochrome P450 reductase, cytochrome b5 reductase, GST, DTD and SOD were observed at both dose levels of extract treatment while catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase (GR) showed significant increases only at the higher dose in the liver. Both Andrographis treated groups showed a significant decrease in activity of LDH and malondialdehyde (MDA) formation. BHA treated mice showed a significant increase in the levels of cytochrome b(5), GST, DTD, -SH content, GR and catalase in liver; while LDH and MDA levels were reduced significantly compared with their control values. In the lung, SOD, catalase and DTD, in the kidney catalase, DTD and GST, and in the forestomach SOD and DTD showed a significant increase at both dose levels of treatment. In BHA treated mice GST, DTD and catalase were significantly induced in the lung and along with these enzymes SOD was also induced in the kidney. In the case of the forestomach of BHA treated mice GST, DTD and SOD were enhanced significantly. These findings indicate the chemopreventive potential of Andrographis paniculata against chemotoxicity including carcinogenicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Biology Laboratory, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi-110067, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "R P", "Initials": "RP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Banerjee", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "25013-16-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Butylated Hydroxyanisole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.8.1.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Dihydrolipoamide Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Transferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Butylated Hydroxyanisole"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dihydrolipoamide Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11507728", "10.1002/ptr.730", "10.1002/ptr.730"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
