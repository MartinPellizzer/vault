Medicinal plants may represent a useful source of new effective therapeutic agents, particularly considering the new findings concerning the mediators of inflammation, such as prostaglandins and nitric oxide. In fact, the discovery of two isoforms of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, has opened new interesting perspectives in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. As cyclooxygenase, also nitric oxide synthase, the enzyme which converts L-arginine to nitric oxide, exists in two isoforms. It appears that the constitutive isoforms of both enzymes (cyclooxygenase-1 and constitutive nitric oxide synthase) have a regulatory-physiological role, whereas the inducible isoforms (cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase) are involved in inflammation. A number of medicinal plants have been screened for their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 and/or inducible nitric oxide synthase activity and/or expression."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental Pharmacology, University of Naples Federico II, via Montesano 49, Naples, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sautebin", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Fitoterapia", "NlmUniqueID": "16930290R", "ISSNLinking": "0367-326X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Prostaglandins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "NOS2 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Prostaglandins"}], "NumberOfReferences": "62"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10930713", "10.1016/s0367-326x(00)00181-7", "S0367326X00001817"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
