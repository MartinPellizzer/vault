The formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were detected by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin (DCF) fluorescence and calorimetric method, respectively. The percentage of cell apoptosis was monitored by flow cytometry. The expression of p53 was detected by immuno-fluorescence and flow cytometry.", "Ethanol significantly impaired the survival of PC12 cells as demonstrated by MTT assay. Ethanol also induced significant ROS formation and increased LDH release. Pre-incubation with Tan IIA in the culture medium significantly reversed these changes. Ethanol caused cell apoptosis and the upregulation of p53 protein. The anti-apoptosis effects of Tan IIA on ethanol-induced toxicity were accompanied by the downregulation of pro-apoptotic p53 protein expression.", "Tan IIA can protect neurons from apoptosis and might serve as a potential therapeutic drug for neurological disorders induced by ethanol."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Xian-Fang", "Initials": "XF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Xiao-Jing", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Xin-Min", "Initials": "XM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chun", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abietanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}, {"RegistryNumber": "03UUH3J385", "NameOfSubstance": "tanshinone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abietanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "PC12 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16723082", "10.1111/j.1745-7254.2006.00324.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
