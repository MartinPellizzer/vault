In the present study, the phytochemical profile of the ethyl acetate, methanol, and aqueous extracts (prepared by infusion and decoction) of Centaurea bornmuelleri Hausskn. aerial parts was established. The enzyme inhibitory and antioxidant properties were also determined by in vitro bioassays. Methanol extract (38.58\u202fmg gallic acid equivalent/g extract) and ethyl acetate extract (38.83\u202fmg rutin equivalent/g extract) possessed the highest concentration of phenolics and flavonoids, respectively. Aqueous extract prepared following traditional infusion method showed potent DPPH (38.54\u202fmg TE/g extract) and ABTS (57.75\u202fmg TE/g extract) scavenging abilities. The methanol extract (101.46\u202fmg TE/g extract) of C. bornmuelleri exhibited potent reducing activity in the CUPRAC assay while the aqueous extract obtained by infusion was more active in the FRAP assay (69.81\u202fmg TE/g extract). Ethyl acetate extract of C. bornmuelleri inhibited both acetylcholinesterase (1.14\u202fmg galantamine equivalent [GALAE]/g extract), butyrylcholinesterase (0.63\u202fmg GALAE/g extract), tyrosinase (69.84\u202fmg kojic acid equivalent/g extract), amylase (19.90\u202fmg acarbose equivalent [ACAE]/g extract), and glucosidase (33.12\u202fmg ACAE/g extract). The phytochemical profile of C. bornmuelleri has been characterized and the main components quantified in order to provide scientific base to design innovative products including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics or nutraceuticals although further investigation concerning the isolation of the main bioactive compounds would be required."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
