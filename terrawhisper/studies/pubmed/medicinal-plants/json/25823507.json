A safety threshold of 0.125\u2030 blood alcohol concentration following the administration of a single dose has been recommended by the European Medicines Agency.The aim of this clinical study was to prove the safety of administering a fixed combination of thyme herb and primrose root fluid extract (Bronchicum(\u00ae) Elixir) containing 4.9% ethanol.", "The herbal drug was administered for a period of 7-9 days to 16 children (ages 1-12 years) suffering from acute bronchitis for \u2264 48\u2009h. After 3-5 days, a blood sample was taken 45\u2009min (children \u2265 5 years: also 0 and 90\u2009min) after application of the drug. The efficacy was assessed using the Bronchitis Severity Score. Global efficacy and tolerability were rated by the investigator and patients.", "All measured blood ethanol concentrations were below the threshold (mean value after 45\u2009min: 0.0029 \u00b1 0.0057\u2030 and after 90\u2009min: 0.0051 \u00b1 0.0078\u2030). The Bronchitis Severity Score decreased from 6.6 \u00b1 1.0 to 0.9 \u00b1 1.6 points. Global efficacy was assessed as \"very good\" and \"good\" in 60% (investigator) and 80% (patients) of cases.
