Commiphora mukul oleo gum resin has been considered for a long time due to its various properties such as milk-enhancing, diuretic, and healing the mouth and larynx wounds. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of Commiphora mukul oleo gum resin on wound healing in rats. Forty-two albino Wistar rats have randomly divided into six groups: The first group was without treatment, the second group was treated with Eucerin, the third group was treated with phenytoin cream %1, the fourth to sixth groups were treated with Commiphora mukul ointment 2%, 4%, and 8% respectively. Treatment was performed once a day for 14 days, and the wound area was measured daily. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were taken to measure vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). The histological evaluation and the strength test of the repaired tissue were performed. The results showed that seven days after treatment, the wound area decreased significantly in the groups treated with mukul gum extract compared to the control groups (p0.05). At the end of the experiment, there was no significant difference in wound area reduction between the groups. Commiphora mukul gum extract increased VEGF and significantly improved skin elasticity. The results of this study indicate the Wound healing potential of Commiphora mukul."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, 48407Ahvaz Jundishapur University of medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Malayeri", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plant Research center, Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, 48407Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abdevand", "ForeName": "Zeinab Zaheri", "Initials": "ZZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, 48407Ahvaz Jundishapur University of medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rashedi", "ForeName": "Masoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Traditional Medicine, 37552Mashhad University of medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hamedi", "ForeName": "Shokouh Sadat", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Science, faculty of Veterinary Medicine, 48513Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Basir", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0606-2937"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plant Research center, Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, 48407Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Golfakhrabadi", "ForeName": "Fereshteh", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Low Extrem Wounds", "NlmUniqueID": "101128359", "ISSNLinking": "1534-7346"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36113432", "10.1177/15347346221123640"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
