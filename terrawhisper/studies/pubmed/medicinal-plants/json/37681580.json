However, it is worth noting that they may also have bioactivity. This study aims to examine the potential impact of key flavors and their nanocapsules on health and diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The 36 nanocapsules of key flavorings were prepared by high shear homogenization (HSH). Seventy-two male Sprague-Dawley rats received a single dosage of streptozotocin (35 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> body weight) intraperitoneally. All of the nutritional and biochemical parameters were statistically analyzed. A virtual docking study was conducted. Linalool nanoemulsion results showed the highest encapsulation efficiency (86.76%), while isoamyl acetate nanoparticles showed the lowest (69.99%). According to GC-MS analysis, encapsulation did not affect the flavoring structure with particle size distributions ranging from 277.3 to 628.8 nm. Using TEM, nanoemulsion particles appeared spherical with a desired nanometric diameter size. In the oral glucose tolerance test, flavorings in oil and nanoforms had no discernible hypoglycemia effects in normal rats. The nutritional and biochemical parameters confirmed that both normal and nanoencapsulation forms demonstrated a potential anti-hyperglycemic effect, and enhanced the rat health compared to the raw flavorings. The studied flavorings and their nanocapsules seem to have the potential double effect of a flavor compound as a food palatability enhancer with a potential beneficial effect on type 2 diabetes mellitus without any health drawbacks."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3376-5010"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition and Food Sciences, National Research Centre, Dokki, Cairo, 12622, Egypt. dina_ganna@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Mohammed", "ForeName": "Dina Mostafa", "Initials": "DM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Jouf University, Sakaka 72341, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Abdelgawad", "ForeName": "Mohamed A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy Practice, College of Pharmacy, AlMaarefa University, Ad Diriyah 13713, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy and Medicinal Plants Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University, Cairo 11884, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ghoneim", "ForeName": "Mohammed M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, AlMaarefa University, Riyadh 11597, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura 35516, Egypt."}], "LastName": "El-Sherbiny", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Mahdi", "ForeName": "Wael A", "Initials": "WA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0922-9819"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alshehri", "ForeName": "Sultan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh 11671, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ebrahim", "ForeName": "Hasnaa A", "Initials": "HA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Flavour and Aroma Chemistry Department, National Research Centre, Dokki, Cairo, 12622, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Farouk", "ForeName": "Amr", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Funct", "NlmUniqueID": "101549033", "ISSNLinking": "2042-6496"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nanocapsules"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanocapsules"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37681580", "10.1039/d3fo01299a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
