The cells were identified by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry and tested the ability to intake ac-LDL. Cell clusters were viewed with an inverted microscope, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of PE-CD34 and FITC-AC133 was performed to detect number of EPCs, EPC proliferation and migration were assayed with MTT assay, modified Boyden chamber assay. EPCs adhesion ability assay was performed by replating cells on fibronectin-coated dishes, and then counting adherent cells.", "Numbers of EPCs (10(3) cells per 1 mL peripheral blood) of treatment group was higher than control group (7.20 +/- 1.29 vs 6.88 +/- 1.00). Compared with group control, numbers of clusters (per 40 power microscopic field), adhesive EPCs (per 400 power microscopic field) and migratory EPCs (per 200 power microscopic field) of treatment group were significantly increased (4.47 +/- 0.94 vs 3.38 +/- 0.57, P <0.01, 11.81 +/- 2.29 vs 10.03 +/- 1.32, P <0.05 and 15.75 +/- 2.27 vs 11.95 +/- 1.28, P <0.01, respectively), while OD vallue of treatment group were significantly increased too (0.27 +/- 0.04 vs 0. 20 +/- 0.03, P < 0.01).", "Danshen can significantly enhance EPCs functional activity of patients with Hypercholesterolemia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, Wenzhou 325000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Kang-ting", "Initials": "KT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Huai-qin", "Initials": "HQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Ji-fei", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hai-ying", "Initials": "HY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, CD34"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, CD34"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Movement"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypercholesterolemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Stem Cells"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17802891"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
