There has been increasing interest in its therapeutic application in depression. However, the mechanisms behind behavioural changes are still poorly understood. Chronic mild stress (CMS)-induced preference behaviour change has been used as a model to predict the clinical efficacy of many types of antidepressant treatment. Both EtOH and water extracts (AE and WE) of Banxia-houpu decoction exhibited a significantly increased sucrose intake in the CMS model in rats, but there was no effect in unstressed animals. In the present study, it was found that the c-fos expression in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum corpora were very high in the CMS model in rats. WE and AE at a dose of 130 mg/kg exhibited a significantly decreased c-fos expression in the cerebral regions in CMS model in rats, respectively. The former was more potent than the latter. However, no significant changes in the c-fos expression were observed in unstressed rats treated with the decoction. Fluoxetine not only significantly reduced c-fos expression in all regions in the CMS model in rats, but only showed a marked decrease in c-fos expression in the hippocampus in unstressed animals. A different molecular mechanism of Banxia-houpu decoction and fluoxetine may be implied. The cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum conpora might be important structural substrates in the central nervous system mediating the section of the Banxia-houpu decoction on preference behaviour in CMS-induced rats, and fos protein might be the common substrate of the signal transduction process of the decoction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Functional Biomolecule, State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Weiyun", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jianmei", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jixiao", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Zhenqiu", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Lingdong", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Banxia Houpo Tang"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Stress Disorders, Traumatic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15103665", "10.1002/ptr.1391"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
