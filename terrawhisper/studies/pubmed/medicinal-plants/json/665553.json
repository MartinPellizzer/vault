Two groups of subjects were studied--healthy subjects with an ileostomy and normal subjects. Both were put on a fixed diet of known cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin content. From the feces excreted the fiber components were measured by the acid and neutral detergent method. From the small bowel 84.5% of the ingested cellulose was excreted from the ileostomy subjects. From the normal subjects 22.4% of the ingested cellulose was excreted, indicating approximately 80% of the cellulose was digested in the normal subjects. From the water insoluble ingested hemicelluloses 27.5% were excreted from the small bowel, 4.0% from normal subjects. That is approximately 96% digestion of the hemicelluloses in normal subjects. Lignin was found to be undigested in both the small and large bowel. This has important implications in future fiber research."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Holloway", "ForeName": "W D", "Initials": "WD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tasman-Jones", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "S P", "Initials": "SP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Clin Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0376027", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9165"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9004-34-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Cellulose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-53-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cellulose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ileostomy"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ileum"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Intestine, Large"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Intestine, Small"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lignin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["665553", "10.1093/ajcn/31.6.927"]}}]}
