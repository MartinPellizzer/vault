According to Cohn's classification system, 4 cases were totally asymptomatic (type 1), 18 cases were asymptomatic with previous myocardial infarction (type 2) and 9 cases were asymptomatic ischemia with angina (type 3). Randomized crossing self-controlled observation methods were applied. Xinkening were used in treated group, while persantin and aspirin were used in control group. The result showed that ST-segment depression were reduced in treated and control group in comparing with those obtained before treatment, difference was significant (P < 0.01). The efficacy of treated group compared with control also were significantly different (P < 0.01), the former was better. Total time of ST-segment depression showed similar result. There was no adverse effect to heart, liver, kidney and blood. No allergic reaction was found in this observation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ningbo 1st Municipal Hospital."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "H G", "Initials": "HG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "9211576", "ISSNLinking": "1003-5370"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Electrocardiography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7950196"]}}]}
