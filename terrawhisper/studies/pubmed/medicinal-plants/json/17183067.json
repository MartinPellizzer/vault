We found that compound 343 inhibited the upregulation of cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzyme activity in cells treated with the AhR ligands and potent carcinogens, dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) or 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Compound 343 also inhibited the DMBA- or TCDD-induced increase in CYP1A1, -1A2 and -1B1 mRNA levels. Carcinogen-induced transcription of CYP genes was also suppressed by compound 343, as measured by a reporter gene controlled by the xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE). This was confirmed by measuring the amount of carcinogen-induced CYP1A1 heterogeneous nuclear RNA. Compound 343 blocked the DMBA- or TCDD-induced activation of the AhR DNA-binding capacity for the XRE, as measured by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Compound 343 also inhibited CYP enzyme activity in microsomes isolated from DMBA- or TCDD-treated cells, as well as the activity of recombinant CYP1A1, -1A2 and -1B1, indicating that compound 343 directly inhibits CYP enzymes. These results indicate that compound 343 is both a potent inhibitor of carcinogen-induced CYP enzyme expression, as well as a direct inhibitor of CYP enzymes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular Defense and Carcinogenesis Section, Laboratory of Metabolism, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sienkiewicz", "ForeName": "Pawel", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ciolino", "ForeName": "Henry P", "Initials": "HP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leslie", "ForeName": "Benjamin J", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hergenrother", "ForeName": "Paul J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singletary", "ForeName": "Keith", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yeh", "ForeName": "Grace Chao", "Initials": "GC"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Intramural NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Carcinogenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8008055", "ISSNLinking": "0143-3334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "3-(3-methoxyphenyl)-N-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)acrylamide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acrylamides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-97-6", "NameOfSubstance": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "CYP1B1 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP1B1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acrylamides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP1B1"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Induction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Isodon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Structures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17183067", "10.1093/carcin/bgl248", "bgl248"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
