Hence, this study was performed to evaluate in vitro antitrichomonal activity of Satureja khuzestanica, carvacrol, thymol, eugenol, and phytochemical evaluation of the S. khuzestanica oil.", "Extracts and essential oil of S. khuzestanica, and the components were prepared. Then, susceptibility testing was performed using the microtiter plate method and Trichomonas vaginalis isolates. The minimum lethal concentration (MLC) of the agents was determined in comparison with metronidazole. Also, the essential oil was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-flame ionization detector.", "After 48 hours of incubation, carvacrol and thymol were the most effective antitrichomonal agents with MLC of 100 \u00b5g/mL, followed by the essential oil and hexanic extract (MLC = 200 \u00b5g/mL), then eugenol and methanolic extract (MLC = 400 \u00b5g/mL), in comparison with the metronidazole MLC of 6.8 \u00b5g/mL. Overall, 33 identified compounds accounted for 98.72% of the total essential oil composition with carvacrol, thymol, and p-cymene being the major constituents.", "The results suggested the potency of S. khuzestanica and its bioactive ingredients against T. vaginalis. Thus, further in vivo studies are required to evaluate the efficacies of the agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2023 Faezeh Karami, Dara Dastan, Mohammad Fallah, Mohammad Matini."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Karami", "ForeName": "Faezeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Dastan", "ForeName": "Dara", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fallah", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Matini", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "J Infect Dev Ctries", "NlmUniqueID": "101305410", "ISSNLinking": "1972-2680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3J50XA376E", "NameOfSubstance": "Thymol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antitrichomonal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9B1J4V995Q", "NameOfSubstance": "carvacrol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3T8H1794QW", "NameOfSubstance": "Eugenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "140QMO216E", "NameOfSubstance": "Metronidazole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Thymol"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antitrichomonal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Satureja"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Eugenol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metronidazole"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}], "CoiStatement": "No Conflict of Interest is declared"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "23"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36795930", "10.3855/jidc.16360"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
