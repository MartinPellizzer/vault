This natural triterpenoid, fupenzic acid (FA), isolated from the roots of Rosa laevigata, was discovered to be capable of forming supramolecular gel spontaneously in 50 % ethanol-water solution induced by heating. Distinguished from the common thermosensitive gels, the FA-gel showed a distinctive nonreversible phase transition from the liquid to gel state upon heating. In this work, the entire gelation process of FA-gel induced by heating was recorded digitally by microrheology monitor. And a unique heat-induced gelation mechanism based on self-assembled FA has been proposed by using various experimental methods and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Its excellent injectability and stability were also demonstrated. Furthermore, the FA-gel had been evaluated to exhibit better anti-tumor activity and higher biosafety comparing with its equivalent free-drug, which opened up a new possibility to reinforce antitumor efficacy by using natural product gelator originated from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) without any complicated chemical modifications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
