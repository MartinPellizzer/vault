In order to ensure the content of active components, variable temperature drying modes were designed: low temperature at 30 \u2103 and high temperature at 60 \u2103, low temperature at 30 \u2103 and high temperature at 70 \u2103, low temperature at 30 \u2103 and high temperature at 80 \u2103, low temperature at 40 \u2103 and high temperature at 60 \u2103, low temperature at 40 \u2103 and high temperature at 70 \u2103, low temperature at 40 \u2103 and high temperature at 80 \u2103 and air dry oven was used for variable temperature drying process. Then HPLC method was used to determine the changes of active components in roots of S. miltiorrhiza f. alba under different temperature modes; and SPSS 17.0 was used to analyze the data. The results showed that the samples, which were first dried at 40 \u2103 for six hours and then dried at 80 \u2103 for three hours, had the highest contents in dihydrotanshinone, cryptotanshinone, tanshinone \u2160 and tanshinone \u2161A as compared with other kinds of drying methods, and the contents were 0.35, 2.76, 0.78, 4.47 mg\u2022g\u207b\u00b9, respectively. Additionally, as compared with samples dried in the shade, the contents of dihydrotanshinone, cryptotanshinone and tanshinone \u2160 were increased 2.9% (P>0.05), 45.3% (P<0.05) and 34.5% (P<0.05), respectively; however, the content of tanshinone \u2161A was decreased by 44.1% (P<0.05). The water-soluble active components (rosmarinic acid and salvianolic acid B) of roots of S. miltiorrhiza f. alba, had the highest contents when the samples were first dried at 30 \u2103 for six hours and then 70 \u2103 for three hours, and the contents were 3.83,55.44 mg\u2022g\u207b\u00b9, increased by 62.3% (P<0.05) and 109.1% (P<0.05) respectively as compared with the samples dried in the shade. Variable temperature drying can significantly affect the contents of active components in roots of S. miltiorrhiza f. alba. As compared with the traditional process of shade-drying process, low temperature drying can significantly increase the content of water-soluble active components and also with significant promotion effect on the liposoluble components such as tanshinone \u2161A, cryptotanshinone and tanshinone \u2160. The variable temperature drying mode, can effectively shorten the process of drying and provide theoretical basis for industrial processing of roots of S. miltiorrhiza f. alba."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Bing-Qian", "Initials": "BQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Hai-Hua", "Initials": "HH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Fan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Geng", "ForeName": "Yan-Ling", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Medicinal Materials Co., Ltd., Ji'nan 250012, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Zhen-Yu", "Initials": "ZY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abietanes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Abietanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Desiccation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29090547", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0079"]}}]}
