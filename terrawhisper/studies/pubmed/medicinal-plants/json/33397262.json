Although the short half-life (5 days) and the high price of platelet products pose challenges regarding their usage, they maintain the growth regulatory functions for weeks. Thus, we aimed to assess the supplementary values of these products in human CCRF- CEM cancer cells. Mechanistically, we also checked if the PRP/PPP treatment enhances YKL-40 expression as a known protein regulating cell growth.", "The PRP/PPP was prepared from healthy donors using manual stepwise centrifugation and phase separation. The viability of the cells treated with gradient PRP/PPP concentrations (2, 5, 10, and 15%) was measured by the MTT assay. The YKL-40 mRNA and protein levels were assessed using qRT-PCR and western blotting. The data were compared to FBS-treated cells.", "Our findings revealed that the cells treated by PRP/PPP not only were morphologically comparable to those treated by FBS but also showed greater viability at the concentrations of 10 and 15%. Moreover, it was shown that PRP/PPP induce cell culture support, at least in part, via inducing YKL-40 expression at both mRNA and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner.", "Collectively, by showing cell culture support comparable to FBS, the PRP/PPP might be used as good candidates to supplement the cancer cell culture and overcome concerns regarding the use of FBS as a non-human source in human cancer research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Talebi", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, LSUHSC, School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA, United States."}], "LastName": "Vatanmakanian", "ForeName": "Mousa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirzaei", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Barfar", "ForeName": "Yaghoub", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hemmatzadeh", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nahayati", "ForeName": "Milad A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Velaei", "ForeName": "Kobra", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Tabriz Branch, Islamic Azad.
