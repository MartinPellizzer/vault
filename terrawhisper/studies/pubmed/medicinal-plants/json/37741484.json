Drug carriers from natural biopolymers are preferred over synthetic materials due to their biocompatibility. The use of polysaccharide gums in the drug delivery system has received considerable attention in recent years. Polysaccharide gums are renewable resources and abundantly found in nature. They could be isolated from marine algae, microorganisms, and higher plants. In terms of carbohydrates, the gums are water-soluble, non-starch polysaccharides with high commercial value. Polysaccharide gums are widely used for controlled-release products, capsules, medicinal binders, wound healing agents, capsules, and tablet excipients. One of the essential applications of polysaccharide gum is drug delivery systems. The various kinds of polysaccharide gums obtained from different plants, marine algae, and microorganisms for the drug delivery system application are discussed comprehensively in this review paper."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
