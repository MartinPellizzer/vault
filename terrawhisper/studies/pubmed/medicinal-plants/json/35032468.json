It is caused by the genus Leishmania protozoa that are transmitted to humans by insect bites. This disease is a serious public health problem, which can cause death, disability, and mutilation. The drugs used in treatment have high toxicity, low efficiency, high costs, and possible antiparasitic resistance. Medicinal plant-based treatments have been used for leishmaniasis by population from endemic areas. Among the main botanical families used against leishmaniasis, in different parts of the world, the family Lamiaceae stands out. In this review, the antileishmanial activity of extracts, fractions, and non-volatile compounds of Lamiaceae species are presented. Leishmania species present in the Old and New World were evaluated and discussed. Altogether there are forty-two Lamiaceae species, belonging to twenty-six genera, and ninety-one constituents, isolated from eighteen species of this family, verified in antileishmanial assays. Chemical and biological aspects of extracts, fractions and non-volatile constituents are discussed in order to define a profile of antileishmanial plants of this family, based on the antileishmanial activities results. Notes are presented to guide future investigations to expand chemical and biological knowledge of Lamiaceae species and highlight its most promising antileishmanial agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
