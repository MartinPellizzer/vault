The structure of 1 was elucidated by extensive spectroscopic methods and the known compounds were identified by comparisons with the data reported in literature. Among them, trigonohowine (1) represents the first example of a new type of tetrahydrofuran derivative, possessing an unprecedented carbon skeleton containing 23 carbon atoms on the carbon skeleton and the known compouds (2-6) are rare tetrahydrofuran derivatives in the plant kingdom with various carbon skeletons. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their anti-HIV-1 activities. Compounds 1-6 showed significant anti-HIV-1 activities with EC<sub>50</sub> ranged from 0.08 to 1.03\u202f\u00b5M. These findings suggest that the discoveries of these tetrahydrofuran derivatives with significant anti-HIV-1 activities isolated from T. howii could be of great importance to the development of new anti-HIV agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
