When used in conjunction with the luciferase reporter genes, one of these DNA fragments, 19H, directed gene expression at a level which enabled the subsequent light output (bioluminescence) of single cells of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola to be detected and visualized using a charge-coupled device (CCD). The P. syringae pv. phaseolicola phi 11P, 19H and P. aeruginosa phi PLS27, HcM promoters gave a 50-fold increase in bioluminescence (maximum relative light output) compared to similar constructs containing other well-characterized promoters, for example, tetracycline. Similar bioluminescent characteristics of the transformed bacterium, were observed during growth with and without antibiotic-selection. When lux+ bacteria were inoculated onto French bean leaf (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), the resultant secondary halo blight lesions were bioluminescent and during phylloplane colonization by the lux+ bacterium, bioluminescence on leaf surfaces was detected and imaged by the CCD. Use of these newly identified promoters, combined with the greatly increased sensitivity of bioluminescence detection by the CCD, thus provided a new dimension for the study of natural ecological populations during the bacterial colonization of plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Aberdeen, Scotland, UK."}], "LastName": "Waterhouse", "ForeName": "R N", "Initials": "RN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Silcock", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "White", "ForeName": "H L", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Buhariwalla", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Glover", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Mol Ecol", "NlmUniqueID": "9214478", "ISSNLinking": "0962-1083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.13.12.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Luciferases"}], "GeneSymbolList": ["luxAB"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Reporter"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Luciferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescent Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Promoter Regions, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas Phages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8162227", "10.1111/j.1365-294x.1993.tb00021.x"]}}]}
