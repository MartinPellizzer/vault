Besides, the popular use \"guaco\" is indicated by the Brazilian Ministry of Health as a safe and effective herbal medicine. The biological activity of <i>M. glomerata</i> extracts is due to the presence of the coumarins, a large family of phenolic substances found in plants and is made of fused benzene and \u03b1-pyrone rings. Considering that there are few data on the biological effects of the extracts of <i>M. glomerata</i>, mainly in genetic level, this work aims to evaluate, <i>in vitro</i>, the genotoxicity and coumarin production in <i>M. glomerata</i> in conventional and organic growing. The data showed that the organic culture system showed double the concentration of coumarin being significantly more productive than the conventional system. Besides, the results of comet assay suggest that extracts of <i>M. glomerata</i> cultivated in a conventional system was genotoxic, increased DNA damage levels while the organic extracts seem to have antigenotoxic effect possibly due to the concentration of coumarins. Additional biochemical investigations are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms of action of <i>M. glomerata</i> extracts, which were found to have a role in protection against DNA damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Medicinal Plants, Graduate Programme of Environmental Sciences, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Crici\u00fama, SC, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Dos Santos", "ForeName": "Roberto Recart", "Initials": "RR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Medicinal Plants, Graduate Programme of Environmental Sciences, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Crici\u00fama, SC, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Turra", "ForeName": "Bianca", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3617-4120"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Medicinal Plants, Graduate Programme of Environmental Sciences, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Crici\u00fama, SC, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Simon", "ForeName": "Kellen", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Translational Biomedicine Laboratory, Graduate Programme of Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Crici\u00fama, SC, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Damiani", "ForeName": "Adriani Paganini", "Initials": "AP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Translational Biomedicine Laboratory, Graduate Programme of Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Crici\u00fama, SC, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Strapazzon", "ForeName": "Giulia", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Translational Biomedicine Laboratory, Graduate Programme of Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Crici\u00fama, SC, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Leandro", "ForeName": "Rafaela Tomaz", "Initials": "RT"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2986-1715"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Translational Biomedicine Laboratory, Graduate Programme of Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Crici\u00fama, SC, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Vilela", "ForeName": "Thais Ceres\u00e9r", "Initials": "TC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5002-1294"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Programme of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Crici\u00fama, SC, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Peterson", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Translational Biomedicine Laboratory, Graduate Programme of Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Crici\u00fama, SC, Brazil."}], "LastName": "de Andrade", "ForeName": "Vanessa Moraes", "Initials": "VM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Medicinal Plants, Graduate Programme of Environmental Sciences, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Crici\u00fama, SC, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Amaral", "ForeName": "Patr\u00edcia de Aguiar", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Video-Audio Media"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health B", "NlmUniqueID": "7607167", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mikania"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31258003", "10.1080/03601234.2019.1634423"]}}]}
