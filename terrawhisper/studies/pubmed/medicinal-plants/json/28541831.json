Considering that the human population consumes many foods that contain this flavonoid, the objective of this study was to investigate the genotoxic and the antigenotoxic potentials of vitexin by the SMART (Somatic Mutation and Recombination Test) in Drosophila melanogaster wings, in vivo. To evaluate the genotoxic activity, larvae obtained from standard (ST) and high bioactivation (HB) crosses were chronically treated with different concentrations of vitexin (0.15, 0.3, and 0.6\u2009mM). For the evaluation of antigenotoxic activity, the same vitexin concentrations were associated with two damage inducing agents: doxorubicin (0.2\u2009mM) and benzo[a]pyrene (1.0\u2009mM). The results obtained for genotoxic activity showed that vitexin did not induce a statistically significant increment in the frequency of mutant spots, when compared to control. The results for the evaluation of antigenotoxicity indicated that the flavonoid statistically reduced the frequency of mutant spots, when compared to those treated with only the damage inducing agents. Thus, this article presents results that have demonstrated the antigenotoxic activity of vitexin, which could be applied in new studies for the development of drugs with chemoprotective effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Biotechnology, Genetics and Cell Biology, State University of Maring\u00e1 , Maring\u00e1, Brazil ."}], "LastName": "Fernandes", "ForeName": "Liliane Menezes", "Initials": "LM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Department of Cytogenetics and Mutagenesis, State University of Mato Grosso do Sul-Unit Mundo Novo , Mundo Novo, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil ."}], "LastName": "da Rosa Guterres", "ForeName": "Zaira", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Biotechnology, Genetics and Cell Biology, State University of Maring\u00e1 , Maring\u00e1, Brazil ."}], "LastName": "Almeida", "ForeName": "Igor Vivian", "Initials": "IV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Biotechnology, Genetics and Cell Biology, State University of Maring\u00e1 , Maring\u00e1, Brazil ."}], "LastName": "Vicentini", "ForeName": "Veronica Elisa Pimenta", "Initials": "VEP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7V515PI7F6", "NameOfSubstance": "Apigenin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9VP70K75OK", "NameOfSubstance": "vitexin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Apigenin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drosophila melanogaster"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Recombination, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28541831", "10.1089/jmf.2016.0149"]}}]}
