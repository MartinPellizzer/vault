The psyllium was incorporated into high fiber, ready-to-eat (RTE) flakes that were used to formulate the test diet. All the diets contained 0.125% cholesterol. The study was terminated after three weeks. Food intake, weight gain and feed efficiency were not significantly different in the three groups. Serum total and HDL cholesterol levels were reduced significantly by the psyllium diet. Serum triglycerides were 26% lower in the hamsters fed psyllium but because of the large variation the difference did not reach statistical significance. Liver total cholesterol and cholesteryl ester levels were significantly lower in the hamsters fed psyllium. Liver triglycerides were highest in the psyllium-fed hamsters and liver phospholipid levels were similar in the three groups. Liver cholesterol and triglyceride levels were higher in hamsters fed cellulose than in those fed wheat bran. Psyllium formulated into an RTE cereal was effective in reducing serum and liver cholesterol levels in hamsters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kellogg Company, Science and Technology Center, Battle Creek, MI 49016-2432 USA."}], "LastName": "Hicks", "ForeName": "V A", "Initials": "VA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kritchevsky", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL 00734", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Artery", "NlmUniqueID": "7508494", "ISSNLinking": "0098-6127"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticholesteremic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol Esters"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8063-16-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Psyllium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9004-34-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Cellulose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anticholesteremic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cellulose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol Esters"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetinae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feeding Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mesocricetus"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Psyllium"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8833233"]}}]}
