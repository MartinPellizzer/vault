The pumpkin starches had lower pasting temperatures (by near 3\u00b0C and 24\u00b0C than potato or corn starch respectively), the peak viscosity (nearly 2300mPas lower than potato starch) and higher final viscosities (by 80-120mPas than those for potato starch and by 1700mPas in relation to corn starch). The thermal profile of pumpkin starches examined by the DSC method were quite similar to those of potato starch but lower than those of corn. The retrogradation degree of pumpkin starch was lower by 5-26% than that for corn or potato starches. The thermal treatment of starches led to the formation of radicals. Pumpkin starches were less susceptible to the formation of radicals than potato starch and had less about 0.3-1.3\u00d710<sup>15</sup>radicals/g than potato starch."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
