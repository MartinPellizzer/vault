The alkaloids were eluted on a C18 column with acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% formic acid and 10\u202fmM ammonium acetate, and separated with good resolution within 13\u202fmin. Electrospray ionization-Q-TOF (ESI-Q-TOF) analysis was performed to characterize the molecules and their fragment ions, and the characteristic ions and fragmentation patterns were used as to identify the alkaloids. The proposed analytical method was verified in reference to the ICH guidelines and the results showed excellent linearity (R<sup>2</sup>\u202f>\u202f0.9988), limit of detection (1\u202fng/mL to 10\u202fng/mL), limit of quantification (3\u202fng/mL to 30\u202fng/mL), intra-day and inter-day precisions, and extraction recovery rates (92.8% to 104.1%) for all components. The validated UPLC-Q-TOF method was applied to the analysis of extracts from the root, stem, and leaves of C. roseus, allowing the identification of six alkaloids by comparison of retention times, molecular ions, and fragmentation patterns with those of reference compounds. Sixteen additional indole alkaloids were tentatively identified by comparison of chromatograms to chemical databases and literature reports. The contents of bis-indole alkaloids (vincristine and vinblastine) were high in the aerial parts, while the contents of mono-indole alkaloids (ajmalicine, catharanthine, serpentine, and vindoline) were high in the roots. The present results demonstrate that the proposed UPLC-Q-TOF method can be useful for the investigation of phytochemical constituents of medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
