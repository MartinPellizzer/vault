Seeds were aseptically cultured in Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) with various concentrations of MWCNTs (0, 125, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml<sup>-1</sup>). Seed germination and morphological changes in seedlings were measured. The measurements were aimed at quantifying the total phenolic contents (TPC) and flavonoids (TFC), antioxidant activities and the activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO), l-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), dehydrogenase (DHA) and peroxidase enzyme (POD) of the seedling extract. Seedling biomass and seedling height grew significantly as the MWCNTs level increased. The biomass and height peaked at 250\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml<sup>-1</sup> (0.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 gr FW, 5.99\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.55\u00a0cm) and then rapidly decreased to 0.040\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 gr FW and 1.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.24\u00a0cm in response to 1000\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml<sup>-1</sup>, 30 days after the treatment. Additionally, SM and the analyses of enzyme activity revealed that the highest amounts of TPC (6.70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\u00a0mg GAE g<sup>-1</sup> DW), TFC (8.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0mg QUE g<sup>-1</sup> DW), antioxidant activities (73.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.47%) and maximum PAL activity (1.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08\u00a0mM\u00a0cm g<sup>-1</sup> FW) were detected in plants grown on MS media fortified with 250\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml<sup>-1</sup> MWCNTs. The results reveal that MWCNTs in low doses (250\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml<sup>-1</sup>) can encourage the production of biomass, elicit more SM from seedlings and enhance the biosynthesis of antioxidants. TEM images showed that MWCNTs could cross the plant cell wall and enter the cellular cytoplasm."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
