Symptomatic relief was obtained in sixteen (80%) patients on mastic and in nine (50%) patients on placebo, while endoscopically proven healing occurred in fourteen (70%) patients on mastic and four (22%) patients on placebo. The differences between treatments were highly significant (P less than 0.01). Mastic was well tolerated and did not produce side effects. It is concluded that mastic has an ulcer healing effect, but further studies are needed to establish its role in treating peptic ulcer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Al-Habbal", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Al-Habbal", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huwez", "ForeName": "F U", "Initials": "FU"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0425076", "ISSNLinking": "0305-1870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mastic Resin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Resins, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Duodenal Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mastic Resin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Resins, Plant"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6395994", "10.1111/j.1440-1681.1984.tb00864.x"]}}]}
