Many of them are used as folk medicine in the treatment of chronic coughs, asthma, nocturnal emission, spontaneous sweating, night sweats, palpitation, insomnia and thirst.", "The current review is carried out on triterpenoids from the Schisandraceae family, aiming to comprehensively summarize their phytochemistry, pharmacology and synthesis and provide new insights to the chemical and pharmacological study and rational utilization on medicinal plants of the Schisandarceae family.", "The information was searched from the scientific literature published from June 2014 to November 2021 on the online databases (including PubMed, CNKI, Elsevier, SciFinder and Web of Science) and other bibliography (e.g. the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, 2020 edition, Chinese herbal books). The scientific literature related to phytochemistry, pharmacology, biological activites and synthesis of triterpenoids from the Schisandraceae family was gathered.", "From June 2014 to November 2021, there were approximately 211 novel triterpenoids isolated and identified from 18 species of the Schisandraceae family. These compounds exhibit tremendous diversity in their structures, and some of them possess promising pharmacological activities, including anti-viral, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, immunosuppressive activities and neuroprotective effects. In the attempt to synthesize active compounds, the total synthesis of 13 schinortriterpenoids belonging to five structural types was successfully completed.", "Studies of triterpenoids from the Schisandraceae family are well documented in this review (from June 2014 to November 2021), and it is also well acknowledged that they are valuable resources with medicinal efficacy. However, relevant pharmacological studies are limited to in vitro tests, and data from in vivo studies and toxicology are lacking or unavailable. Fortunately, there is growing interest in the synthesis of active compounds, which should serve as an approach for accessing active compounds to develop in vivo or toxicity studies, with a view of clarifying their in vitro and vivo mechanisms for more effective and safe natural drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
