Oral glucose tolerance test using 50 g of glucose load was also performed on each subject. Both the mean peak level in blood glucose and the mean area under the glucose curve of the subjects who took boiled cocoyam, roasted yam, glucose and boiled plantains were high, whilst those who took boiled beans and garri were low. The results suggest that there are differences in blood glucose responses to equivalent amounts of different Nigerian carbohydrate loads. The mechanism for these differences is not clear. However the findings have obvious importance in formulating rational dietary or therapeutic goals for patients in whom carbohydrate restriction or lowering of blood glucose is necessary. The types of carbohydrates to be used should be specified and the method of preparation of the food should be taken into consideration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oli", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ikeakor", "ForeName": "I P", "Initials": "IP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Onwuameze", "ForeName": "I C", "Initials": "IC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Trop Geogr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0376231", "ISSNLinking": "0041-3232"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet, Diabetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucose Tolerance Test"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7168000"]}}]}
