Meyer with Agrobacterium rhizogenes A4. The established hairy root lines displayed three morphological phenotypes when cultured on hormone-free liquid Schenk and Hildebrandt medium. Most of the cultures showed the characteristic traits of hairy roots (HR-M), while others were either callus-like (C-M) or thin (T-M) without branching. The growth rate of the transformed root lines was always higher than that of untransformed roots, showing that the genetic changes caused by the A. rhizogenes transformation conditioned a higher biomass formation. When considering the different transformed root phenotypes, we can observe that the highest ginsenoside production was achieved by HR-M root lines, closely followed by C-M ones, whereas the lowest yield was reached by T-M root phenotype. The study of the integration of the TL-DNA and TR-DNA fragments of the pRiA4 in the root genome showed that the aux1 gene was always detected in HR-M and C-M root phenotypes which presented the highest biomass and ginsenoside productions. This fact suggests a significant role of aux genes in the morphology of Panax ginseng transformed roots. The ginsenoside pattern of transformed roots varied according to their morphology, although the ginsenoside contents of the Rg group was always higher than that of the Rb group. From our results, we can infer the potential of some root phenotypes of Panax ginseng hairy root cultures for an improved ginsenoside production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Secci\u00f3n de Fisiolog\u00eda Vegetal, Facultad e Farmacia, Universidad de Barcelona, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mallol", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cusid\u00f3", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Palaz\u00f3n", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bonfill", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morales", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pi\u00f1ol", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11393515", "10.1016/s0031-9422(01)00062-0", "S0031-9422(01)00062-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
