Generally classified as neglected tropical diseases, malaria and trypanosomiases are some of the most prominent parasitic diseases that cause significant loss of life annually. In 2020, an estimated 241 million malaria cases were reported, with 627,000 deaths worldwide. An estimated 6 to 7 million people are infected with <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> worldwide, whereas an estimated 1000 global cases of African human trypanosomiasis were reported in 2020. Flavanones are a group of compounds that belong to the flavonoid family and are chemically obtained by direct cyclization of chalcones. Recent pharmacological studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of plant flavanones in inhibiting the growth of the parasites responsible for malaria and trypanosomiases. The present work aims to summarize up-to-date and comprehensive literature information on plant flavanones with antimalarial and antitrypanosomal activities. The mechanisms of action of the antiparasitic flavanones are also discussed. A literature search was performed for naturally occurring flavanones and antimalarial and antitrypanosomal activities by referencing textbooks and scientific databases (SciFinder, Wiley, American Chemical Society, Science Direct, National Library of Medicine, Scientific Electronic Library Online, Web of Science, <i>etc.</i>) from their inception until April 2022. Based on <i>in vitro</i> experiments, more than sixty flavanones were reported to exhibit antimalarial, anti-<i>T. cruzi</i>, and anti-<i>T. brucei</i> activities. Previous studies demonstrated that these compounds bind to PGP-like transporters of P. falciparum to reverse the parasite's resistance. Other reports pinpointed the direct effect of these compounds on the mitochondria of the malaria parasite. Moreover, flavanones have shown strong docking to several validated <i>T. cruzi</i> and <i>T. brucei</i> protein targets, including adenosine kinase, pteridine reductase 1, dihydrofolate reductase, and trypanothione reductase, among others. Flavanones, isolated and characterized from diverse plant parts, were reported to exhibit moderate to high activity against P. falciparum, <i>T. cruzi</i>, and <i>T. brucei</i> in <i>in vitro</i> studies. These potentially active flavanones can be used as scaffolds for the development of new antiparasitic agents. However, more studies on the cytotoxicity, pharmacokinetics, and mechanisms of action of potent flavanones should be performed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4982-0507"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Phytobiochemistry and Medicinal Plants Study, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaound\u00e9 1; P.O.
