Nanwuweizi and Wuweizi are faced with problems such as confused distribution of producing areas,unclear source plants and efficacy characteristics,which limit modern resource development and application. Based on ancient literatures of materia medica,this study conducted a systematic review from several aspects,i.e. the name,distribution of producing areas,source plants,efficacy characteristics and processing of the two medicines in ancient time. This study clarified five main aspects,as following,ancient production areas and corresponding modern distribution areas; source plants used for medicinal purposes in ancient time; application period and application scope; efficacy characteristics in clinical application;processing method. This study provides a reference for evaluating the quality and for their clinical application and reasonable development of Nanwuweizi and Wuweizi."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine,Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hui-Juan", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine,Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193,China."}], "LastName": "Che", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine,Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193,China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Xue-Ping", "Initials": "XP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine,Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193,China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Yao-Dong", "Initials": "YD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou Baiyunshanzhongyi Pharmaceutical Company Limited Guangzhou 510530,China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Zhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine,Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hai-Tao", "Initials": "HT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine,Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193,China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ben-Gang", "Initials": "BG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Schisandra"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31872745", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190701.111"]}}]}
