With its root and rhizome as an important herb material, it has been applied in China for several thousand years. Traditional Chinese medicine reported that this plant had been used for relieving cough and asthma, eliminating rheumatic aches, alleviating pain and improving blood circulation. Modern pharmacology studies have confirmed that saponins, the major active compounds in this herb, have shown various pharmacological actions including anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory,lipid-lowering, anti-fungal and anti-virus activities. Therefore, the studies on saponins from D. nipponica are valuable and promising. In this present research, the pharmacological actions, therapeutic effects and mechanism of saponins from D. nipponica were summarized in order to provide the theoretical basis for the further research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrinology Department of the First Affiliated Hospital, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116011, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrinology Department of the First Affiliated Hospital, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116011, China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Jian-Ling", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dioscorea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29493133", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20171010.004"]}}]}
