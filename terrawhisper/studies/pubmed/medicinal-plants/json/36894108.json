All parts of this plant, especially the root, contain galbanum. Galbanum, the oleo-gum resin of F. gummosa, is one of the essential traditional herbal medicines in Iran, which is used as a tonic for epilepsy and chorea, memory enhancement, gastrointestinal diseases, and wound healing.", "We investigated the toxicity, anticonvulsant effects, and molecular modeling of the essential oil (EO) distilled from the oleo-gum resin of F. gummosa.", "Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to identify the EO components. The cytotoxicity of EO on HepG2 cell lines was assessed by the MTT method. Male mice were arranged as follows: negative control groups (sunflower oil (10\u00a0ml/kg, i.p.) or saline (10\u00a0ml/kg, p.o.)), EO groups (0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2.5\u00a0ml/kg, p.o.), and positive control groups (ethosuximide (150\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.) or diazepam (1.0 or 2\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.)). The motor coordination and neurotoxicity of EO were studied using the rota-rod test. Open-field, novel object recognition, and passive avoidance learning tests were used to investigate the effect of EO on locomotor activity and memory function. An acute pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure model was utilized to evaluate the anticonvulsant properties of the EO. The interaction of the EO main components with the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor was investigated by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations.", "\u03b2-pinene, sabinene, \u03b1-pinene, and \u03c1-cymene were the main components of EO. The IC<sub>50</sub> of the EO at 24, 48, and 72\u00a0h was found to be 59.90, 12.96, and 3.93\u00a0\u03bcl/ml, respectively. No adverse effects were observed in memory, motor coordination, and locomotor activity in mice treated with EO. Administration of EO (1, 1.5, and 2.5\u00a0ml/kg) improved survival rates in mice receiving pentylenetetrazole (PTZ; to induce an epileptic seizure). Sabinene was able to bind to the binding site of benzodiazepines at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor.", "Acute treatment with the EO of F. gummosa caused antiepileptic effects and could effectively increase the survival rate in PTZ-treated mice with no significant toxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
