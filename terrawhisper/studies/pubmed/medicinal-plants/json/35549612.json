The biological activities <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> showed that compounds <b>5a</b>, <b>5d</b>, <b>5e</b>, <b>5f</b>, and <b>5h</b> indicated significantly selective MAO-B inhibitory potency (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.32, 0.56, 0.54, 0.73, and 0.86\u2009\u03bcM, respectively) and moderate antioxidant activity. Moreover, compounds <b>5a</b>, <b>5d</b>, <b>5e</b>, <b>5f</b>, and <b>5h</b> showed potent anti-inflammatory properties, remarkable effects on self-induced A<i>\u03b2</i><sub>1-42</sub> aggregation, and potent neuroprotective effect on A<i>\u03b2</i><sub>1-42</sub>-induced PC12 cell injury.
