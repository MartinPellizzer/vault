Ginkgo biloba contains significant amounts of bioflavonoid 'bilobetin'. Bilobetin is an active phytochemical used for the treatment of human health complications due to its medicinal properties and therapeutic benefit. The purpose of this work is to collect and reviewed scientific data on bilobetin from different literature sources; highlight their biological properties, pharmacological activities and analytical aspects.", "Health beneficial aspects of bilobetin have been investigated in the present work through scientific data analysis. PubMed, Google Scholar, Google, Scopus, etc. have been searched in the present work in order to collect scientific information on bilobetin. Medicinal importance and therapeutic benefit of bilobetin has been searched in the present work through these databases of bilobetin. Detailed pharmacological activities of bilobetin have been reviewed in the present work through literature data analysis of various scientific research works. However, analytical data of bilobetin were also collected and reviewed in the present reaserch.", "Literature data analysis of bilobetin in the present work revealed the medicinal properties and therapeutic potential of bilobetin mainly due to its anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, antihyperlipidemic, and anti-proliferative activities. Literature data analysis revealed the effectiveness of bilobetin on osteoporosis, glucose metabolism, adipocytes, SARS CoV-2, Influenza A virus and human thrombin.
