This interaction deactivates the digestive enzymes; therefore, tannins are considered as plant defense substances. The health benefits of tannins and related polyphenols in foods and beverages have been demonstrated by biological and epidemiological studies; however, their metabolism in living plants and the chemical changes observed during processing of foods and medicinal herbs raises some questions. This review summarizes our studies concerning dynamic changes observed in tannins. Ellagitannins present in the young leaves of Camellia japonica and Quercus glauca undergo oxidative degradation as the leaves mature. Similar oxidative degradation is also observed in whiskey when it is kept for aging in oak barrels, and in decaying wood caused by fungi in natural forests. In contrast, ellagitannins have been observed to undergo reduction in the leaves of Carpinus, Castanopsis, and Triadica species as the leaves mature. This phenomenon of reductive metabolism in leaves enabled us to propose a new biosynthetic pathway for the most fundamental ellagitannin acyl groups, which was also supported by biomimetic synthetic studies. Polyphenols undergo dynamic changes during the process of food processing. Catechin in tea leaves undergo oxidation upon mechanical crushing to generate black tea polyphenols. Though detailed production mechanisms of catechin dimers have been elucidated, structures of thearubigins (TRs), which are complex mixtures of oligomers, remain ambiguous. Our recent studies suggested that catechin B-ring quinones couple with catechin A-rings during the process of oligomerization."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biomedical Sciences (Pharmaceutical Sciences), Nagasaki University."}], "LastName": "Tanaka", "ForeName": "Takashi", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8R1V1STN48", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tea"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catechin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38296496", "10.1248/yakushi.23-00170"]}}]}
