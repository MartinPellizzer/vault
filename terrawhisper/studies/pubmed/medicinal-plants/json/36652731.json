However, clinically satisfactory agents for treatment are still currently lacking. Therefore, finding neuroprotective agents with minimum side effects and better efficacy is a challenge. Chinese herbal medicine, particularly natural preparations extracted from herbs or plants, has become an unparalleled resource for discovering new agent candidates. Astragali Radix is an important Qi tonic drug in traditional Chinese medicine and has a long medicinal history. As a natural medicine, it has a good prevention and treatment effect on neurological disorders. Here, the role and mechanism of astragaloside IV in the treatment of neurological disorders were evaluated and discussed through previous research results. Related information from major scientific databases, such as PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Embase, BIOSIS Previews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Library, covering between 2001 and 2021 was compiled, using \"Astragaloside IV\" and \"Neurological disorders,\" \"Astragaloside IV,\" and \"Neurodegenerative diseases\" as reference terms. By summarizing previous research results, we found that astragaloside IV may play a neuroprotective role through various mechanisms: anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic protection of nerve cells and regulation of nerve growth factor, as well as by inhibiting neurodegeneration and promoting nerve regeneration. Astragaloside IV is a promising natural neuroprotective agent. By determining its pharmacological mechanism, astragaloside IV may be a new candidate drug for the treatment of neurological disorders."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
