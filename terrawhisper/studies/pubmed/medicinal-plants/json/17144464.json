Three clones of hairy roots were cultured. DH7a was induced by R1601, DH5a and DH5c were induced by LBA9402. DH7a grew faster than DH5a and DH5c, and all of them grew faster obviously than normal root (NOR). There were significant differences in anthraquinone composition and content among four kinds of roots. Emodin physcion and chrysophanol were predominant anthraquinone in DH5a, DH5c and NOR respectivly.
