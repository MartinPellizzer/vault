For this study, 11 representative resources of B. striata were analyzed, and the BSP contents of the different samples were significantly different; however, the monosaccharide composition of BSP was glucose and mannose. The representative samples were selected to observe their life history in situ, which were then divided and cultured in a greenhouse. Finally, samples from various organs of different plants were combined for transcriptome sequencing using the Illumina system. Our results summarized the BSP metabolic pathway, and we found that there were eight enzyme genes involved in biosynthesis, but these genes showed tissue specificity. Following qRT-PCR validation and comparative analysis, manA showed the highest expression; however, there were significant differences between the two germplasm resources in which the BSP content was significantly different, while UGP2, GPI, PMM, and GMPP had significant differences between the two samples. In summary, this study lays the foundation for further research into BSP metabolism and other physiological processes at the molecular level."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Normal University, College of Life Sciences, Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Junfeng", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Normal University, College of Life Sciences, Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Guangming", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Normal University, College of Life Sciences, Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Mi", "ForeName": "Zeyuan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Normal University, College of Life Sciences, Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Lijun", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Normal University, College of Life Sciences, Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Shuai", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Normal University, College of Life Sciences, Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shiqiang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Normal University, College of Life Sciences, Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Donghao", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6111-1551"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Normal University, College of Life Sciences, Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhezhi", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Genet Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "100883590", "ISSNLinking": "1415-4757"}, "CoiStatement": "\n<b>Conflict of Interest</b>\n.
