With decreasing temperature, an increase in the fluorescence yield at both 685 and 735 nm was observed. A marked change occurred at the longer emission band resulting in a decrease in the Chl fluorescence ratio, F685/F735, with reducing T. Our fluorescence analysis suggests that this effect is due to a temperature-induced state 1-state 2 transition that decreases and increases photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) fluorescence, respectively. Time-resolved fluorescence life-time measurements support this interpretation. At a critical temperature (about 6 degrees C) and low light intensity a sudden decrease in fluorescence intensity was observed, with a larger effect at 685 than at 735 nm. This is probably linked to a modification of the thylakoid membranes, induced by chilling temperatures, which can alter the spill-over from PSII to PSI. The contribution of photosystem I to the long-wavelength Chl fluorescence band (735 nm) at room temperature was estimated by both time-resolved fluorescence lifetime and fluorescence yield measurements at 685 and 735 nm. We found that PSI contributes to the 735 nm fluorescence for about 40, 10 and 35% at the minimal (F0), maximal (Fm) and steady-state (Fs) levels, respectively. Therefore, PSI must be taken into account in the analysis of Chl fluorescence parameters that include the 735 nm band and to interpret the changes in the Chl fluorescence ratio that can be induced by different agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Istituto di Elettronica Quantistica-CNR, Sezione INFM di Firenze, Florence, Italy. agati@ieq.fi.cnr.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agati", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cerovic", "ForeName": "Z G", "Initials": "ZG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moya", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosystem I Protein Complex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosystem II Protein Complex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cold Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pisum sativum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosystem I Protein Complex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosystem II Protein Complex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10911731", "10.1562/0031-8655(2000)072<0075:teodtu>2.0.co;2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
