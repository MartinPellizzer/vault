Population densities of Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz & Neiva) sandflies were higher in beans and maize crops than in the surrounding open and tree scrub. Significant relationships were detected between the abundances of sandflies and aphids, suggesting aphid honeydew as a potential food source. Sugar meal analysis, using high-performance anion exchange (HPAE) chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) and the cold anthrone test, was used to demonstrate that significantly more sandflies fed on bean plants contaminated with aphids and honeydew than on uncontaminated beans. Furthermore, higher concentrations of sugars were detected in flies which fed on aphid/honeydew-contaminated beans, suggesting that sugar was more easily available and/or that honeydew/aphids act as phagostimulants for sandflies. Amongst wild sandflies collected from a bean field, significantly more female sandflies were 'sugar-positive' than males, though the sugar concentrations in positive sandflies were similar for both sexes. The concentrations of di- and trisaccharides in sandfly homogenates, honeydew extracts and phloem exudates were very low."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Parasite and Vector Biology, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, U.K."}], "LastName": "Cameron", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pessoa", "ForeName": "F A", "Initials": "FA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vasconcelos", "ForeName": "A W", "Initials": "AW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ward", "ForeName": "R D", "Initials": "RD"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Wellcome Trust", "Country": "United Kingdom"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Med Vet Entomol", "NlmUniqueID": "8708682", "ISSNLinking": "0269-283X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Med Vet Entomol 1995 Oct;9(4):376"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aphids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feeding Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Honey"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Psychodidae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7548943", "10.1111/j.1365-2915.1995.tb00132.x"]}}]}
