Several PA quantitative methodologies were developed based on a limited number of certified standards, including time consuming solid phase extraction (SPE) purification steps. Herein, we shed light on the variability of PA in herbal extracts and propose a quantification methodology based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) for the evaluation of the total PA content as retronecine-equivalents (RE) directly from crude matrices. Particularly in the focus of the investigation were Alkanna spp. (Boraginaceae), which possess a wide range of pharmaceutical properties. In addition, a comparative PA screening of crude and SPE enriched extracts was performed and PA-containing plants from Fabaceae and Compositae families were included to demonstrate universal applicability. In total, 105 PA were identified using HRMS<sup>e</sup> experiments, specific MS/MS fragmentation PA patterns, a customized in-house library and literature data. Among them, 18 glycosidic PA derivatives were reported for the first time in literature. Using a hierarchical clustering approach, PA distribution in herbal extracts was shown to be family-dependent and significantly different among species. This was further supported by the results of the total PA concentrations, obtained using a retronecine/heliotridine/internal standard-based targeted UHPLC-HRMS quantification method, which varied from 8.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08-3096.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0273.72\u00a0\u03bcg RE/g extract dry weight in shoots extracts of Alkanna spp. and leaves extracts of Crotalaria retusa L. respectively. Worth mentioning is that the procedure allowed to quantify PA in Alkanna spp. If the procedure based on 35 specific PA recommended by European regulations had been used, results would have been equal to zero for the four species since none were observed in Alkanna spp. Finally, by combining the RE results with the corresponding dereplication results, a customized correction factor for each extract (ranging from 2.12 to 2.48) was assessed leading to a more accurate estimate of the PA content regardless of the molecular weight of each PA. The present methodology will facilitate PA quantification directly from crude extracts and avoid the underestimation the real PA content due to limited availabilty of authentic reference compounds in botanical extracts used in phytomedicines or food supplements/cosmetics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
