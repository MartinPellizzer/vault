Considering the limited understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that affect the growth and bioactivity of the medicinal plant Nepeta nuda (Lamiaceae), our study aimed to explore how cytokinins influence the plant's metabolic status. Exogenous administration of active cytokinin forms on in vitro N. nuda internodes stimulated intensive callus formation and de novo shoot regeneration, leading to a marked increase in biomass. This process involved an accumulation of oxidants, which were scavenged by peroxidases using phenolics as substrates. The callus tissue formed upon the addition of the cytokinin 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) acted as a sink for sugars and phenolics during the allocation of nutrients between the culture medium and regenerated plants. In accordance, the cytokinin significantly enhanced the content of polar metabolites and their respective in vitro biological activities compared to untreated in vitro and wild-grown plants. The BAP-mediated accumulation of major phenolic metabolites, rosmarinic acid (RA) and caffeic acid (CA), corresponded with variations in the expression levels of genes involved in their biosynthesis. In contrast, the accumulation of iridoids and the expression of corresponding biosynthetic genes were not significantly affected. In conclusion, our study elucidated the mechanism of cytokinin action in N. nuda in vitro culture and demonstrated its potential in stimulating the production of bioactive compounds. This knowledge could serve as a basis for further investigations of the environmental impact on plant productivity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
