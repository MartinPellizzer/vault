In addition, the in-vivo preliminary anti-oedematogenic actions of the oil and some fractions of it were assessed against carrageenan- and bradykinin-induced oedema formation in the rat paw. Twenty-seven sesquiterpenes and six diterpenes were identified, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-copaene and copalic acid being the main components. The dichloromethanic and methanolic fractions obtained from C. multijuga oil given by the intraperitoneal route caused a significant inhibition of paw oedema caused by carrageenan with inhibition of 49 +/- 13% and 64 +/- 9 %, respectively. Likewise, dexamethasone (the positive control drug) also greatly inhibited carrageenan-induced paw oedema formation (60 +/- 4% at 2 h). The hexanic fraction also significantly inhibited (50 +/- 6%) the paw oedema formation caused by bradykinin. These results suggest the presence of still non-identified active terpene compounds in the oil of C. multijuga that exhibit anti-oedematogenic properties. Of note, the yield of these compounds and the pharmacological actions of the oil, exhibited great seasonal variations, a relevant aspect that should be carefully observed for the correct medicinal use of this plant by the population."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica, Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Exatas, Universidade Federal do Amazonas, 69077-000, Manaus, AM, Brazil. valdirveiga@ufam.edu.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Veiga Junior", "ForeName": "Valdir F", "Initials": "VF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zunino", "ForeName": "Luciano", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Patitucci", "ForeName": "Maria L\u00facia", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pinto", "ForeName": "Angelo C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Calixto", "ForeName": "Jo\u00e3o B", "Initials": "JB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hindlimb"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17034665", "10.1211/jpp.58.11.0015"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
