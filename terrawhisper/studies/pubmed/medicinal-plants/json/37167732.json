Antileishmanial metal complexes, like Glucantime\u00ae<sup>\ufe0f</sup> with proven activity, are routinely studied to probe their potency. We investigated the effects of a Cu (II) homoleptic complex coordinated by two dimethyl-bipyridine ligands against Leishmania major stages in silico and in vitro. The affinity of this heterocyclic Cu (II) complex (CuDMBP) towards a parasitic metacaspase was studied by molecular docking. Key pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the complex were predicted using three web-based tools. CuDMBP was tested for in vitro antileishmanial activities using MTT assay, model murine macrophages, flow cytometry, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Molecular docking confirmed the tendency between the target macromolecule and the complex. ADMET evaluations highlighted CuDMBP's key pharmacological features, including P-glycoprotein-associated GI absorption and lack of trans-BBB permeability. MTT showed significant inhibitory effects against promastigotes. CuDMBP significantly increased the level of cellular IL-12 expression (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while the upregulation observed in the expression of iNOS was considered not significant (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). It decreased the expression of IL-10 significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Findings demonstrated that CuDMBP deserves to be introduced as a leishmanicidal candidate provided further studies are carried out."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
