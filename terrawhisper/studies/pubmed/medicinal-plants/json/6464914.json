TJ-7 was administered in 7.5 g doses three times a day for 4 months to 23 patients with oligozoospermia and 20 patients with asthenozoospermia. Sperm count was improved in 5 of the patients (21%) with oligozoospermia and sperm motility was improved in 10 of the patients (50%) with asthenozoospermia. TJ-32 was administered in 5.1 g doses three times a day for 4 months to 26 patients with oligozoospermia and 20 of the patients with asthenozoospermia. Sperm count was improved in 8 of the patients (31%) with oligozoospermia and sperm motility was improved in 9 of the patients (45%) with asthenozoospermia. Both TJ-7 and TJ-32 were more effective in sperm count and motility than clomiphene citrate. No side effects or abnormal laboratory data including serum LH, FSH, testosterone, estradiol and prolactin were observed in any cases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Okuyama", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Namiki", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sonoda", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hayashi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Hinyokika Kiyo", "NlmUniqueID": "0421145", "ISSNLinking": "0018-1994"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Infertility, Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sperm Motility"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6464914"]}}]}
