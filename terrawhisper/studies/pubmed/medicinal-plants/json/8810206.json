In both dry eye syndrome and ocular asthenia the herbal eye drop preparation was found better than placebo. In a few cases of cataract, the vision seems to be improved. In early myopia it seems to correct the refractive errors while in high myopic conditions it controlled the progressive deteriorations. Subjective improvements were also noted with hypermetropia, presbyopia and astigmatism. Its healing capacity in allergic conjunctivitis was certainly better than placebo. It had no short term or long term side-effects. It is considered to be a useful drug in all conditions studied."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dr RP Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, AIIMS, New Delhi."}], "LastName": "Biswas", "ForeName": "N R", "Initials": "NR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Beri", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "G K", "Initials": "GK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mongre", "ForeName": "P K", "Initials": "PK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Multicenter Study", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Indian Med Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "7505608", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5847"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Eye Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8810206"]}}]}
