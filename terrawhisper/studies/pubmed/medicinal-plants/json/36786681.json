Confusoside (CF) is the most abundant dihydrochalcone in <i>A. fragrans</i> leaves, which is traditionally used in the treatment of liver diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of CF on acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatic injury in mice. CF could reduce the levels of AST, ALT, and LDH in the serum and enhance the antioxidant activity by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway to increase the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and CAT), and the GSH content but decrease the MDA accumulation in liver tissues. Immunofluorescence assay and western blotting analysis showed that CF can regulate Nrf2 into the cell nucleus, thereby promoting the expression of downstream antioxidant-related proteins, including NQO1 and HO-1. In addition, CF could inhibit the liver inflammatory response by suppressing the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway to reduce the expressions of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and NO. Molecular docking results showed that there was good binding between the CF and Keap1-Nrf2 protein. Western blotting and TUNEL analysis also revealed CF-inhibited cell apoptosis-related protein expression (Bcl2 and caspase-3/9 proteins). Thus, the CF from <i>A. fragrans</i> leaves could be served as an alternative hepaprotective agent for the treatment and prevention of APAP-induced liver injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chemistry in Ethnic Medicinal Resources, State Ethnic Affairs Commission and Ministry of Education, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, China. wangyudan@ymu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jinghao", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chemistry in Ethnic Medicinal Resources, State Ethnic Affairs Commission and Ministry of Education, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, China. wangyudan@ymu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Shang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The faculty of Food Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, China. ggcheng@kust.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiaoyu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The faculty of Food Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, China. ggcheng@kust.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yaping", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chemistry in Ethnic Medicinal Resources, State Ethnic Affairs Commission and Ministry of Education, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, China. wangyudan@ymu.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Environment, National and Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Green Preparation Technology of Biobased Materials, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Minglong", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The faculty of Food Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, China. ggcheng@kust.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Guiguang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8072-7944"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chemistry in Ethnic Medicinal Resources, State Ethnic Affairs Commission and Ministry of Education, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, China. wangyudan@ymu.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Environment, National and Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Green Preparation Technology of Biobased Materials, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yudan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Funct", "NlmUniqueID": "101549033", "ISSNLinking": "2042-6496"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "362O9ITL9D", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetaminophen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H5W525SX7Q", "NameOfSubstance": "dihydrochalcone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-E2-Related Factor 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Acetaminophen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-E2-Related Factor 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36786681", "10.1039/d2fo03497b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
