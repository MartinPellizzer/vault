(Rosaceae) is a plant traditionally used in Brazil and some other countries to treat diarrhea, stomach diseases, and as an analgesic, antimicrobial, antihypertensive, and as well as other pharmacological properties. The aim of this study was to examine cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of <i>R. rosifolius</i> leaves extract on HepG2/C3A cells and correlate these findings with the expression of mRNA to underlying mechanisms of action. At concentrations between 0.01 and 100\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, cytotoxic effects were not detected by the MTT assay. This was confirmed by mRNA induction of the <i>CYP3A4</i> gene (by RT-qPCR assay). However, genotoxic effects occurred at treatments from 1\u00a0\u00b5g/ml extract (comet and micronucleus test). An increase in the number of cells in S phase was observed at 100\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, and an elevation in apoptotic cell number was found for all tested concentrations (10, 20, or 100\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) (cell cycle and apoptosis analysis by flow cytometry). The genotoxicity induced by the extract was the main cause of the rise in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis, as indicated by rise in mRNA of <i>CASP7</i> gene, and elevation of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle at the higher tested concentrations, as an attempt to repair genetic damage that occurred. These observations suggest that, despite its pharmacological potential, the use of <i>R. rosifolius</i> leaves extract may pose a risk to the integrity of the genetic material of human cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Post-Graduate Program on General and Applied Biology, S\u00e3o Paulo State University - UNESP - Biosciences Institute , Botucatu, SP, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Biomedicina, Centro Universit\u00e1rio De Rio Preto - UNIRP - S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Do Rio Preto , SP, Brasil."}], "LastName": "Quadros", "ForeName": "Ana Paula Oliveira De", "Initials": "APO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marilia Medical School , Marilia, SP, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Speech and Hearing Therapy Department, S\u00e3o Paulo State University - UNESP - Faculty of Philosophy and Sciences Mar\u00edlia, SP, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Almeida", "ForeName": "La\u00edza Moura", "Initials": "LM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Vale Do Itaja\u00ed University (UNIVALI) , Itaja\u00ed, SC, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Petreanu", "ForeName": "Marcel", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Vale Do Itaja\u00ed University (UNIVALI) , Itaja\u00ed, SC, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Niero", "ForeName": "Rivaldo", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Campinas , Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Rosa", "ForeName": "Paulo Cesar Pires", "Initials": "PCP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Campinas , Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Sawaya", "ForeName": "Alexandra Christinie Helena Frankland", "Initials": "ACHF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Biology, Londrina State University , Londrina, PR, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Mantovani", "ForeName": "Mario Sergio", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CECAV and Department of Genetics and Biotechnology, University of Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes and Alto Douro , Vila Real, Portugal."}], "LastName": "Gaiv\u00e3o", "ForeName": "Isabel O'Neill De Mascarenhas", "Initials": "IOM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Post-Graduate Program on General and Applied Biology, S\u00e3o Paulo State University - UNESP - Biosciences Institute , Botucatu, SP, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marilia Medical School , Marilia, SP, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Speech and Hearing Therapy Department, S\u00e3o Paulo State University - UNESP - Faculty of Philosophy and Sciences Mar\u00edlia, SP, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Maistro", "ForeName": "Edson Luis", "Initials": "EL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "CASP7 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 7"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 7"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hep G2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Rubus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32568621", "10.1080/15287394.2020.1779888"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
