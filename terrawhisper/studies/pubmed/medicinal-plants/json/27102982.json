(Apiaceae), a perennial aromatic herb, grows wild in Iran. The aerial parts of F. angulata are used as a flavouring in foods, especially dairy foods by indigenous people in western and southwestern Iran.", "This study investigates variation in chemical compositions, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the essential oils from F. angulata collected from natural habitats in the alpine regions of southwestern Iran.", "The antimicrobial activity, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal (MBC) of the essential oils were evaluated against four bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhimurium). Antioxidant activity of the oils was determined by DPPH assay.", "The essential oils were analyzed by GC-FID and GC/MS, which 49 volatile components were identified. There were significant differences between the various populations for oil yield and some main compounds. The major constituents of the essential oils from F. angulata were \u03b1-pinene, and cis-\u03b2-ocimene. The MICs of the essential oils were within concentration ranges from 62 to 250\u2009\u03bcg/mL and the respective MBCs were 125 to\u2009>\u2009500\u2009\u03bcg/mL. Generally, the oils from F. angulata indicated weak to moderate inhibitory activities against bacteria, especially against Listeria monocytogenes. The highest antioxidant activity was obtained from the oil of the Kallar population (IC<sub>50</sub> value<sub>\u2009</sub>=<sub>\u2009</sub>488\u2009\u03bcg/mL) and BHT as positive control (IC<sub>50\u2009</sub> value =<sub>\u2009</sub>321\u2009\u03bcg/mL).", "The essential oil of F. angulata could be serving as a potential source of \u03b1-pinene and cis-\u03b2-ocimene for use in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Medicinal Plants , Research Center for Medicinal Plants & Ethno-veterinary, Shahrekord Branch, Islamic Azad University , Shahrekord , Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghasemi Pirbalouti", "ForeName": "Abdollah", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Medicinal Plants , Research Center for Medicinal Plants & Ethno-veterinary, Shahrekord Branch, Islamic Azad University , Shahrekord , Iran."}], "LastName": "Izadi", "ForeName": "Arezo", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Medicinal Plants , Research Center for Medicinal Plants & Ethno-veterinary, Shahrekord Branch, Islamic Azad University , Shahrekord , Iran."}], "LastName": "Malek Poor", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Medicinal Plants , Research Center for Medicinal Plants & Ethno-veterinary, Shahrekord Branch, Islamic Azad University , Shahrekord , Iran."}], "LastName": "Hamedi", "ForeName": "Behzad", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812552", "ISSNLinking": "1388-0209"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JPF3YI7O34", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-pinene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27102982", "10.3109/13880209.2016.1162816"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
