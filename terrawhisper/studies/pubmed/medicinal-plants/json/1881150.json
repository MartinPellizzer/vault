In spite of its further utilization in many additional illnesses such as madness, foxglove, and later its main heteroside digitoxine, progressively reached their eventual place in the treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias and in congestive heart failure. In the latter indication, however, its value is now being questioned; it is being accused of augmenting myocardial work due to its vasoconstrictor properties, of favoring dysrhythmic events in a disease already burdened with a 50% arrhythmia mortality, and actually of having a low therapeutic index. Even though being discarded by a number of cardiologists, digitoxine still remains in the appraisal of others as an indispensable medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut de Recherches cardiovasculaires, Royat, France."}], "LastName": "Marullaz", "ForeName": "P D", "Initials": "PD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Digitalis Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "73K4184T59", "NameOfSubstance": "Digoxin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["history", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Digoxin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Failure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 18th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1881150", "10.1016/0378-8741(91)90109-q", "0378-8741(91)90109-Q"]}}]}
