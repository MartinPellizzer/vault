However, the additive component was also significant for the former three traits. Dominant alleles mostly with positive effects were, by and large, asymmetrically distributed in parents except for narcotine content. Heritability estimates were moderate and corresponded with low genetic advance estimates for morphine, codeine, and thebaine contents. Ample genetic diversity among parents was reflected for all traits except narcotine content. On an overall basis, heterosis breeding was suggested to be a rewarding proposition for genetic improvement of the opium poppy ( PAPAVER SOMNIFERUM L.)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow - 226 016, India."}], "LastName": "Lal", "ForeName": "R K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17226158", "10.1055/s-2006-960088"]}}]}
