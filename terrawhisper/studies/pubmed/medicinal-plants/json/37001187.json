Synthesis of secondary metabolites by the plant is one of the adaptive mechanisms against stress to provide resistance. Among several secondary metabolites, flavonols, a subgroup of flavonoids, are one of the most widely distributed in the plant kingdom. These molecules work as antioxidants, reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants, and cause detrimental effects on insect growth on feeding. Despite the great interest in flavonol function leading to insect tolerance and stress response, the detailed mechanisms related to these specific functions have yet to be studied. In this review, we have summarized the role of flavonols in plant defense against insects and different abiotic stresses and possible mechanisms involved in these functions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
