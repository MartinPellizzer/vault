We have also assessed some of the mechanisms underlying the antinociceptive effect of the extract. The hydroalcoholic extract of S. verticillatus (60-1000 mg kg-1, i.p. or p.o.) produced dose-related, significant and long-lasting (6 to 8 h) inhibition of acetic acid-induced abdominal constriction in mice, with ID50 values of 204 and approximately 1000 mg kg-1, respectively. In the formalin test, the extract (100-1000 mg kg-1), given either intraperitoneally or orally, resulted in graded inhibition of both phases of formalin-induced pain, being about 2- to 4-fold more potent in attenuating the second phase of the pain. The calculated mean ID50 (mg kg-1) values for the earlier and the later phases were: 491 and 186 and 640 and 441, respectively. In addition, the extract (60-1000 mg kg-1, i.p. or p.o.) caused marked and dose-related inhibition of capsaicin-induced neurogenic pain with mean ID50 values of 420 and 485 mg kg-1, respectively. The hydroalcoholic extract, at the same doses, did not significantly affect the performance of animals in the rota-rod test, nor did it have any analgesic effect in the tail-flick or hot-plate tests. The treatment of animals with naloxone (5 mg kg-1, s.c.) significantly reversed the analgesic effect of both morphine (5 mg kg-1, s.c.) and the extract (300 mg kg-1, i.p.) when assessed against acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions. The treatment of animals with L-arginine (600 mg kg-1, i.p.) significantly attenuated the antinociceptive effects of NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG) (75 mg kg-1, i.p.), of the hydroalcoholic extract (600 mg kg-1, i.p.) or of morphine (5 mg kg-1, s.c.), when analysed against the formalin test. In addition, adrenalectomy of animals 7 days before the tests significantly reversed the antinociception caused by the hydroalcoholic extract (300 mg kg-1, i.p.) in the formalin-induced pain. These data show that the hydroalcoholic extract of S. verticillatus has significant and long-lasting oral antinociception when assessed against both neurogenic and inflammatory models of nociception in mice. The precise mechanism responsible for the analgesic effect of the extract still remains unclear, but a great part of this effect seems to be partly related to an opioid-like action and involvement of the L-arginine-nitric oxide pathway. Finally, the antinociception caused by the hydroalcoholic extract of S. verticillatus is modulated by adrenal hormones."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Trentin", "ForeName": "A P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Santos", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miguel", "ForeName": "O G", "Initials": "OG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pizzolatti", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yunes", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Calixto", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nociceptors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9178196", "10.1111/j.2042-7158.1997.tb06843.x"]}}]}
