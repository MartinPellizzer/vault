Expression of IL-1beta and c-fos were determined by immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus regions in brain tissue at the 0.5 h-7 d after reperfusion. CGE was diluted by CMC and poured into the stomach by 0.7 mL x (100 g)(-1) with a high dosage (19.34 x 10(3) g x L(-1) row herbs), a middle dosage (9.67 x 10(3) g x L(-1)), a low dosage (4.83 x 10(3) g x L(-1)). There were an IL-1ra (rhIL-1ra 20 microg injected into the left cerebral ventricle), a sham operation (NaCl 20 microL injected into the left cerebral ventricle) and a model as control.", "Compared with control group, three dose groups (low, middle and high) in CGE showed significant inhibiting effects on the expression of c-fos protein at 2, 3, 4, 12 hours and 3 day following cerebral ischaemic-reperfusion. The level of the inhibiting effects in small and middle groups were lower at all time points than that in IL-1ra group (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01). CGE inhibited the expression of hippocampus IL-1beta protein, taking effect from the 2 h after reperfusion. Both HD group (531 +/- 151.1) and MD group (589.3 +/- 78.6) showed more obvious effect which lasted until the 72 h compared with the model group (687.6 +/- 116.7) (P < 0.01 and 0.05). Large dose group (81.3 +/- 16.1) showed the same level of the inhibiting effect on expression of c-fos protein as IL-1ra group (67.2 +/- 25.7) from 4 hour on following cerebral ischaemic reperfusion (P > 0.05).", "CGE with function of Yiqi Bushen, Huoxue Huatan has effect of inhibiting up-regulated expression of IL-1beta and c-fos protein following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. However, this effect of CGE starts relatively later than that of IL-1ra. The effect of CGE is associated with its dosage, i.e. a larger dosage has a better effect on expression of c-fos protein in post-stroke dementia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Care of Elderly, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Jin-zhou", "Initials": "JZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Ai-hua", "Initials": "AH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Jun-xiang", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Jia-you", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong-yan", "Initials": "YY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cistanche"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hippocampus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15706927"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
