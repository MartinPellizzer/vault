Distance metastasis to other tissues, high toxicity, and drug resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy demand novel therapeutic approaches to treat cancer. Natural compounds from medicinal plants have been studied for therapeutic use in various malignancies. Nimbolide is an active principal compound from Azadirachta indica, which is an Asian traditional medicinal plant utilized historically as a remedy for a variety of diseases due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and antimicrobial properties. It is a limonoid triterpene possessing potent anti-cancer effects in various types of cancers. It has been reported to induce multiple cytotoxic effects in tumor cells by modulating the cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and metastasis by altering the various molecular signaling pathways. In the present review, we summarized all the in vitro and in vivo studies reporting the molecular targets of nimbolide for the therapeutic approaches in different types of cancer cells. We analyzed research publications up to September 2021 on the effect of nimbolide in various malignancies and the molecular mechanism of action. Nimbolide targets different signaling pathways including epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin like growth factor (IGF), Wingless and INT-1 (Wnt)/\u03b2-catenin, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03ba\u03b2), and death receptor 5 (DR5) in several cancer cells. Nimbolide's widespread availability and absence of side effects, as well as understanding the molecular mechanism of nimbolide's action, will be useful to develop a therapeutic agent against cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Cancer Genomics, Saveetha Dental College and Hospital, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Elumalai", "ForeName": "Perumal", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Molecular Medicine and Toxicology Division, Saveetha Dental College and Hospital, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences (SIMATS), Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Ezhilarasan", "ForeName": "Devaraj", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Cancer and Stem Cell Lab, Saveetha Dental College and Hospital, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences (SIMATS), Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Raghunandhakumar", "ForeName": "Subramanian", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "8501420", "ISSNLinking": "0731-8898"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Limonins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "25990-37-8", "NameOfSubstance": "nimbolide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Limonins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "23"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35695653", "10.1615/JEnvironPatholToxicolOncol.2021040263", "5ba9bad964993800,2ccec8f74e26bda1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
