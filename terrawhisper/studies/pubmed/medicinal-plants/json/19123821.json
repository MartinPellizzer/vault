Vegetable oil is one of the most studied foods because of its nutritional and medicinal properties in a correct diet. In this study, a total of 53 Camelina sativa samples, from all known growing areas, were chemically and isotopically characterized. The fatty acid content of camelina oil was determined by gas chromatography (GC), and the ratios of stable carbon isotopes ((13)C/(12)C) of individual fatty acids and seed/bulk oil were determined by gas chromatography-combustion-stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS) and elemental analysis-stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). A total of 17 different fatty acids were detected by GC, with omega3 R-linolenic acid (C(18:3n3)) being the most abundant (29.7-40.0 wt %). Oleic acid (C(18:1n9)), linoleic acid (C(18:2n6)) and eicosenoic acid (C(20:1n9)) all belong to the second group of major fatty acids. The stable carbon isotopic values (delta(13)C) fell into a range typical for C(3) plants. The use of delta(13)C(18:2n6) vs delta(13)C(18:3n3) correlation could show cases where impurity or adulteration is suspected, whereas principal component analysis clearly separates oil samples from different continents. Preliminary results on the camelina oil authentication procedure provide a basis for the investigation of geographical origin and the further distinction between camelina and camelina refined or other, less expensive oils."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Slovenian Institute of Hop Research and Brewing, Zalec, Slovenia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hrastar", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Petrisic", "ForeName": "Marinka G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ogrinc", "ForeName": "Nives", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kosir", "ForeName": "Iztok Joze", "Initials": "IJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Isotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Brassicaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19123821", "10.1021/jf8028144", "10.1021/jf8028144"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
