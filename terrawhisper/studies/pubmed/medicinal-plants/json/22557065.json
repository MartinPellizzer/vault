(wild turmeric or kastoorimanjal of commerce rhizome is used as appetizer, tonic, blood purifier and cosmetic. It is useful in flatulence and dyspepsia and also for worms and skin diseases a study on the agrotechniques for its cultivation at the aromatic and Medicinal plants Research Station, Odakkali during 1996-1999 revealed that it is highly adaptable to a wide range of spacings, producing similar yields by adjusting the number of plants/hill. It produces maximum yield of rhizome (34t/ha), essential oil (0.33%) and oleoresin (5.%%) when 1.5 t/ha of seed rhizomes are planted at 60 \u00d740 cm spacing with the receipt of premonsoon showers in May and harvested in January. Application of 20/ha of FYM, 100:50:50 kg N:P:K/ha. Biofertilisers, green manuring and mulching maximize the yields. Combination and interaction effects of the various manorial treatments are to be studied further in detail.
