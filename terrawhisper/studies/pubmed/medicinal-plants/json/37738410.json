In the life cycle of plants, de-etiolation is essential for seedling development and plant survival. The mobilization of soluble sugars (glucose [Glc], sucrose, and fructose) derived from stored carbohydrates and lipids to target organs, including cotyledons, hypocotyls, and radicles, underpins de-etiolation. Therefore, dynamic carbohydrate biochemistry is a key feature of this phase transition. However, the molecular mechanisms coordinating carbohydrate status with the cellular machinery orchestrating de-etiolation remain largely opaque. Here, we show that the Glc sensor HEXOKINASE 1 (HXK1) interacts with GROWTH REGULATOR FACTOR5 (GRF5), a transcriptional activator and key plant growth regulator, in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Subsequently, GRF5 directly binds to the promoter of phytochrome A (phyA), encoding a far-red light (FR) sensor/cotyledon greening inhibitor. We demonstrate that the status of Glc within dark-grown etiolated cotyledons determines the de-etiolation of seedlings when exposed to light irradiation by the HXK1-GRF5-phyA molecular module. Thus, following seed germination, accumulating Glc within dark-grown etiolated cotyledons stimulates a HXK1-dependent increase of GRF5 and an associated decrease of phyA, triggering the perception, amplification, and relay of HXK1-dependent Glc signaling, thereby facilitating the de-etiolation of seedlings following light irradiation. Our findings, therefore, establish how cotyledon carbohydrate signaling under subterranean darkness is sensed, amplified, and relayed, determining the phase transition from skotomorphogenesis to photomorphogenesis on exposure to light irradiation."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 American Society of Plant Biologists 2023.
