Cinnamigone A (1), structurally artemisinin-like, is a natural 1,2,4-trioxane caged endoperoxide with an unprecedented tetracyclic 6/6/7/5 ring system. Compounds 2-3 are classic guaiane sesquiterpene featuring different epoxy units. Guaiol (4) is considered to be the precursor of 1-3 in the biosynthesis pathway hypothesis. The planar structures and configurations of cinnamigones A-C were elucidated by spectral analysis, HRESIMS, X-ray crystallography and ECD calculations. Evaluation of the neuroprotective activity of 1-3 on N-methyl-\u1d05aspartate (NMDA) toxicity was demonstrated that compounds 1-2 exhibited moderate neuroprotective activity against NMDA-induced neurotoxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
