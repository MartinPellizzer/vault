The use of conventional antifungal agents for the treatment of <i>Candida</i> is reported to be less effective and hence alternative therapies for the treatment are needed. Essential oils of medicinal plants may serve as a strong candidate for natural products in modern therapies.", "The aim of this study was to determine the synergistic potential of essential oils extracted from leaves of <i>Aegle marmelos</i> (L.) Correa and a potent antifungal agent, nystatin, against three clinical isolates of <i>C. albicans</i> using checkerboard assay.", "The antifungal activity of the essential oils of <i>A. marmelos</i> was screened against test cultures by disc diffusion technique. Antibiograms of the test organisms were developed. To determine the minimum fungicidal concentration of the essential oil and nystatin, the broth microdilution method was employed, and a checkerboard assay was used to investigate the synergistic potential of the essential oil and nystatin against the clinical isolates under study. The data were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation.", "The \u03a3 fractional inhibitory concentration values were calculated as 0.12, 0.37, and 0.28 for three different strains of <i>C. albicans</i> used, respectively, which was <0.5, therefore, the synergy was demonstrated between essential oils and nystatin against the test cultures.", "Combinatorial therapy of the essential oils extracted from the leaves of <i>A. marmelos</i> and nystatin may be considered a line of treatment for candidal infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2024 AYU (An International Quarterly Journal of Research in Ayurveda)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, SIES College of Arts, Science and Commerce, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Kamble", "ForeName": "Pramod Ananda", "Initials": "PA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, SIES College of Arts, Science and Commerce, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Phadke", "ForeName": "Manju", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Ayu", "NlmUniqueID": "7605807", "ISSNLinking": "0974-8520"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Berenguer J, Diaz-Guerra TM, Ruiz-Diez B, Bernaldo de Quiros JC, Rodriguez-Tudela JL, Martinez-Suarez JV.
