Following the observation of substantial benefit in patients receiving oral treatment with daily decoctions of traditional Chinese medicinal plants, we undertook a placebo-controlled double-blind trial of a specific prescription formulated for widespread non-exudative atopic eczema. Forty-seven children were given active treatment and placebo in random order, each for 8 weeks, with an intervening 4-week wash-out period. Thirty-seven children tolerated the treatment and completed the study. Response to active treatment was superior to response to placebo, and was clinically valuable. There was no evidence of haematological, renal or hepatic toxicity. These findings anticipate a wider therapeutic potential for traditional Chinese medicinal plants in this disease, and other skin diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Hospital for Sick Children, London, U.K."}], "LastName": "Sheehan", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Atherton", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Dermatol", "NlmUniqueID": "0004041", "ISSNLinking": "0007-0963"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis, Atopic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1536784", "10.1111/j.1365-2133.1992.tb07817.x"]}}]}
