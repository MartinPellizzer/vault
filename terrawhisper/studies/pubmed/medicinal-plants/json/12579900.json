Determination was carried out with a UV detector at 254 nm. The separations were performed at 16 degrees C with a positive voltage of 15 kV. Samples were injected into the capillary by pressure for 6 s. The biological samples (urine, bile, plasma and feces) of rats were alkalized and extracted with ethyl acetate.", "The experimental results showed that the concentration of HP-beta-CD, the concentration of the running buffer and the pH value of the buffer were the main important factors which effected the resolution. d-Securinine and l-securinine were separated at baseline level under the determination conditions. The determination was not interfered by endogenous components and metabolites. After i.p. administration, the rats excreted more d-securinine than l-securinine through bile, urine and feces. The metabolism process in rats was stereoselective.", "This method is simple, reliable and suitable for studying the stereoselective metabolism of securinine in rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao-hai", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jin-lan", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Tong-hui", "Initials": "TH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azepines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Heterocyclic Compounds, Bridged-Ring"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Piperidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G4VS580P5E", "NameOfSubstance": "securinine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Azepines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bile"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Capillary"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Euphorbiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heterocyclic Compounds, Bridged-Ring"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Lactones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Piperidines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12579900"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
