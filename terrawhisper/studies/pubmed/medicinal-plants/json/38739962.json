To cope with this situation, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) NPs were used first time to mitigate abiotic stresses caused in plant. In this study, rGO NPs were synthesized and reduced with Tecoma stans plant leave extract through modified Hummer's methods. The well prepared rGO NPs were characterized by ultra-violet visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Zeta potential, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). However, pot experiment was conducted with four different concentrations (15, 30, 60, 120\u00a0mg/L) of rGO NPs and three different concentrations (300, 500,700\u00a0mg/L) of lead (Pb) stress were applied. To observe the mitigative effects of rGO NPs, 30\u00a0mg/L of rGO NPs and 700\u00a0mg/L of Pb were used in combination. Changes in morphological and biochemical characteristics of wheat plants were observed for both Pb stress and rGO NPs treatments. Pb was found to inhibit the morphological and biochemical characteristics of plants. rGO NPs alone as well as in combination with Pb was found to increase the chlorophyll content of wheat plants. Under Pb stress conditions and rGO NPs treatments, antioxidant enzyme activities like ascorbate peroxidases (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) were observed. Current findings revealed that greenly reduced graphene oxide NPs can effectively promote growth in wheat plants under Pb stress by elevating chlorophyll content of leaves, reducing the Pb uptake, and suppressing ROS produced due to Pb toxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS.
