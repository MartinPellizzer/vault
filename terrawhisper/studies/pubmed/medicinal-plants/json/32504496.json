However, in most cases, the specific molecules or the active ingredients responsible for the medicinal or therapeutic properties are not yet known.", "This study aimed to report a computational protocol as well as a tool for generating novel potential drug candidates from the bioactive molecules of Indian medicinal and aromatic plants through the chemoinformatics approach.", "We built a database of the Indian medicinal and aromatic plants coupled with associated information (plant families, plant parts used for the medicinal purpose, structural information, therapeutic properties, etc.) We also developed a Java-based chemoinformatics open-source tool called DoMINE (Database of Medicinally Important Natural products from plantaE) for the generation of virtual library and screening of novel molecules from known medicinal plant molecules. We employed chemoinformatics approaches to in-silico screened metabolites from 104 Indian medicinal and aromatic plants and designed novel drug-like bioactive molecules. For this purpose, 1665 ring containing molecules were identified by text mining of literature related to the medicinal plant species, which were later used to extract 209 molecular scaffolds. Different scaffolds were further used to build a focused virtual library. Virtual screening was performed with cluster analysis to predict drug-like and lead-like molecules from these plant molecules in the context of drug discovery. The predicted drug-like and lead-like molecules were evaluated using chemoinformatics approaches and statistical parameters, and only the most significant molecules were proposed as the candidate molecules to develop new drugs.", "The supra network of molecules and scaffolds identifies the relationship between the plant molecules and drugs. Cluster analysis of virtual library molecules showed that novel molecules had more pharmacophoric properties than toxicophoric and chemophoric properties. We also developed the DoMINE toolkit for the advancement of natural product-based drug discovery through chemoinformatics approaches. This study will be useful in developing new drug molecules from the known medicinal plant molecules. Hence, this work will encourage experimental organic chemists to synthesize these molecules based on the predicted values. These synthesized molecules need to be subjected to biological screening to identify potential molecules for drug discovery research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Engineering and Process Development (CEPD) Division, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Pune - 411008, India."}], "LastName": "Karade", "ForeName": "Divya", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Engineering and Process Development (CEPD) Division, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Pune - 411008, India."}], "LastName": "Vijayasarathi", "ForeName": "Durairaj", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Kadoo", "ForeName": "Narendra", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioengineering Sciences & Research, MIT ADT University, Pune-412201, India; 5Publication and Science Communication, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Pune 411008, India."}], "LastName": "Vyas", "ForeName": "Renu", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Ingle", "ForeName": "P K", "Initials": "PK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Engineering and Process Development (CEPD) Division, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Pune - 411008, India."}], "LastName": "Karthikeyan", "ForeName": "Muthukumarasamy", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Comb Chem High Throughput Screen", "NlmUniqueID": "9810948", "ISSNLinking": "1386-2073"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cheminformatics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32504496", "10.2174/1386207323666200606211342", "CCHTS-EPUB-107141"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
