Brazil is among the 30 high-burden countries and most of the cases occur in the Legal Amazonian Region. New chemotherapeutical agents are needed for the treatment of malaria. Many plant species are used in traditional medicines of malarious countries and a relatively few number of these have been investigated for evaluation of their antimalarial effect. Still lower is the number of those that have had the active natural compounds isolated and the toxicity determined. This area is, then, of great research interest. discovery project of antimalarial natural products from plants traditionally used to treat malaria must include in vitro and in vivo assays as well as bioguided isolation of active compounds. The final products would be antimalarial chemical entities, potential new drugs or templates for new drugs development, and/or standardized antimalarial extracts which are required for pre-clinical and clinical studies when the aim is the development of effective and safe phythomedicines. This review discusses these two approaches, presents briefly the screening methodologies for evaluation of antimalarial activity and focuses the activity of alkaloids belonging to different structural classes as well as its importance as new antimalarial drugs or leads and chemical markers for phytomedicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Produtos Farmac\u00eauticos, Faculdade de Farm\u00e1cia, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brasil. alaidebraga@terra.com.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oliveira", "ForeName": "Ala\u00edde B", "Initials": "AB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dolabela", "ForeName": "Maria F\u00e2ni", "Initials": "MF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Braga", "ForeName": "Fern\u00e3o C", "Initials": "FC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "J\u00e1come", "ForeName": "Rose L R P", "Initials": "RL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Varotti", "ForeName": "Fernando P", "Initials": "FP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "P\u00f3voa", "ForeName": "Marinete M", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "An Acad Bras Cienc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503280", "ISSNLinking": "0001-3765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimalarials"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimalarials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "97"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19893898", "10.1590/s0001-37652009000400011", "S0001-37652009000400011"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
