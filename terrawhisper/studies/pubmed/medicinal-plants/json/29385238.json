Thus the aim of this study was to describe the chemical composition, volatile compounds, nutritional aspects and antioxidant activity of the fruit pulp and peel of B. sorbilis.", "Headspace solid-phase microextraction, using polydimethylsiloxane-divinylbenzene (PDMS-DVB) fiber, resulted in the identification of 59 substances in the pulp and peel of B. sorbilis fruits after analysis of the chromatograms obtained by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using polar and nonpolar columns. Esters were the most abundant. Moisture, lipids, protein, dietary fiber, ash, carbohydrate, total energy value, titratable acid, soluble solids and pH were measured. Protein amount, fat content and antioxidant activity were low in both pulp and peel. Carbohydrate content was 179.2 and 134.9 g kg<sup>-1</sup> in pulp and peel, respectively.", "This is the first report on the chemical characteristics, flavor and nutritional aspects of B. sorbilis fruit, which is essential to its economic exploitation. The high energy value associated with the carbohydrate content, plus the low fat content, contribute to a possible use of B. sorbilis fruits as a food supplement. \u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chromatography Laboratory, Chemistry Department, Federal University of Amazonas, Manaus, AM, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Rabelo Rodrigues", "ForeName": "Francimilton", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Medicinal Plants and Derivatives, Department of Chemistry of Natural Products, Farmanguinhos, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil."}], "LastName": "de Souza Ramos", "ForeName": "Aline", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Medicinal Plants and Derivatives, Department of Chemistry of Natural Products, Farmanguinhos, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Fernandes Amaral", "ForeName": "Ana Claudia", "Initials": "AC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Medicinal Plants and Derivatives, Department of Chemistry of Natural Products, Farmanguinhos, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Pinto Ferreira", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 Luiz", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Products and Food, Faculty of Pharmacy/UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil."}], "LastName": "da Silva Carneiro", "ForeName": "Carla", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chromatography Laboratory, Chemistry Department, Federal University of Amazonas, Manaus, AM, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Rocha de Andrade Silva", "ForeName": "Jefferson", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rubiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29385238", "10.1002/jsfa.8917"]}}]}
