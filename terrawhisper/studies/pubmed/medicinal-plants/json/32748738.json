The \u03b1-amylase is responsible for postprandial glucose levels; therefore, inhibiting its activity is helpful in diabetes management. Hence, to find natural inhibitors of \u03b1-amylase, we have prepared a 257 phytochemical library from selected medicinal plants with antidiabetic activity and conducted a virtual screening and molecular dynamics study. Seventy-nine phytochemicals were screened out of 257 phytochemicals based on binding energy, ranged from -10.1\u2009kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> to -7.6\u2009kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>. The binding energies of screened compounds were lower or equal to the reference molecule (-7.6\u2009kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>). The binding affinity of six screened phytochemicals was re-scored by X-SCORE. These phytochemicals were subjected to ADMET and Drug-likeness analysis. After screening docking and drug-likeness analysis, six phytochemicals viz., Shahidine, Epicatechin, Quercetin, Isocolumbin, Ellagic acid, Luteolin and a reference molecule (Acarbose) were subjected to Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to analyze the stability of the docked protein-ligand complex. The values of root mean square deviation, RMSF, RG, SASA, H-Bond, the interaction energy of all protein-ligand complexes were calculated after 30\u2009ns of MD simulation. The results of screened complexes revealed good stability as compared to reference Acarbose. Pharmacophore features of the screened phytochemicals and \u03b1-amylase inhibitors showed many common pharmacophore features. Based on finding the screened phytochemicals, e.g. Shahidine, Epicatechin, Quercetin, Isocolumbin, Ellagic acid, and Luteolin, may be used as a potential inhibitors against \u03b1-amylase. These phytochemicals could be optimized and synthesized to develop potential drugs to manage and treat diabetes, targeting \u03b1-amylase.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
