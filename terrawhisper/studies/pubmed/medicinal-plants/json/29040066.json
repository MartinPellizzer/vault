Although synthetic drugs are available and afford symptomatic relief, their side effects pose limitations to their continuous use. So, this research was focused on extracting drugs from indigenous medicinal plants that could have a beneficial effect on osteoarthritis. Dashmoolarishta is one such preparation whose effects have never been studied in comparison with recent drugs like hyaluronic acid (HA), hence this particular study was undertaken. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Dashmoolarishta compared with HA on joint pathology and pain behavior in monosodiumiodoacetate (MIA)-induced OA in experimental mice.", "The study was initiated after obtaining permission from the Animal Ethics Committee. This study was based on the MIA model of osteoarthritis, with mice being divided into five groups viz.: disease control (DC), Dasahmoolarishta high dose (HD) and low dose (LD), sham control (SC) and HA. The OA of the knee joint was induced in these mice using monosodiumiodoacetate. Seven days after induction, animals were subjected to weekly behavioral tests, daily oral Dashmoolarishta, and biweekly HA administration from weeks 2-4. At the end of the 4th week, histopathological examination of the knee joints was done.", "DC showed significant osteoarthritic changes. At week 4, the behavioral tests and histopathology results of all groups were found to be significant. A significant difference (p<0.05) was found between DC vs. SC, HA, HD, LD for open field test, Rota rod test, knee joint diameter, and Cat walk test. Dashmoolarishta HD and LD showed significant improvement in pain, as assessed by behavioral tests (p<0.05) and pathology, as assessed by knee joint histopathology (p<0.05).", "Oral Dashmoolarishta showed reduction in pain and disease activity in MIA-induced osteoarthritis in mice model."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "."}], "LastName": "Shetty", "ForeName": "Yashashri C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "."}], "LastName": "Godbharle", "ForeName": "Santosh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "."}], "LastName": "Brahma", "ForeName": "Smita", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "."}], "LastName": "Salgaonkar", "ForeName": "Sweta", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "."}], "LastName": "Rege", "ForeName": "Nirmala N", "Initials": "NN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9101750", "ISSNLinking": "0792-6855"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dashmoola"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9004-61-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Hyaluronic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WF5188V710", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodoacetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hyaluronic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iodoacetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoarthritis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29040066", "10.1515/jbcpp-2016-0141", "/j/jbcpp.ahead-of-print/jbcpp-2016-0141/jbcpp-2016-0141.xml"]}}]}
