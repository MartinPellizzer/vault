The rotation property of gossypol was mainly correlated with the species of the cottonseed; the area where the cottonseed was cultivated had no effect. Gossypol isolated from G barbadense was always levorotatory as a result of the excess of (-)-gossypol, whereas that from the other 2 species studied was always dextrorotatory due to the excess of (+)-gossypol.
