Two important mechanisms of ARF are inflammation and oxidative stress. Plants are rich source of antioxidant compounds and have a strong anti-inflammatory activity, so they may be useful for the treatment of ARF. Some herbal medicines are effective against different models of experimentally induced ARF such as cisplatin, gentamicin, glycerol, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Some of these plants such as ginseng, black seed, ginger, garlic, grape, pomegranate, saffron, and green tea are so famous and are effective against various models of ARF. However, we found several articles examining the effectiveness of different plants for treating ARF. In the current article, we discussed plants and natural products that are effective in the treatment of ARF."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Boozari", "ForeName": "Motahareh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3483-851X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, Department of Pharmacodynamic and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseinzadeh", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Acute Kidney Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29027276", "10.1002/ptr.5943"]}}]}
