From this source were extracted data, both from text and figures, in relation to plant nomenclature, habitat, morphology and geographical distribution; consequently those data were translated into present botanical terminology and then recombined according to the Flora of Turkey and the East Aegean Islands covering the area that Dioscorides was born and studied.", "All of the 40 CN plants indicated as Umbelliferae, presented a substantially documented identification. For 19 of them a novel combination was indicated and 4 of them proved new pharmaceutical plants. Applied methodology generated a documented correspondence between CN entries and contemporary Umbelliferae taxa nomenclature forming thus a promising new systematic tool for the study of relevant sources."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
