Genetics, excessive exposure to environmental pollutants, as well as unhealthy lifestyle practices are often linked to the development of AD. No therapeutic approach has achieved complete success in treating AD; however, early detection and management with appropriate drugs are key to improving prognosis.", "The pathogenesis of AD was extensively discussed in order to understand the reasons for the interventions suggested. The interventions reviewed include the use of different therapeutic agents and approaches, gene therapy, adherence to healthy dietary plans (Mediterranean diet, Okinawan diet and MIND diet), as well as the use of medicinal plants. The potential of nanotechnology as a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach in the design of nano-formulations of AD drugs and the use of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIONs) as theranostic tools for early detection of Alzheimer's disease were also discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Science Laboratory Technology, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ogbodo", "ForeName": "John O", "Initials": "JO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Agbo", "ForeName": "Chinazom P", "Initials": "CP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Njoku", "ForeName": "Ugochi O", "Initials": "UO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ogugofor", "ForeName": "Martins O", "Initials": "MO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Egba", "ForeName": "Simeon I", "Initials": "SI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ihim", "ForeName": "Stella A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Echezona", "ForeName": "Adaeze C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Spiritan University, Nneochi, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Brendan", "ForeName": "Kenneth C", "Initials": "KC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Sureshdada Shriman\\'s College of Pharmacy, New Dehli, India."}], "LastName": "Upaganlawar", "ForeName": "Aman B", "Initials": "AB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Sureshdada Shriman\\'s College of Pharmacy, New Dehli, India."}], "LastName": "Upasani", "ForeName": "Chandrashekhar D", "Initials": "CD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Aging Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101473576", "ISSNLinking": "1874-6098"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet, Mediterranean"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Early Diagnosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33653258", "10.2174/1874609814666210302085232", "CAS-EPUB-114643"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
