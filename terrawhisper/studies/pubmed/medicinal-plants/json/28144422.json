Vaginal examination, transrectal palpation and ultrasonography were used to inspect the genital tract at 30-40 days in milk and two weeks later the same approach was applied. Cows with clinical endometritis were randomly divided into three treatment groups: <i>Z. multiflora</i> extract (n = 56), penicillin + streptomycin (pen + strep, n = 55), and placebo (n = 20). Cervical cytology, reagent strip test and cell counting by means of Neubauer hemocytometer were carried out in both examinations. Clinical cure rate of cows with endometritis of score 1 were 45.5, 34.5 and 53.6% in placebo, pen + strep and <i>Z. multiflora</i>, respectively. Clinical cure rate of cows with endometritis of score 2, 3 were 66.7, 84.6 and 56.0% in placebo, pen + strep and <i>Z. multiflora</i>, respectively. Overall, proportions of successfully treated cows were 55.0, 58.2 and 54.7% in placebo, pen + strep and <i>Z. multiflora</i>, respectively (<i>p</i> > 0.05). In placebo, none of the parameters were significantly different between first and second examination, while we found the significant differences in percentage of neutrophils and leukocyte esterase activity in other groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05). First service conception rate of cows was higher in <i>Z. multiflora</i> compared to other groups; however, this difference was not significant. In conclusion, pen + strep and <i>Z. multiflora</i> extract can be effective on the clinical endometritis and may improve reproductive performance. The extract of <i>Z. multiflora</i> can be useful as an alternative therapy for treatment of clinical endometritis in lactating dairy cows."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PhD Candidate, Department of Clinical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hajibemani", "ForeName": "Abolfazl", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirzaei", "ForeName": "Abdolah", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, Islamic Azad University, Kazerun Branch, Kazerun, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rowshan Ghasrodashti", "ForeName": "Abbas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Formulation, Barij Medicinal Plants Research Center, Kashan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Memarzadeh", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Vet Res Forum", "NlmUniqueID": "101625812", "ISSNLinking": "2008-8140"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Fourichon C, Seegers H, Malher X.
