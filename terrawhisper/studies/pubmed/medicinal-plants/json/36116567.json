Low Cd dose had typically less negative impact than high Cd dose at the level of minerals and metabolites and the effect of BC doses often differed. Contrary to expectations, 0.5% BC with a high Cd dose increased Cd accumulation in plants about 2-fold. This was reflected in higher signals of reactive oxygen species, but especially the high dose of BC increased the amount of antioxidants (ascorbic acid and non-protein thiols), minerals and amino acids in shoots and/or roots and usually mitigated the negative effect of Cd. Surprisingly, the relationship between BC and soluble phenols was negative at high BC\u00a0+\u00a0high Cd dose, whereas the effect of Cd and BC on organic acids (mainly tartaric acid) differed in shoots and roots. Interestingly, BC alone applied to the control soil (1.5\u00a0mg total Cd/kg) reduced the amount of Cd in the plants by about 30%. PCA analyses confirmed that metabolic changes clearly distinguished the high Cd\u00a0+\u00a0high BC treatment from the corresponding Cd/BC treatments in both shoots and roots. Thus, it is clear that the effect of biochar depends not only on its dose but also on the amount of Cd in the soil, suggesting the use of Ca-rich biochar both for phytoremediation and safer food production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
