This study is aimed to investigate its anti-proliferation effect on HL-60 cells and the possible mechanism of inducing apoptosis. MTT assay was used to test HL-60 cells proliferation. The apoptosis, ROS levels and the mitochondrial membrane potential were detected by flow cytometry. Cytochrome c released from mitochondria to cytosol fraction was detected by Western blotting. The activity of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 were measured by colorimetric method. It was found to inhibit HL-60 cells proliferation in a dose and time-dependent manner. Compared with control group, it caused the increase of ROS levels and a concomitant dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and induced cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c and activities Caspase-9 and Caspase-3. Therefore it can be concluded that mitochondrial-dependent pathways was involved in its induction of apoptosis of HL-60 cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Wen-jing", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Feng-lan", "Initials": "FL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "632XD903SP", "NameOfSubstance": "Gallic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-43-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochromes c"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 9"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 9"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochromes c"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Gallic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HL-60 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19350820"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
