The diversity of marine products is a significant source of possible bioactive chemical compounds with a wide range of potential medicinal applications. Marine organisms produce natural compounds and new drugs with unique properties are produced from these compounds. A lot of bioactive compounds with medicinal properties are extracted from marine invertebrates, including Peptides, Alkaloids, Terpenoids, Steroids. Thus, it can be concluded that marine ecosystems are endowed with natural resources that have a wide range of medicinal properties, and it is important to examine the therapeutic and pharmacological capabilities of these molecules. So, finding particular inhibitors of the COVID-19 in natural compounds will be extremely important. Natural ingredients, in this light, could be a valuable resource in the progression of COVID-19 therapeutic options. Controlling the immunological response in COVID-19 patients may be possible by addressing the PI3K/Akt pathway and regulating T cell responses. T cell effector activity can be improved by preventing anti-viral exhaustion by suppressing PI3K and Akt during the early anti-viral response. The diversity of marine life is a significant supply of potentially bioactive chemical compounds with a broad range of medicinal uses. In this study, some biologically active compounds from marine organisms capable of inhibiting PI3K/AKT and the possible therapeutic targets from these compounds in viral infection COVID-19 have been addressed."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Copyright by the Author(s).
