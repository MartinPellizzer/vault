Among galacturonic-acid-containing components, elicitors and suppressors of the plant cell wall hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) were recovered. Two active small oligogalacturonides with degrees of polymerization of 2 and 3 were characterized by high-performance anion-exchange-chromatography pulsed amperometric detection and fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry; they elicited 40-70% hydroxyproline increase within 48 hours at 450 nmol/bean cutting. In contrast, pectic fragments of higher molecular mass, predominantly composed of galacturonic acid and containing sugars typical of the rhamnogalacturonan II domain of pectic polysaccharides, had the ability to substantially suppress hydroxyproline deposition. Maximum suppressor activity, 30-40% below the activity of the control, occurred in 48 hours. In view of the low one-cycle turnover of these proteins in the cell wall and of their structural role, these changes might significantly affect cell wall properties. Elicitation and/or suppression of hydroxyproline were correlated to modifications of HRGP-extensin gene expression. Northern-blot analysis of RNA showed that changes in the transcript intensity became clearly visible within the first 12 hours after the start of either treatment. The results show that pectic components of the plant extracellular matrix have the potential to regulate wall matrix biogenesis. Implications of this finding in plant defense and development are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre de Biologie et Physiologie V\u00e9g\u00e9tale, UA CNRS n. 1941, Universit\u00e9 Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France."}], "LastName": "Boudart", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dechamp-Guillaume", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lafitte", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ricart", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Barthe", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mazau", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Esquerr\u00e9-Tugay\u00e9", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0107600", "ISSNLinking": "0014-2956"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "extensin protein, plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "89NA02M4RX", "NameOfSubstance": "Pectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.15", "NameOfSubstance": "Polygalacturonase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Wall"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mitosporic Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polygalacturonase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7556193", "10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.tb20830.x"]}}]}
