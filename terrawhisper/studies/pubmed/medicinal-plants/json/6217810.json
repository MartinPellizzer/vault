Two coeluting peaks of primed and citrate-stimulated starch synthase activity and a major and minor peak of branching enzyme activity were observed in Alaska. However, in Progress #9, only one peak of synthase activity was found. When crude extracts of Progress #9 were centrifuged, over 70% of the starch synthase activity was recovered in the pelleted fraction, and additional washings of the pellet released no further activity. The addition of purified starch granules to Alaska crude extracts also resulted in the recovery of a greater proportion of synthase activity in pelleted fractions. The two peaks of branching enzyme activity in Alaska differed in their stimulation of phosphorylase, amylose branching activity, and activity in various buffers. The DEAE-cellulose profile of Progress #9 showed no distinct peak of branching enzyme and less than 10% of the total activity found in Alaska. The association of one form of soluble starch synthase with the pelleted fraction and the greatly reduced levels of branching enzyme provide a partial explanation for the appearance of high-amylose starch in Progress #9 cotyledons."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matters", "ForeName": "G L", "Initials": "GL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Boyer", "ForeName": "C D", "Initials": "CD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Genet", "NlmUniqueID": "0126611", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2928"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-82-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Amylose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9037-22-3", "NameOfSubstance": "Amylopectin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.1.18", "NameOfSubstance": "1,4-alpha-Glucan Branching Enzyme"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "1,4-alpha-Glucan Branching Enzyme"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Amylopectin"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Amylose"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Biochem Genet. 1982 Oct;20(9-10):833-48", "ArticleIdList": ["6217810"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 1978 Sep;190(1):85-96", "ArticleIdList": ["101153"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 1974 Feb;160(2):530-51", "ArticleIdList": ["4208773"]}, {"Citation": "Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1964 Dec 28;121:404-27", "ArticleIdList": ["14240539"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem Genet. 1982 Jun;20(5-6):483-92", "ArticleIdList": ["6214251"]}, {"Citation": "Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1973 Feb 9;210:90-103", "ArticleIdList": ["4572690"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1966 Aug;56(2):725-9", "ArticleIdList": ["5229990"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1946 Feb;162:229-38", "ArticleIdList": ["21020866"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1971 May 7;43(3):631-6", "ArticleIdList": ["4998187"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1978 Jan 13;80(1):169-75", "ArticleIdList": ["623651"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem J. 1962 Jan;82:156-64", "ArticleIdList": ["13901588"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem Genet. 1980 Dec;18(11-12):1207-19", "ArticleIdList": ["7247928"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1951 Nov;193(1):265-75", "ArticleIdList": ["14907713"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6217810", "10.1007/BF00484061"]}}]}
