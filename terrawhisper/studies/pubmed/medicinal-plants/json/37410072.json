Some of them have been used as herbal medicine and in pharmaceuticals, such as chikusetsu saponins and <i>Quillaja</i> saponins. However, the demand for these materials has remained largely a challenge owing to their natural scarcity and low-yielding purification process. Therefore, a chemical triterpene 3-<i>O</i>-glucuronidation was conducted in this study to alleviate the surging demand on natural source. Various glucuronyl imidate donors and oleanane-type triterpene acceptors were synthesized, and the relative reactivity values (RRV) and acceptor nucleophilic constants (Aka) were systematically measured to study their influence on glucuronidation yield. As a result, applying donors in higher RRV value generally improved the production of 3-<i>O</i>-glucuronide triterpenes. Meanwhile, a bulky pivaloyl group was an ideal 2-<i>O</i>-protection to provide \u03b2-selectivity and prevented side reactions, including orthoester formation and acyl-transfer reaction. Collectively, a positive correlation was observed between reactive donors/acceptors and improved glucuronidation yields. These findings offered insights on the influence of donors' and acceptors' reactivities on 3-<i>O</i>-\u03b2-glucuronide triterpenes synthesis, and this knowledge would help to access saponins of interest to address future needs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Yen-Hsun", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chou", "ForeName": "Yu-Ting", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "You-Yu", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yi-Chi", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Jing-Xiu", "Initials": "JX"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6668-4642"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Pi-Hui", "Initials": "PH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Org Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985193R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3263"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucuronides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucuronides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "14"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37410072", "10.1021/acs.joc.3c00709"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
