However, how the development of these propagules is regulated remains to be fully understood. Here, we show that nitric oxide (NO) is necessary for reproduction in\u00a0S.\u00a0eturmiunum.Application of NO scavenger carboxy-CPTIO (cPTIO) or soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) inhibitor NS-2028 abolishes propagules formation, which was increased by\u00a0a\u00a0supplement of sodium nitroprusside (SNP). SNP supplement also triggered increased biosynthesis of melanin, which can be inhibited upon the addition of arbutin or\u00a0tricyclazole, the specific inhibitors for DOPA and\u00a0DHN synthetic pathway, respectively. Intriguingly, enhanced melanin biosynthesis corelates with an increased propagules formation; The\u00a0SNP-induced increment propagules formation can be also compromised upon\u00a0the supplement of cPTIO or NS-2028. RT-PCR analysis showed that\u00a0SNP promoted transcription of\u00a0brlA,\u00a0abA and wetA at 0.2 mmol/L, but inhibited at 2 mmol/L. In contrast,\u00a0SNP increased transcription of\u00a0mat1, and\u00a0mat2, and the synthetic genes\u00a0for DHN and DOPA melanins at 2 mmol/L.\u00a0However, the increased transcription of these genes is down-regulated upon the supplement of cPTIO or NS-2028. Thus, NO regulates reproduction and melanin synthesis in\u00a0S.\u00a0eturmiunum possibly through\u00a0the NO-sGC-GMP signaling pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 British Mycological Society.
