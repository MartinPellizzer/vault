These enzymes also participate in the transformation of xenobiotics, inactivation of the cytostatics doxo- and daunorubicin, and play a role in the development of cancer. Therefore, inhibitors of such enzymes may improve therapeutic outcomes. Plant-derived compounds such as anthraquinones have been used for medicinal purposes for several centuries. In the current study, the inhibitory potential of selected anthrone and anthraquinone derivatives (from plants) was tested on six recombinant human carbonyl reducing enzymes (AKR1B1, AKR1B10, AKR1C3, AKR7A2, AKR7A3, CBR1) isolated from an Escherichia coli expression system. Overall, the least inhibition was observed with the anthrone derivative aloin, while IC<sub>50</sub> values obtained with the anthraquinone derivatives (frangula emodin, aloe emodin, frangulin A, and frangulin B) and the aldo-keto reductase AKR1B10 were in the low micromolar range (3.5-16.6\u00a0\u03bcM). AKR1B1 inhibition was significantly weaker in comparison with AKR1B10 inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> values\u00a0>\u00a050\u00a0\u03bcM). The strongest inhibition was observed with the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase CBR1. AKR7A2, AKR7A3, and AKR1C3 were not, or less inhibited by inhibitor concentrations of up to 50\u00a0\u03bcM. Analysis of the kinetic data suggests noncompetitive or uncompetitive inhibition mechanisms. The new inhibitors described here may serve as lead structures for the development of future drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
