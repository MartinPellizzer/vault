In an attempt to improve this issue, we synthesised a series of prodrugs by masking its terminal nitrogen of the piperazine moiety. Most synthesised prodrugs of 3 have low or no inhibition of PAK4 activity. The stability of synthetic prodrugs was evaluated in PBS, SGF, SIF, rat plasma and liver S9 fraction. Of these, prodrug 19 was not only stable under both acidic and neutral conditions but also could be quickly converted to parent drug 3 in rat plasma and liver S9 fraction. Such effective conversion into parent drug 3 was observed in rats, providing higher exposure of 3 compared to its direct administration. When given via oral route at daily doses of 25 and 50\u202fmg/kg, the prodrug 19 was effective and well tolerated in mouse model of HCT-116 and B16F10."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.
