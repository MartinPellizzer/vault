Tissue culture is the best method for propagation of stevia and micro nutrients can affect both morphological traits and steviol glycosides production. In the present study, we investigated the effect of different concentrations of glutamine (10, 20, 30 and 40 g/l) on expression of UGT74G1 and UGT76G1 genes and stevioside and rebaudioside A accumulation in the leaves of stevia under in vitro conditions. The highest level of expression for UGT74G1 (1.000 Total lab unit) was seen at plants grown in MS media without glutamine and the highest gene expression level for UGT76G1 (1.321 Total lab unit) was observed at plants grown in 2% glutamine. Based on HPLC results, the highest amount of stevioside (22.74) was accumulated in plants which were under 3% glutamine treatment and the lowest production level of stevioside (16.19) was resulted under MS (0 glutamine) medium. The highest rebaudioside A (12.19) accumulation was observed under 2% glutamine treatment and the lowest accumulation of rebaudioside A (8.41) was seen at plants grown in MS medium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Plants, Institute of Higher Education, Jahad-e-Daneshgahi, Kermanshah Unit, Iran."}], "LastName": "Esmaeili", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaheri", "ForeName": "Matin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fertility and Infertility Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kahrizi", "ForeName": "Danial", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, Medicine Faculty, Aja University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mansouri", "ForeName": "Mohsen", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, Medicine Faculty, Aja University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Safavi", "ForeName": "Seyed Mehdi", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "Tayebeh", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Muhammadi", "ForeName": "Sarre", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Sexual Medicine; and The Rhazes Center for Research in Family Health and Sexual Medicine, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rahmanian", "ForeName": "Elham", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vaziri", "ForeName": "Siavash", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes, Kaurane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0RH81L854J", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0YON5MXJ9P", "NameOfSubstance": "stevioside"}, {"RegistryNumber": "B3FUD0528F", "NameOfSubstance": "rebaudioside A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes, Kaurane"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glutamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Stevia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29433620", "10.14715/cmb/2018.64.2.1"]}}]}
