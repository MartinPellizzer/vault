The National Health Commission announced that a total of 103 kinds of medicinal and edible homologous plants (MEHPs) would be available by were available in 2023. Diabetes mellitus (DM) has become the third most common chronic metabolic disease that seriously threatens human health worldwide. Polysaccharides, the main component isolated from MEHPs, have significant antidiabetic effects with few side effects. Based on a literature search, this paper summarizes the preparation methods, structural characterization, and antidiabetic functions and mechanisms of MEHPs polysaccharides (MEHPPs). Specifically, MEHPPs mainly regulate PI3K/Akt, AMPK, cAMP/PKA, Nrf2/Keap1, NF-\u03baB, MAPK and other signaling pathways to promote insulin secretion and release, improve glycolipid metabolism, inhibit the inflammatory response, decrease oxidative stress and regulate intestinal flora. Among them, 16 kinds of MEHPPs were found to have obvious anti-diabetic effects. This article reviews the prevention and treatment of diabetes and its complications by MEHPPs and provides a basis for the development of safe and effective MEHPP-derived health products and new drugs to prevent and treat diabetes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
