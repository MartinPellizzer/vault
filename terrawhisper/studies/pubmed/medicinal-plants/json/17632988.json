This group was compared with the group controls (C), animals injected with a salt solution (NaCl 0.9%) and receiving aerosol challenge of salt solution. The OVA group was subdivided into two groups: A studied group 6 hours after the aerosol challenge of OVA. A studied group 24 hours after the aerosol challenge of OVA.", "We showed an increasing increase of airway hyperresponsiveness to increasing doses of histamine in all groups of animals. This increase was significantly more important 6 hours after the last aerosol challenge of OVA (early airway hyperreactivity, OVA-6 group, n = 8) that at 24 hours after the last aerosol challenge (late airway hyperreactivity, OVA-24 group, n = 8). We had also noted a modification of cellularity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with an increase of the total number of cells essentially by increase of the rate of eosinophilia in OVA-6 group (n = 6) compared with OVA-24 group (n = 6) and Control group (n = 6).", "The model of bronchial hyperreactivity and modification of cellularity in guinea pig will allow us to envisage studies on the origin of differences of ability to react in the group OVA-6 and OVA-24 and to study the medicinal efficiency of plants used in Senegal in the treatment of the asthma."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de physiologie de la Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine, de Pharmacie et d'Odonto-Stomatologie, Universit\u00e9 Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar, S\u00e9n\u00e9gal. asamb@ucad.sn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Samb", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pretrolani", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lanone", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ouksel", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aubier", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boczkowski", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Etude de la cellularit\u00e9 bronchoalv\u00e9olaire et de la r\u00e9activite des voies a\u00e9riennes a l'histamine dans un mod\u00e8le d'asthme chez le cobaye."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Senegal", "MedlineTA": "Dakar Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7907630", "ISSNLinking": "0049-1101"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Histamine Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "820484N8I3", "NameOfSubstance": "Histamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9006-59-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Ovalbumin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ovalbumin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17632988"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
