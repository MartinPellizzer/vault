Patients who failed to respond to initial treatment with Sojyutu-Sairei-to were additionally treated with Byakujyutu- Sairei-to, and the time course of ANA and ACLA titers in these patients was analyzed. ACLA titers were decreased significantly by the treatment of Byakujyutu-Sairei-to, however, the percentage of successfully prevented abortion cases did not differ significantly between the Sojyutu-Sairei-to treatment group and the Byakujyutu-Sairei-to treatment group. ACLA titer was decreased in all 10 cases where abortion was successfully prevented by the treatment with Sojyutu-Sairei-to or Byakujyutu-Sairei-to. In the cases where both ANA and ACLA were decreased following treatment with Sojyutu-Sairei-to or Byakujyutu-Sairei-to, the percentage of cases rated as \"Kyo\" and \"Rikan\" were significantly higher in the Byakujyutu-Sairei-to group. These results indicate that Byakujyutu-Sairei-to is effective against ACLA positive RSA through the antibody-reducing activity, which differs from that of Sojyutu-Sairei-to in individual cases. On the basis of these results, Sairei-to therapy, which is superior to aspirin and heparin in terms of efficacy and safety, is recommended as the first-line therapy for RSA of autoimmune etiologies. Furthermore, to elevate the percentage of successfully prevented abortions, it is advisable to select one of the two Sairei-to preparations (Sojyutu-Sairei-to and Byakujyutu-Sairei-to) on the basis of differential diagnosis using the methods of Oriental medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Corporation Kano Clinic, Osaka, Japan. kanoclin@pearl.ocn.ne.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kano", "ForeName": "Takashi", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shimizu", "ForeName": "Masahiko", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kanda", "ForeName": "Takayoshi", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Am J Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7901431", "ISSNLinking": "0192-415X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Anticardiolipin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Antinuclear"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunosuppressive Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["immunology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Abortion, Habitual"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Anticardiolipin"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Antinuclear"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Autoimmune Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diagnosis, Differential"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Immunosuppressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Therapeutic Equivalency"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20128042", "10.1142/S0192415X10007658", "S0192415X10007658"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
