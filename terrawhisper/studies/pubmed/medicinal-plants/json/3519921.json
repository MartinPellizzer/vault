Glycyrrhetic acid (GLA) was measured by an enzyme immuno-antibody technique. Glycyrrhetic glycosides (GLA-GS), such as glycyrrhizin, were measured after acid hydrolysis to GLA by the enzyme immuno-antibody assay. Five normal subjects were orally administered a decoction of licorice containing 133 mg of glycyrrhizin. It was found that the time required for maximum serum concentration of GLA-GS was less than 4 h after the administration. Although there were large individual differences, it was found that GLA-GS was eliminated from the blood for the most part within 72 h. On the other hand, GLA reached maximum serum concentration at about 24 h after administration and in two of the five cases it was still detected in the blood even after 96 h. Urinary excretion of GLA was about 2% of the total dose of glycyrrhizin administered. This suggested that there were great differences among the subjects in the absorption and urinary excretion of GLA-GS. The serum GLA levels in two clinical cases who presented pseudoaldosteronism by licorice containing formulations were as high as 70-80 ng/ml, with GLA-GS levels being very low. This fact suggests that pseudoaldosteronism develops in association with GLA rather than with GLA-GS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Terasawa", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bandoh", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tosa", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hirate", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Pharmacobiodyn", "NlmUniqueID": "7901854", "ISSNLinking": "0386-846X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P540XA09DR", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycyrrhetinic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhetinic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperaldosteronism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoenzyme Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3519921", "10.1248/bpb1978.9.95"]}}]}
