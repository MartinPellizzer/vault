Only a small portion of patients with olfactory loss respond to current medications. Thus, development of novel therapeutic strategies seems to be necessary. Looking into traditional medical knowledge can be of great value in addressing useful remedies. Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) has been practiced in Persia for more than 2000 years. Avicenna is the most eminent Persian physician.", "To survey Avicenna's views on etiology and management of olfactory loss and to search for relevant modern pharmacological data.", "Avicenna's views on etiology and management (including suggested medicinal plants) of olfactory loss were obtained from \"Canon of Medicine\". In addition, a detailed search in ScienceDirect, PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases was performed to elucidate relevant pharmacological actions and mechanisms of the plants and their major compounds with special focus on neuroprotective activity.", "Acorus calamus L., Allium cepa L., Allium sativum L., Aloe spp., Cinnamomum cassia (L.)
