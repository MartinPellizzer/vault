The present study was framed to assess the changes occurring in the essential-oil composition of H.\u00a0cordata during annual growth and to evaluate allelopathic, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiacetylcholinesterase activities. The essential-oil content ranged from 0.06\u00a0-\u00a00.14% and 0.08\u00a0-\u00a00.16% in aerial parts and underground stem, respectively. The essential oils were analysed by GC-FID, GC/MS, and NMR (<sup>1</sup> H and <sup>13</sup> C). Major constituents of aerial-parts oil was 2-undecanone (19.4\u00a0-\u00a056.3%), myrcene (2.6\u00a0-\u00a044.3%), ethyl decanoate (0.0\u00a0-\u00a010.6%), ethyl dodecanoate (1.1\u00a0-\u00a08.6%), 2-tridecanone (0.5\u00a0-\u00a08.3%), and decanal (1.1\u00a0-\u00a06.9%). However, major constituents of underground-stem oil were 2-undecanone (29.5\u00a0-\u00a042.3%), myrcene (14.4\u00a0-\u00a020.8%), sabinene (6.0\u00a0-\u00a011.1%), 2-tridecanone (1.8\u00a0-\u00a010.5%), \u03b2-pinene (5.3\u00a0-\u00a010.0%), and ethyl dodecanoate (0.8\u00a0-\u00a07.3%). Cluster analysis revealed that essential-oil composition varied substantially due to the plant parts and season of collection. The oils exhibited significant allelopathic (inhibition: 77.8\u00a0-\u00a088.8%; LD<sub>50</sub> : 2.45\u00a0-\u00a03.05\u00a0\u03bcl/plate), antibacterial (MIC: 0.52\u00a0-\u00a02.08\u00a0\u03bcl/ml; MBC: bacteriostatic) and antifungal (MIC: 2.08\u00a0-\u00a033.33\u00a0\u03bcl/ml; MFC: 4.16\u00a0-\u00a033.33\u00a0\u03bcl/ml) activities. The results indicate that the essential oil from H.\u00a0cordata has a significant potential to allow future exploration and exploitation as a natural antimicrobial and allelopathic agent."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre, Pantnagar, Uttarakhand, India."}], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Ram S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, M.B.
