(R. rugosa) was evaluated through analysis of spectrum-effect relationship. The ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) fingerprints of 21 batches of R. rugosa were evaluated by similarity analysis (SA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). The 28 common components were identified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-orbitrap-HRMS/MS). Meanwhile, the antidiabetic activities and antioxidant activities of 21 batches of R. rugosa were estimated in vitro. Besides, four chemometrics named principal component analysis (PCA), grey correlation analysis (GRA), partial least squares regression (PLSR) and the bivariate correlations analysis (BCA) were applied to construct spectrum-effect relationship between the UPLC fingerprints and biological activities of R. rugosa. The spectrum-effect relationship study revealed that di-O-galloyl-HHDP-glucoside, galloyl-HHDP-glucoside and avicularin were more relevant to antidiabetic activity. Di-O-galloyl-HHDP-glucoside, galloyl-HHDP-glucoside and ellagic acid were the main antioxidant components of R. rugosa. The current bioassay and spectrum-effect relationships are proper for associating sample quality with the active ingredient, and our finding would provide foundation and further understanding of the quality evaluation and quality control of R. rugosa."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
