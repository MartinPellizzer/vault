Cusson is a well-known Chinese medicinal plant, which has been used for the treatment of impotence, frigidity, and skin-related diseases, and exhibits strong antipruritic, antiallergic, antidermatophytic, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiosteoporotic activities. A high-speed counter-current chromatography method was developed for the separation and purification of five bioactive coumarins from this plant. The crude coumarins were obtained by ethanol extraction from the dried fruits of Cnidium monnieri (L.) Cusson under sonication. High-speed counter-current chromatography with the two-phase solvent systems n-hexane-ethyl acetate-ethanol-water (5:5:4:6, v/v) and n-hexane-ethyl acetate-ethanol-water (5:5:6:4, v/v) was successfully performed with stepwise elution. The five relatively pure coumarins were obtained from 500 mg of the crude extract in a single run. Their purities were 90.6-98.9%, and the recoveries were 85.7-94.2%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hua-Bin", "Initials": "HB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Sep Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101088554", "ISSNLinking": "1615-9306"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cnidium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15776929", "10.1002/jssc.200400002"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
