An investigation has been carried out with rats and human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, to determine the anti-inflammatory and analgesic potential of MRQ. Results obtained demonstrate that MRQ can significantly and dose-dependently inhibit carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema (the inhibition at 3h was greater than at 1h after induction of oedema). MRQ could also increase the reaction time of rats in the hot-plate test (by 57% after the first hour of treatment), although it had no effect on the reaction time in the tail-flick test, indicating that MRQ possesses analgesic activity that is probably mediated via a supra-spinal effect.MRQ also exerted a dose-dependent (a) protective effect on heat-induced erythrocyte lysis, and (b) inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase activity. In RA patients, after 3 months of MRQ treatment, there was a marked improvement in the pain and inflammation experienced by the patients as well as in the mobility of the affected joints. From the overall results obtained, it may be concluded that MRQ possesses significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. Alteration in synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, membrane stabilization and anti-oxidant activity are some of the possible mechanisms through which MRQ mediates its anti-arthritic effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya, 6, Talagolla Road, Ragama, Sri Lanka. nrthab@dynaweb.lk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thabrew", "ForeName": "M Ira", "Initials": "MI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dharmasiri", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Senaratne", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9000-07-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Carrageenan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis, Rheumatoid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carrageenan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sri Lanka"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12639750", "10.1016/s0378-8741(03)00016-3", "S0378874103000163"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
