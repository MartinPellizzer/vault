Hyacinth bean accessions were grown in Griffin, Georgia, from 2002 to 2004 and characterized for agronomic traits including branching, foliage, plant size, days to 50% maturity, and seed reproduction. The plants regenerated a range reaching more than 4,000 seeds. Assessment of variation was determined using principal component analysis. This paper also discusses evidence from literature reviews regarding clinical trials supporting possible uses of various hyacinth bean phytochemicals as nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals. Hyacinth bean seeds and pods could be used as famine food worldwide where humans suffer from malnourishment and disease. The purposes of this study are to characterize regenerating hyacinth bean genetic resources for branching, foliage, plant size, days to 50% maturity, seed production, and flower traits, as well as to discuss evidence from clinical trials supporting potential uses of various hyacinth bean containing phytochemicals as medicinal food, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceuticals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit, University of Georgia, Griffin, GA 30223-1797, USA.
