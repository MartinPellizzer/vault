All enrolled cases accorded with the enroll standard.

There were significant defferences between them. The total effectiveness ratio of two groups has no significant difference. After the treatment, the value of HA, PCIII, IV. C,LN decreased dramatically in treatment group and the antihepatic fibrosis results of treatment group were superior to those of control group. The four-step therapeutics of TCM could improve the ALT value and the ALT value declined to normal after the virus indexes' loss.
