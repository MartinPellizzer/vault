Such experimental data further promoted the usage of flavonoids as an aromatase inhibitor and helps prevent cancer, specifically breast and lung cancer. Conversely, flavonoids have certain limitations like low absorption, potency, and some side effects in addition to their tremendous advantages. The pharmacokinetics and toxicity of flavonoids are now being addressed by using advanced nanotechnological approaches. This review discusses the comprehensive aromatase signaling pathway in normal and cancer cells. It also draws attention to how do flavonoids modulate aromatase signaling pathways. Also, different flavonoid groups inhibiting aromatase activities are discussed and listed in the Table comprising flavonoids group, cancer type, clinical trials, IC50, and the assay employed. Moreover, nanoparticles-mediated improvement in the pharmacokinetics and toxicity issues of flavonoids in targeting aromatase are also deliberated. In conclusion, flavonoids act as a potential anticancer agent via targeting aromatase. Besides, nanotechnological approaches are useful in addressing the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of flavonoids."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioprospection and Product Development Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow- 226015, Uttar Pradesh,India."}], "LastName": "Seth", "ForeName": "Richa", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioprospection and Product Development Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow- 226015, Uttar Pradesh,India."}], "LastName": "Kushwaha", "ForeName": "Soni", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioprospection and Product Development Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow- 226015, Uttar Pradesh,India | Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad-201002, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Luqman", "ForeName": "Suaib", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioprospection and Product Development Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow- 226015, Uttar Pradesh,India | Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad-201002, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Meena", "ForeName": "Abha", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HCP 010", "Agency": "CSIR-Phytopharma Mission", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "GAP-394", "Agency": "CST", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Mol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "101467997", "ISSNLinking": "1874-4672"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aromatase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Aromatase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33568041", "10.2174/1874467214666210210123709", "CMP-EPUB-114086"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
