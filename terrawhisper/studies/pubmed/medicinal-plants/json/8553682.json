Osbeckia octandra is a plant used in traditional medicine to treat jaundice and other liver disorders. In this study, the effects of Osbeckia leaf extract on paracetamol-induced liver injury were investigated both in vivo in mice and in rat hepatocytes in vitro. 2. Oral administration of Osbeckia extract (330 mg/kg) at the same time as paracetamol (450 mg/kg) to mice, resulted in a significant protection (p < 0.05) against liver damage, as assessed by improvements in the blood Normotest (39.1 +/- 1.9 versus 46.3 +/- 2.0 s), total liver glutathione (730 +/- 39 versus 574 +/- 27 micrograms/250 mg liver), plasma aspartate aminotransferase level (916 +/- 225 versus 1965 +/- 291 iu/l), and liver histopathology at 24 h after paracetamol administration. 3. In experiments to assess the direct effects of Osbeckia extract, significant protection was also found in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes against damage induced by 185 microM 2,6-dimethyl N-acetyl p-quinoneimine (2,6-diMeNAPQI, an analogue of NAPQI, the toxic metabolite of paracetamol) in vitro. When Osbeckia extract (500 micrograms/ml) was added to the incubation medium at the same time as 2,6-diMeNAPQI significant changes in cell viability (78.4 +/- 3.3 versus 47.2 +/- 5.8% of control, p < 0.001), cell reduced glutathione (GSH) level (35.0 +/- 3.1 versus 23.8 +/- 1.5%, p = 0.009), and reduced release of lactate dehydrogenase (129.9 +/- 6.6 versus 224.6 +/- 12.1%, p < 0.001) were demonstrated after 1 h incubation as compared with 2,6-diMeNAPQI alone. 4. Significant protection was still obtained against 2,6-diMeNAPQI in vitro when addition of Osbeckia extract was delayed by 20 min. These results indicate that Osbeckia extract can protect against paracetamol-induced liver injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK."}], "LastName": "Thabrew", "ForeName": "M I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hughes", "ForeName": "R D", "Initials": "RD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gove", "ForeName": "C D", "Initials": "CD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Portmann", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "McFarlane", "ForeName": "I G", "Initials": "IG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Xenobiotica", "NlmUniqueID": "1306665", "ISSNLinking": "0049-8254"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "362O9ITL9D", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetaminophen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Acetaminophen"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8553682", "10.3109/00498259509046671"]}}]}
