With the advances of sequencing technologies, genomes for hundreds of horticultural crops have been deciphered in recent years, providing a basis for understanding gene functions and regulatory networks and for the improvement of horticultural crops. However, these valuable genomic data are scattered in warehouses with various complex searching and displaying strategies, which increases learning and usage costs and makes comparative and functional genomic analyses across different horticultural crops very challenging. To this end, we have developed a lightweight universal search engine, HortGenome Search Engine (HSE; http://hort.moilab.net), which allows for the querying of genes, functional annotations, protein domains, homologs, and other gene-related functional information of more than 500 horticultural crops. In addition, four commonly used tools, including 'BLAST', 'Batch Query', 'Enrichment analysis', and 'Synteny Viewer' have been developed for efficient mining and analysis of these genomic data."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
