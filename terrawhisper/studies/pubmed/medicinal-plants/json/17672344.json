Bleeding capacity (A540) was measured by cutting tail in 5 min. Plama recalcificatic time (RT) were measured in mice. Platelet aggregation was caused by adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), and thrombin time (TT) were measured by reagent boxes. During thrombosis in vitro, their lengths, wet and dry weights were measured by instrument; wet weights of arteriovenous experimental thrombosis were measured and the impressive rates were analyzed.", "CT and BT of groups PGE2-1 (60, 120 mg x kg(-1)) were remarkably prolonged, and bleeding capacity (A540) were significantly increased (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). RT of groups PGE2-1 (30, 60, 120 mg x kg(-1)) were remarkably prolonged, and platelet aggregation (PAG) were inhibited (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Human serous TT and APTT of groups PGE2-1 (10, 20, 40 mg x mL(-1)) were remarkably prolonged (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), but the difference of effect on PT had no statistic significance. PGE2-1 (30, 60, 120 mg x kg(-1)) could make the mice obviously eliminate thrombus symptom and reduce the time of restoring independent activity (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01); thrombosis in vitro: Lengths, wet and dry weights of groups PGE2-1 (30, 60, 120 mg x kg(-1)) were significantly decreased (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01); wet weights of arteriovenous experimental thrombosis were dramatically decreased (P < 0.01), and impressive rates were respectively 32.5%, 49.0% and 61.5%.", "PGE2-1 has remarkable effects of anticoagulation and antithrombosis, so it may be the main component of the isolation from G. elata in the field of antithrombosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biochencistry and Nicrobiology, Anhui University, Hefei 230039, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Cheng-shi", "Initials": "CS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Ye-shou", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Geng", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Zi", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticoagulants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fibrinolytic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoproteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticoagulants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Coagulation Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fibrinolytic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrodia"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Partial Thromboplastin Time"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prothrombin Time"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thrombin Time"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Thrombosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17672344"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
