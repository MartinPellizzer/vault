The mechanism of the diaease progression, which is lacking effective therapy, remains obsure. Therefore, there is a need to understand the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for disease development and progression in order to develop innovative therapies. To accomplish this goal, experimental animal models that recapitulate the human disease are necessary. Currently, an increasing number of studies have focused on natural constituents from medicinal plants which have been emerged as a new hope for NASH. This review summarized the pathogenesis of NASH, animal models commonly used, and the promising targets for therapeutics. We also reviewed the natural constituents as potential NASH therapeutic agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 China Pharmaceutical University. Published by Elsevier B.V.
