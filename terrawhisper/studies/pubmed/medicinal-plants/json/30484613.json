Artificial polyploidy is an efficient method to increase the production of secondary metabolites and can result in a whole spectrum of genetic, molecular and physiological modifications. In order to produce an autotetraploid population of nuruozak, various concentrations of colchicine (0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20 or 0.50 % w/v) were applied to the seeds and shoot apical meristems of young seedlings at the fourth leaf-stage. Microscopic studies, flow cytometry analysis and chromosome counting were conducted to select tetraploid nuruozak plants. Furthermore, the effects of ploidy level on the essential oil content and composition and biomass production of nuruozak plants, as well as selected structural and physiological characteristics were studied. Based on the number of the obtained tetraploids, treatment of shoot apical meristems was more efficient than seed treatment. Structural and phytochemical characteristics, chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate were affected by the increase in ploidy level. In addition to the higher potential in biomass production, tetraploid plants produced eight new compounds which were absent in diploids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Estaji", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hosseine", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ghotbi Ravandi", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sefidkon", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dehghan", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "THE EFFECTS OF COLCHICINEINDUCED AUTOTETRAPLOIDY ON SELECTED CHARACTERISTICS OF NURUOZAK (SALVIA LERIIFOLIA)."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ukraine", "MedlineTA": "Tsitol Genet", "NlmUniqueID": "0101671", "ISSNLinking": "0564-3783"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SML2Y3J35T", "NameOfSubstance": "Colchicine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Colchicine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tetraploidy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30484613"]}}]}
