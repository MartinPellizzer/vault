Those involved in the development of health care in the area believe that the tribal people have been exploited in education, health, and agriculture and have shown remarkable endurance in withstanding the effects of a profit seeking society. Private profit-seeking allopathic practitioners exploited the trust of the tribal people until 1985, when the allopathic approach to health care was abandoned. The local medicine men, the Vaidus, were asked to teach 3 health workers to identify roots, develop medicines from plants, and prepare and administer simple herbal remedies for common illnesses. This training was conducted at the Academy of Development Sciences in Kashele, Maharashtra. After the training was completed, each health worker was assigned 10 villages near Nandurbar. Each health worker contacted the Vaidus of each village and exchanged information. The revival of traditional knowledge was also reinforced by the preparation and showing a slides of various medicinal plants in the areas among the 30 villages. Workshops were also conducted along the Vaidus, who were open to exchanging information as long as it was not misused or practiced for personal gain. The Vaidus believed that the person administering treatment had to be honest, have respect for plants, know how to diagnose the illness, and be able to administer the remedy correctly. As a consequence, in the case of Shri Chunnilal Rupsingh of Vadzakhan village, the traditional application of Aloe barbadensis for an infected wound on his hand proved to be the best option. The treatment, available at the private clinic in Nandurbar a considerable distance from the village, was expensive and required multiple return trips. Health care problems of women still need to be addressed; the maintenance of herbal and medicinal gardens is being encouraged."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["084743", "00224878"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: HEALTH FOR THE MILLIONS"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Asia", "Case Studies", "Community Participation", "Critique", "Cultural Background", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Demographic Factors", "Developing Countries", "Health", "Health Services", "India", "Indigenous Health Services", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Organization And Administration", "Plants, Medicinal", "Population", "Population Characteristics", "Research Methodology", "Southern Asia", "Studies", "Tribes"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12318298", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1994", "Month": "03", "Day": "09"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "03"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0970-8685", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "1", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1993", "Month": "Jun"}}, "Title": "Health for the millions", "ISOAbbreviation": "Health Millions"}, "ArticleTitle": "Health and indigenous development.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "6", "EndPage": "7", "MedlinePgn": "6-7"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "D'souza", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Health Millions", "NlmUniqueID": "9879305", "ISSNLinking": "0970-8685"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Community Participation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Demography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnicity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services, Indigenous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organization and Administration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Characteristics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12318298"]}}]}
