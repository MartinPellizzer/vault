To investigate the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon, the effects of superfusion with normal Tyrode's solution and superfusion with Tyrode's solution containing 4 X 10(-8)M of ouabain in ischemic Purkinje fibers were compared. Ischemic Purkinje fibers of small endocardial preparations from 1 day old myocardial infarcts in 18 dogs were used for the study. During control conditions, these endocardial preparations demonstrated delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. Superfusion with normal Tyrode's solution resulted in a gradual increase in maximal diastolic potential and action potential amplitude, a decrease in delayed afterdepolarizations amplitude and slowing and termination of triggered activity. Superfusion for 90 minutes with Tyrode's solution containing ouabain resulted in: 1) an increase in the magnitude of delayed afterdepolarizations in preparations demonstrating subthreshold delayed afterdepolarizations, 2) sustainment of triggered activity in preparations showing nonsustained triggered activity, and 3) shortening of cycle lengths of the triggered activity in preparations demonstrating sustained triggered activity before superfusion with ouabain. These effects occurred despite the gradual increase in maximal diastolic potential and action potential amplitude. Superfusion of normal Purkinje fibers with Tyrode's solution containing 4 X 10(-8)M of ouabain for 90 minutes did not result in delayed afterdepolarizations or triggered activity. Thus, ouabain at a concentration that has no toxic effect on normal Purkinje fibers may enhance arrhythmias in ischemic Purkinje fibers by increasing the magnitude of delayed afterdepolarizations and enhancing triggered activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hariman", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zeiler", "ForeName": "R H", "Initials": "RH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gough", "ForeName": "W B", "Initials": "WB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "El-Sherif", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Coll Cardiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8301365", "ISSNLinking": "0735-1097"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isotonic Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tyrode's solution"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5ACL011P69", "NameOfSubstance": "Ouabain"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Action Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Arrhythmias, Cardiac"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Coronary Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Conduction System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isotonic Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Infarction"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ouabain"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Perfusion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Purkinje Fibers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3973265", "10.1016/s0735-1097(85)80393-4", "S0735-1097(85)80393-4"]}}]}
