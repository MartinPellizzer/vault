In the present study an attempt was made to validate the ethnopharmacological use of a traditional formulation in hepatoprotection against paracetamol induced hepatotoxicity. Swiss albino mice (weight 20-25 g) were used for this study. Intraperitoneal injection (IP) of paracetamol (500 mg/kg body weight) was used to induce hepatotoxicity.

In addition total cholesterol, triglyceride, Low density lipoprotein (LDL), High density lipoprotein (HDL) and creatinine were also assayed using standard procedure. Among the two different doses, pre-treatment with Polyherbal extract at 500 mg/kg body weight exhibited a significant (P < 0.05) hepatoprotective activity as compared to paracetamol group.
