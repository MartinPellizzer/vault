Chronic inflammation leads to a broad range of physical and pathophysiological distress. For many years, non-steroidal drugs and corticosteroids were most frequently used in treating inflammation and related ailments. However, long-term usage of these drugs aggravates the conditions of chronic diseases and is presented with morbid side effects, especially in old age. Hence, the quest for safe and less toxic anti-inflammatory compounds of high therapeutic potential with least adverse side effects has shifted researchers' attention to ancient medicinal system. Resveratrol (RSV) - 3,4,5<sup>'</sup> trihydroxystilbene is one such naturally available polyphenolic stilbene derivative obtained from various plant sources. For over 2000\u2009years, these plants have been used in Asian medicinal system for curing inflammation-associated disorders. There is a wealth of <i>in\u00a0vitro</i>, <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> and clinical evidence that shows RSV could induce anti-aging health benefits including, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, phytoesterogenic, and cardio protective properties. However, the issue of rapid elimination of RSV through the metabolic system and its low bio-availability is of paramount importance which is being studied extensively. Therefore, in this article, we scientifically reviewed the molecular targets, biological activities, beneficial and contradicting effects of RSV as evinced by clinical studies for the prevention and treatment of inflammation-mediated chronic disorders."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Cancer Biology Laboratory, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati, Guwahati, India."}], "LastName": "Venkat", "ForeName": "Ramya", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Cancer Biology Laboratory, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati, Guwahati, India."}], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Elika", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Cancer Biology Laboratory, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati, Guwahati, India."}], "LastName": "Daimary", "ForeName": "Uzini Devi", "Initials": "UD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Cancer Biology Laboratory, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati, Guwahati, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Aviral", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Cancer Biology Laboratory, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati, Guwahati, India."}], "LastName": "Girisa", "ForeName": "Sosmitha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Cell and Molecular Biology Laboratory, Cotton University, Guwahati, India."}], "LastName": "Dutta", "ForeName": "Uma", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Science in Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "Kwang Seok", "Initials": "KS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Cancer Biology Laboratory, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati, Guwahati, India."}], "LastName": "Kunnumakkara", "ForeName": "Ajaikumar B", "Initials": "AB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Invest", "NlmUniqueID": "8307154", "ISSNLinking": "0735-7907"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "Q369O8926L", "NameOfSubstance": "Resveratrol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Resveratrol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Farms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35993769", "10.1080/07357907.2022.2115057"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
