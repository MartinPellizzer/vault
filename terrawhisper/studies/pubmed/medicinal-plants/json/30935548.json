The score of nipple fissure before the intervention and on the third and eighth day after the study was measured using the Stour scale.", "The mean score of left and right breast fissures in the group of treatment with lanolin group similar to the group of treatment with purslane cream showed a significant decrease at the third day and eighth day (P=0.001). Mann-Whitney test comparing mean score of the fissure between two groups showed that two groups were homogeneous before the intervention, but there was a significant difference between two groups on the third and eighth days (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The recovery process occurred faster in the group of treatment with purslane cream.", "We showed that the use of purslane cream without any complications could accelerate the repairing of nipple fissure.
