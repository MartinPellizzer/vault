In folkloric medicine, it is used for the treatment of various diseases and conditions, including pain, liver diseases, kidney stones and inflammations.", "Recently, many commoners use this plant as adjuvant therapy for treating symptoms associated with liver diseases and thalassemia. Thus, the present study was conducted to evaluate, biochemically, the iron chelating activity of G. tournefortii methanolic extract in iron overloaded rats.", "Fifty Wister male rats were divided into five groups: one group was a healthy control, while iron overload was induced in the other four groups by 100\u00a0mg/kg iron-dextran. Of these, one group was left untreated as a control, while the other three groups were treated with 50\u00a0mg/kg deferoxamine, 100\u00a0mg/kg and 200\u00a0mg/kg of G. tournefortii methanolic extract, respectively. The total flavonoid and phenolic contents of the methanolic extract were estimated. The biochemical assessment was performed by measuring blood levels of iron, ferritin, liver biomarkers (ALT, ALP and AST), cardiac biomarkers (CPK and LDH) and lipid profile.", "Not only the blood levels of iron, ferritin, liver biomarkers and cardiac biomarkers were reduced significantly by G. tournefortii methanolic extract, but also the lipid profile was improved. This clearly supports the chelating activity of G. tournefortii and its hepatoprotective and cardioprotective effects in iron overloaded rats.", "This highlights the value of medicinal plants as alternative therapies for iron overload conditions such as thalassemia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
