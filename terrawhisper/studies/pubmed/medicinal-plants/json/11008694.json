The interaction of the cyanobacterial and plant partners results in their spatial integration into aggregates of specific anatomy, which arise periodically during the mixed culture growth. The morphology of the cyanobacterial cells varies depending on their localization in the combined aggregate. The degree of cyanobacterial heteromorphism increases with time of growth of the association. Evidence of the plant origin of the factors inducing heteromorphic changes in N. muscorum was obtained, as well as evidence indicating that these factors can rapidly diffuse in agarized medium. A conclusion is inferred that the heteromorphic cells correspond to bacterial forms that appear during unbalanced growth as an adaptation to altered environmental conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cellular Physiology and Immunology, Moscow State University, Vorob'evy gory, Russia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gorelova", "ForeName": "O A", "Initials": "OA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Prostranstvennaia integratsiia partnerov i geteromorfizm tsianobakteriiNostoc muscorum CALU 304 v smeshano\u012d kul'ture s tkan'iu rauvol'fii."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Mikrobiologiia", "NlmUniqueID": "0376652", "ISSNLinking": "0026-3656"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Rauwolfia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Symbiosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11008694"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
