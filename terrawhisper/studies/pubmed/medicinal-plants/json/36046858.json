The complex eco-environment and climate conditions here have created rich and diverse vegetation. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the spatial distribution characteristics of rare and endangered medicinal plant resources in Gansu province for formulating reasonable protection po-licies and promoting the development of medicinal plant industry. The data of rare and endangered medicinal plant resources in 87 counties of Gansu province were collected from results of the fourth general survey. The spatial distribution and the high-or low-value gathering area of rare and endangered medicinal plant resources in Gansu province were analyzed by geostatistical methods such as exploratory spatial data analysis, trend surface analysis, and Anselin Local Moran's I. The eco-environment characteristics of the high-or low-value gathering area were analyzed with the data of vegetation type, soil texture classification, annual mean temperature, annual mean precipitation, and elevation. Furthermore, the relationships of the spatial distribution and diversity with the geographical environment of rare and endangered medicinal plants in Gansu province were analyzed to provide support for the restoration and protection policy making of these plant resources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Medicine Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Xi", "ForeName": "Shao-Yang", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Medicine Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Hou-Kang", "Initials": "HK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Medicine Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Yan-Xiu", "Initials": "YX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Medicine Lanzhou 730000, China Research Institute of Chinese (Tibetan) Medicinal Resources Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hui", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Medicine Lanzhou 730000, China Research Institute of Chinese (Tibetan) Medicinal Resources Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Tian-Tian", "Initials": "TT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Medicine Lanzhou 730000, China Research Institute of Chinese (Tibetan) Medicinal Resources Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tibet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "38"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36046858", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210831.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
