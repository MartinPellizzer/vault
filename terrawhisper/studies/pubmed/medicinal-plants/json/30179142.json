All synthesized compounds 4a-o were evaluated against breast cancer cell lines including MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and T-47D using MTT assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, cell cycle analysis, and TUNEL assay as the mechanism of cell death.", "Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited more potent cytotoxicity than standard drug, etoposide.
