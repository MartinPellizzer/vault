The effectiveness of Tricutan in improving skin firmness and elasticity in photoaged facial skin was examined in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, split-face study in 28 women, 34-67 years old. Treatment with Tricutan and placebo was given for 4 weeks. Skin firmness and elasticity was evaluated using the speed of propagation of ultrasound shear waves in the skin as end point (Reviscometer RVM 600). The study was completed by 25 women. The Tricutan treatment resulted in a significantly reduced propagation speed indicating increased firmness. There was no immediate effect by Tricutan application on propagation speed. At self evaluation the women evaluated the treatment effect of Tricutan to be significantly better than the treatment effect of placebo. The clinical evaluation also showed Tricutan to give a significantly better treatment result than placebo. Tolerance to Tricutan was generally good. However, three women did not complete the study because of mild irritative contact dermatitis. The results show that Tricutan can increase skin firmness both objectively and subjectively. Further studies are warranted, especially to investigate if Tricutan can delay the need for surgical face-lift procedures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dermatology Clinic, Danav\u00e4gen 7B, SE-18131 Liding\u00f6, Sweden. bea.hudmontt@telia.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sommerfeld", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Phytomedicine", "NlmUniqueID": "9438794", "ISSNLinking": "0944-7113"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Keratolytic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "tricutan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2N6K9DRA24", "NameOfSubstance": "Deanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Cutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Deanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Face"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Keratolytic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Aging"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17923398", "10.1016/j.phymed.2007.09.015", "S0944-7113(07)00240-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
