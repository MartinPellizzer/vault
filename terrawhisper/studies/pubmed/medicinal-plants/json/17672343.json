After 24 hours of postoperation, the 48 athymic mice were distributed randomly into 4 groups which were treated by intragastric administration with complex prescription of Chinese crude drug that had been deliquated into 3 groups by the different density as the low, middle, and high and FT207 (Tegafur) for 4 weeks. At last, athymic mice were put to death and PTEN was detected in hepatic tissue, latero-cancer tissue and cancer tissue by immunohistochemistry (PowerVision Two-Step Histostaining Reagent).", "All of the 48 athymic mice survived 12 to 28 days (Ms 24 days) and every mouse with liver cancer demonstrated by dissection. The result of immunohistochemistry represents that the intensity of PTEN in latero-cancer tissue is the highest, and then the hepatic tissue, the lowest is cancer tissue, P < 0.01. It also represents that the intensity of PTEN in treatment groups (A, B, C) is more higher than the control group (D), P < 0.05 or P < 0.01, and group B is the highest in the treatment groups, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01. However, there is no significant statistic difference between group A and group C.", "The higher expression of PTEN in the laterocancer tissue can represent the protective reaction of stress of the organism. And anticancer effect of this complex prescription of Chinese crude drug relates to an eligible density of it. Mechanisms of this complex prescription of Chinese crude drug healing HCC may partially be explained by enhancing the expression of PTEN in liver."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Bao-guo", "Initials": "BG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ze-xiong", "Initials": "ZX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shi-jun", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yong-dong", "Initials": "YD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Hong-zhong", "Initials": "HZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Li-rong", "Initials": "LR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.67", "NameOfSubstance": "PTEN Phosphohydrolase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Nude"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "PTEN Phosphohydrolase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17672343"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
