Separations were carried out using LC-MS/MS with a Chrom Matrix HP amide column (5\u2009m, 10\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u20093.0\u2009mm i.d.). The mobile phases were (A) 0.01\u2009mm formic acid and (B) acetonitrile. Good linearity was found for all analytes (R<sup>2</sup> \u00a0>\u20090.995) in the concentration range from 5 to 1000 \u03bcg/L with LLOQ at 5 \u03bcg/L for VTM and VTS; and from 1 to 1000 \u03bcg/L with LLOQ at 1 \u03bcg/L for PJV, JV, VA and VTG. Accuracy of the assay varied from 90.5 to 108.1%. The extraction recovery and matrix effect of six analytes ranged from 72.2 to 95.5% and from 79.2 to 98.4%. According to the stability test, six analytes in rat plasma were stable during the analysis process. On the basis of validation of the assay, the pharmacokinetics of the six steroid alkaloids were investigated after oral administration of Lilu extracts to rats."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7250-7092"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences, Changchun, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jianbo", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicinal Material, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, Jilin, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Lixue", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences, Changchun, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Meijia", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences, Changchun, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Yinshi", "Initials": "Y"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CAAS-ASTIP-2016- ISAPS", "Agency": "The Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "1610342017017", "Agency": "The Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "1610342017017", "Agency": "Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Steroids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Veratrum Alkaloids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limit of Detection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemistry", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Steroids"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemistry", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Veratrum Alkaloids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30187929", "10.1002/bmc.4377"]}}]}
