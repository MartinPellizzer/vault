(Fabaceae: Mimosoideae) is a native Australian plant used traditionally by Australian Aboriginal groups. This study was undertaken to investigate the bioactivity of A. ligulata extracts and to evaluate their chemical composition. Potential antibacterial, cytotoxic and enzyme inhibitory effects relevant to traditional medicinal and food uses of the species were examined and LC-MS/MS was performed to investigate the chemical composition. Antibacterial activity was observed for bark and leaf extracts with an MIC for the bark extract of 62.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL against Streptococcus pyogenes. Pod extracts showed cytotoxic effects against cancer cells, with the highest activity against melanoma SK-MEL28 cells with IC<sub>50</sub> values between 40.8 and 80.6\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Further, the leaf and pod extracts also inhibited \u03b1-amylase EC-3.2.1.1 and \u03b1-glucosidase EC-3.2.1.20 with IC<sub>50</sub> values between 9.7-34.8 and 12.6-64.3\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively. The LC-MS/MS profiling indicated that several different saponins were present in the active extracts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8183-7942"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [],
