According to zolpidem and GABA binding conformations, the key residues that were indicated to be the determination of binding were consistent with our simulation. Investigation of the major effective constituents from suanzaoren to modulate the GABA-A was the aim of the study. Jujuboside A, which was indicated to be the effective constituent from suanzaoren, had no blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and was unable to bind at both binding sites due to its large volume. In addition, the glycoside groups on jujuboside A were easily to be hydrolyzed. In contrast, jujubogenin, which was hydrolyzed from jujuboside A, had the most compatible binding conformation. In addition, jujubogenin formed two HBs with the key residue beta(2)-Thr226 and beta(2)-Tyr229 at the GABA binding site. Moreover, it gained the comparably highest scoring values among suanzaoren constituents. Furthermore, the Adsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) descriptor predicted that jujubogenin have good BBB penetration. Consequently, we suggested jujubogenin to be the effective suanzaoren constituent to mediate the GABA-A receptor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, 40402 Taiwan, ROC. ycc@mail.cmu.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "C Y-C", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Y-F", "Initials": "YF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "H-Y", "Initials": "HY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biomol Struct Dyn", "NlmUniqueID": "8404176", "ISSNLinking": "0739-1102"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, GABA-A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "jujubogenin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "56-12-2", "NameOfSubstance": "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7K383OQI23", "NameOfSubstance": "Zolpidem"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S50MZ3Y08R", "NameOfSubstance": "suanzaoren"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood-Brain Barrier"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pyridines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, GABA-A"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zolpidem"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18533726", "10.1080/07391102.2008.10507223", "d=3031&c=4260&p=16666&do=detail"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
