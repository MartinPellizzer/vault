Many synthetic drugs, although fast-acting, can cause a range of side effects for patients when taken over a long period, such as irritation of the digestive tract and a burden on the kidneys. As the world's population ages, the prevalence of osteoporosis is increasing, and the development of safe and effective treatments is urgently needed. Active compounds in edible and medicinal homologous plants have been used for centuries to improve bone quality. It is possible to employ them as dietary supplements to prevent osteoporosis. In this review, we analyze the influencing factors of osteoporosis and systematically summarize the research progress on the anti-osteoporosis effects of active compounds in edible and medicinal homologous plants. The literature suggests that some naturally occurring active compounds in edible and medicinal homologous plants can inhibit bone loss, prevent the degeneration of bone cell microstructure, and reduce bone fragility through alleviating oxidative stress, regulating autophagy, anti-inflammation, improving gut flora, and regulating estrogen level with little side effects. Our review provides useful guidance for the use of edible and medicinal homologous plants and the development of safer novel anti-osteoporosis dietary supplements."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Finance and Economics/Collaborative Innovation Center for Modern Grain Circulation and Safety, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Huiling", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Medicine, School of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Weng", "ForeName": "Zebin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Biology and Biotechnology, Bialystok University of Technology, Bialystok, Poland."}], "LastName": "Kalinowska", "ForeName": "Monika", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Finance and Economics/Collaborative Innovation Center for Modern Grain Circulation and Safety, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Finance and Economics/Collaborative Innovation Center for Modern Grain Circulation and Safety, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Luanfeng", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Finance and Economics/Collaborative Innovation Center for Modern Grain Circulation and Safety, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Haizhao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3311-770X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Finance and Economics/Collaborative Innovation Center for Modern Grain Circulation and Safety, Nanjing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry and Food Science, Instituto de Agroecolox\u00eda e Alimentaci\u00f3n (IAA) - CITEXVI, Universidade de Vigo, Nutrition and Bromatology Group, Vigo, Spain."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Jianbo", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Finance and Economics/Collaborative Innovation Center for Modern Grain Circulation and Safety, Nanjing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Finance and Economics/Collaborative Innovation Center for Modern Grain Circulation and Safety, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Xinchun", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39093554", "10.1080/10408398.2024.2386449"]}}]}
