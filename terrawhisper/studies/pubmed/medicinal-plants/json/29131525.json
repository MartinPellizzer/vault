The important factors affecting on the extraction recovery including pH, the volume of extraction solvent, ionic strength, and the number of injections were investigated and optimized by Box-Behnken design and desirability function. Under the optimum experimental conditions, the calibration graph was linear in the concentration range of 1.0-300.0\u00a0\u03bcg/L (r<sup>2\u00a0</sup> =\u00a00.997) for phenobarbital and 2.0-400.0\u00a0\u03bcg/L (r<sup>2\u00a0</sup> =\u00a00.996) for phenytoin. The limit of detection and limit of quantification were 0.35 and 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/L for phenobarbital and 0.65 and 2.2\u00a0\u03bcg/L for phenytoin, respectively. The relative standard deviation for six replicate determinations at 10\u00a0\u03bcg/L was 3.3 and 4.1% for phenobarbital and phenytoin, respectively. The developed method was successfully applied to the determination of phenobarbital and phenytoin in urine and plasma samples."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
