Furthermore, the traits including the hundred-fruit weight, shape index, and the ratio of seed to fruit were measured, and the correlations between the content of chemical compounds and fruit traits were assessed. The results showed that L. truncatum, L. barbarum var. auranticarpum, and L. dasystemum var. rubricaulium were the species with high content of monosaccharides. L. barbarum and L. barbarum var. auranticarpum were the species with high content of total polysaccharides, and L. barbarum was the species with high content of carotenoids. L. yunnanense and L. chinense var. potaninii had high content of soluble proteins. L. truncatum, L. dasystemum, and L. barbarum showed high content of organic acids and phenols. L. barbarum and L. barbarum var. auranticarpum demonstrated high fruit weight, while L. yunnanense and L. chinense had high ratios of seed to fruit. The multivariate statistical analysis indicated that polysaccharides, carotenoids, hundred-fruit weight, ratio of seed to fruit, scopolamine, fructose, 5-O-feruloylquinic acid, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, scopoletin, cryptochlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid were the main differential compounds in the fruits among different species of Lycium. Moreover, the results of correlation ananysis showed strong correlations between fruit traits and compound content. Specifically, the hundred-fruit weight had positive correlations with the content of total polysaccharides and scopola-mine. The ratio of seed to fruit was negatively correlated with the content of rutin, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, fructose, and glucose and positively correlated with the content of succinic acid, soluble proteins, and zeaxanthin. The results implied that chemical compounds presented different distribution patterns in the fruits of 8 Lycium species. This study provides a basis for the comprehensive development and utilization, targeted breeding, and value-added application of Lycium plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
