In the present study, the antinociceptive effects of chrysin were examined in ICR mice. Chrysin orally administered at the doses of from 10 to 100\u2005mg/kg exerted the reductions of formalin-induced pain behaviors observed during the second phase in the formalin test in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the antinociceptive effect of chrysin was further characterized in streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy model. Oral administration chrysin caused reversals of decreased pain threshold observed in diabetic-induced peripheral neuropathy model. Intraperitoneally (i.p.) pretreatment with naloxone (a classic opioid receptor antagonist), but not yohimbine (an antagonist of \u03b12-adrenergic receptors) or methysergide (an antagonist of serotonergic receptors), effectively reversed chrysin-induced antinociceptive effect in the formalin test. Moreover, chrysin caused a reduction of formalin-induced up-regulated spinal p-CREB level, which was also reversed by i.t. pretreated naloxone. Finally, chrysin also suppressed the increase of the spinal p-CREB level induced by diabetic neuropathy. Our results suggest that chrysin shows an antinociceptive property in formalin-induced pain and diabetic neuropathy models. In addition, spinal opioid receptors and CREB protein appear to mediate chrysin-induced antinociception in the formalin-induced pain model."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).
