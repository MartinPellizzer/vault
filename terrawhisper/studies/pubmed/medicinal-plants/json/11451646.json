In the first method, the analysed taxoids eluted in 75% methanol, but in the second method, the preliminary elution with 30% methanol was made. DAB III and its six derivatives were separated from co-extractives in merely acetonitrile-water gradient mode during 25 min on Waters Symmetry C-18 column with photodiode array (PDA) detection. The total recoveries for 10-DAB III and paclitaxel in the first SPE method (all compounds were applied in amounts of 80 microg) were about 98 and 94%, respectively. Almost 100% recoveries for paclitaxel and baseline separation of 10-DAB III and co-extracted compounds were obtained when preliminary elution with 30% methanol was performed. This method can be applied as a routine, inexpensive and uncomplicated procedure for 10-DAB III and related taxoids determination in yew material."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Medical University, Peowiakow 12 St., 20007 Lublin, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mroczek", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Glowniak", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Biomed Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "8309336", "ISSNLinking": "0731-7085"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Taxoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4K6EWW2Z45", "NameOfSubstance": "10-deacetylbaccatine III"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60650-90-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Silica Gel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P88XT4IS4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Paclitaxel"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Paclitaxel"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silica Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taxoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taxus"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11451646", "10.1016/s0731-7085(01)00353-3", "S0731-7085(01)00353-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
