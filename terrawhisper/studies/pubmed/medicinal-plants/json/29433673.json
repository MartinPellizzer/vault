As a positive control, rats were orally administered 10\u202fmg/kg/day nifedipine. Hypertension was induced by immobilization stress for 2\u202fh/day and by administration of 0.8\u202fmg/kg/day nicotine for 3 weeks, followed by injection of 3\u202fmg/kg nicotine on the day of sacrifice. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured using a volume pressure recording system. Vasoconstriction and vasodilation of aortic cross sections were measured with a physiological recorder. Neutrophil counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were estimated with an automated cell counter.", "Treatment with both dosages of ECL significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) in hypertensive rats. Both doses of ECL tended to increase ACh- and SNP-induced vascular relaxation in hypertensive rats. Treatment with 200\u202fmg/kg ECL significantly reduced neutrophil in hypertensive rats.", "These results suggest that ECL is effective in reducing SBP and inflammation in hypertensive conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier GmbH.
