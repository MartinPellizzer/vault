The effects of field bean tannin-containing hulls (T-hulls), non-tannin hulls (NT-hulls) and tannin extract on starch digestibilities and TMEn of triticale and semipurified starches from triticale and field beans were evaluated with adult cockerels and 3-week-old-chicks. 2. For both cockerels and chicks, the digestibility and TMEn of semipurified starches from triticale were higher than those from beans. Starch digestibilities of triticales (range 99.1 to 97.7%), of semipurified starches from triticales (range 96.5 to 89.9%) and from field beans (range 75.4 to 71.6%) were similar for both cockerels and chicks. 3. The addition of NT-hulls improved, in general, the digestibility of semipurified starches for both chicks and cockerels, which suggests that fibre improves the digestion of semipurified starches. 4. The effects of tannins of T-hulls on semipurified starch from beans and from triticale were different. Tannins always decreased the digestibility and TMEn of semipurified starch from field beans but only decreased the digestibility and TMEn of semipurified starch from triticale when fed to chicks, but not when fed to cockerels. 5. The addition of tannin extract always decreased the digestibility of semipurified starches by a greater amount than T-hulls, which supports the idea that the effect of tannins depends on the quantity of tannin ingested."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Producci\u00f3n Animal, Facultad de Veterinaria, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain."}], "LastName": "Flores", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Casta\u00f1on", "ForeName": "J I", "Initials": "JI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "McNab", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br Poult Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "15740290R", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food, Fortified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8062111", "10.1080/00071669408417692"]}}]}
