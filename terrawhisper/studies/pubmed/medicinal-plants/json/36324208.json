Fengtou ginger is a variety mainly grown in Central China. From June to September of 2021, leaf yellow spot symptoms were observed on ginger plants var. Fengtou in commercial fields, localized in Laifeng county (29.37\u309cN, 109.31\u309cE), Hubei Province, China. Early symptoms were small yellow spots (approximately 0.2 cm) on leaves, but these spots gradually expanded, and the middle turn brown. The incidence of yellow spot on plants was 15% to 35%. To identify the causal agent of the disease, 15 symptomatic leaves were collected on from plants in the field. From each ginger leaf, small fragments (2 to 4 mm) were cut from the margin of the lesions and surface disinfected with 75% ethanol and 2% sodium hypochlorite for 30 s and 60 s, respectively, and rinsed three times with sterile water (Zhong et al. 2022). The disinfected small fragments were placed on Rose Bengal Agar medium at 25 \u2103. After 3 to 5 days of incubation, a total of 11 isolates from leaf samples were obtained, of which 8 showed a radial mycelial growth that was grayish and then darkened. Conidiophores were brown and branched. Conidia were multicellular, obclavate to obpyriform within 9.1-22.6 \u00b5m (average 14.3 \u00b5m) in length and 6.0-13.5 \u00b5m (average 7.9 \u00b5m) in width (n=30). The isolates were identified as Alternaria sp. according to their morphological characteristics (Simmons 2007). For further molecular identification, genomic DNAs of two representative isolates (isolate 1 and isolate 4) were extracted and amplificated using a set of primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), RPB2-5F/RPB2-7R (Liu et al. 1999) and gpd1/gpd2 (Berbee et al. 1999), for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-rDNA region, partial RNA polymerase II largest subunit (RPB2), and Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GADPH), respectively. The sequences were submitted to GenBank with submission Nos. OM701795 and OM701794 for ITS-rDNA; OM864662 and OM864663 for RPB2; OM864664 and OM864665 for the GADPH gene. A BLAST analysis in GenBank showed 100% identity with A. alternata for ITS (GenBank No. MN907440), RPB2 (GenBank No. KP057228) and GADPH (GenBank No. MK637444), respectively. A pathogenicity test was performed on potted healthy plants of ginger var. Fengtou of 2.5-month-old in a greenhouse. A total of five plants were sprayed with a conidial suspension (105 spores/mL) of each isolate on leaves until runoff (3 to 5 ml per plant) occurred. Five plants were sprayed with sterile water. The plants were grown in a greenhouse at 25 \u2103. Eight days after inoculation, the symptoms similar to diseased leaves in the field appeared on the inoculated leaves, while the controls remained healthy. The fugus re-isolated from infected tissues was morphologically and molecularly identical to the original isolates of A. alternata, which fulfill the Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. alternata causing yellow spot on ginger in China. The work will be beneficial to develop effective management methods for preventing and treating this disease and avoid yield and economic loss of ginger in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Biopesticide Engineering Research Center, No.8 Nanhu RD, Hongshan District, Wuhan, Hubei , China, 430064; hzh0005@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Hongtao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Biopesticide Engineering Research Center, Wuhan, Hubei , China; gongyan1026@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Biopesticide Engineering Research Centre, Wuhan, Hubei , China; cao-chunxia@163.com."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Chunxia", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Biopesticide Engineering Research Center, Wuhan, Hubei , China; ronghua.zhou@nberc.com."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Ronghua", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Biopesticide Engineering Research Center, Wuhan, Hubei , China; 70404013@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Cuijun", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Biopesticide Engineering Research Center, Wuhan, Hubei , China; zhuzhigang@nberc.com."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Zhigang", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "54"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36324208", "10.1094/PDIS-02-22-0363-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
