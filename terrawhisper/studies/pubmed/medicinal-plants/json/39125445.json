Medicine-and-food homology plants contain a diverse set of natural bioactive compounds with promising development potential. This study screened and identified potent pancreatic lipase inhibitors from 20 commonly consumed medicine-and-food homology plants using affinity ultrafiltration combined with spectroscopy and docking simulations. The results showed that turmeric exhibited the highest pancreatic lipase-inhibitory activity, and curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin were discovered to be potent pancreatic lipase inhibitors within the turmeric extract, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.52 \u00b1 0.04, 1.12 \u00b1 0.05, and 3.30 \u00b1 0.08 mg/mL, respectively. In addition, the enzymatic kinetics analyses demonstrated that the inhibition type of the three curcuminoids was the reversible competitive model, and curcumin exhibited a higher binding affinity and greater impact on the secondary structure of pancreatic lipase than found with demethoxycurcumin or bisdemethoxycurcumin, as observed through fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism. Furthermore, docking simulations supported the above experimental findings, and revealed that the three curcuminoids might interact with amino acid residues in the binding pocket of pancreatic lipase through non-covalent actions, such as hydrogen bonding and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, thereby inhibiting the pancreatic lipase. Collectively, these findings suggest that the bioactive compounds of turmeric, in particular curcumin, can be promising dietary pancreatic lipase inhibitors for the prevention and management of obesity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Urban Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chengdu National
