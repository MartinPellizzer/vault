Using the human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 Glc(-/+) cell line we identified sub-populations of tumoural cells with markedly different characteristics in terms of metabolic capacities, adhesion properties and distribution in the cell cycle phases. After 1 and 2 days treatment with 100 microM DADS HT-29 cells were largely released into the culture medium. These floating cells accumulated in the G(2)/M phase and were characterized by a 5-fold reduction in cell capacity for de novo protein synthesis. Polyamine metabolism, which is necessary for intestinal epithelial cell attachment and growth, was also severely affected, since 3-fold reductions in polyamine biosynthesis and net accumulation of putrescine were measured after DADS treatment. However, oxidation of L-glutamine, the main precursor of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in these cells, and de novo synthesis of glutathione, a tripeptide involved in tumoural cell chemoresistance, were not affected by DADS treatment. In contrast, the adherent sub-population of HT-29 cells, although partially accumulated in G(2)/M phase, were characterized by unaffected metabolic capacities when compared with control cells except for putrescine accumulation, which was transiently decreased, and L-glutamine oxidation, which was increased 2-fold. DADS-resistant cells selected within 5 days were then able to proliferate at a similar rate to control untreated cells. The DADS-induced changes in HT-29 metabolic capacities, adhesion properties and the cell cycle are discussed from a causal perspective."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Nutrition et S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Alimentaire, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, 78350 Jouy-en-Josas, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Robert", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mouill\u00e9", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mayeur", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Michaud", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blachier", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Carcinogenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8008055", "ISSNLinking": "0143-3334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60G7CF7CWZ", "NameOfSubstance": "allyl sulfide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenocarcinoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Colonic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HT29 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11470743", "10.1093/carcin/22.8.1155"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
