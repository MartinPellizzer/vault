In earlier blinded studies demographic characteristics and the patients' motives of using alternative medicine had been recorded, but a correlation with individual illnesses had not been possible.", "142 patients of a oncological outpatient clinic gave their experience with alternative medicine in interviews and non-blinded questionnaires, 103 of them (72.5%; 46 men and 57 women; median age 58 years, range 18-91 years) returning questionnaires that could be evaluated.", "46 patients stated that they had used alternative medicine. There was no difference between users and non-users regarding sex; age, profession, education, family status or religion. 58% of all patients with advanced disease used alternative medicine, compared with only 31% with partial remission or stable disease and 41% in complete remission (P = 0.042). Vitamins and mistletoe preparations were the most commonly used substances (50 and 45%, respectively). The predominant purpose was to stimulate the immune system (77%) and strengthen general physical capacity (64.5%). As main stimulus for using alternative medicine the patients came from their family doctor (56%), followed by family and friends (41%). Alternative medicine was used largely as complementary and not an alternative to conventional medicine. Health insurance met all or some of the costs of alternative treatment in 59% of patients.", "A large number of patients treated with conventional oncological regimens also use alternative medicine, most of them because of a polypragmatic attitude to tumor treatment. Family doctors and health insurance companies are playing a more important role than had hitherto been assumed in spreading the use of treatment options without providing scientifically based evidence of their efficacy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Abteilung f\u00fcr H\u00e4matologie und Onkologie, Universit\u00e4t von Texas."}], "LastName": "Grothey", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "D\u00fcppe", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hasenburg", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Voigtmann", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Anwendung alternativmedizinischer Methoden durch onkologische Patienten."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Dtsch Med Wochenschr", "NlmUniqueID": "0006723", "ISSNLinking": "0012-0472"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Family"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Immune System"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics"], "DescriptorName": "Insurance, Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interviews as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Naturopathy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physicians, Family"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9721567", "10.1055/s-2007-1024099"]}}]}
