In this study, a split-type photoelectrochemical immunoassay for the sensitive quantification of CEA has been successfully developed based on the target-induced <i>in situ</i> formation of a Z-type heterojunction. First, gold nanoparticle-decorated ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> (AuNPs/ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>) composites were synthesized and used for the fabrication of photoelectrodes. Then, the detection antibody labeled with Ag nanoparticles was formed and applied for the biorecognition of CEA and subsequent liberation of Ag<sup>+</sup> ions to induce the <i>in situ</i> formation of Ag<sub>2</sub>S/AuNPs/ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>, a Z-type heterojunction, on the photoelectrode. The Z-type Ag<sub>2</sub>S/AuNPs/ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> heterojunction with effectively promoted separation of photogenerated charge carriers could lead to a markedly enhanced photocurrent response and highly sensitive quantification of CEA. Moreover, the three-dimensional spatial structure of ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> provides abundant active sites for the reaction and exhibits non-enzymatic properties, which are conducive to the further improvement of the analytical performance of CEA. The developed split-type photoelectrochemical immunoassay with good sensitivity, satisfactory selectivity, reliable stability, wide dynamic linear range (0.01-20 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>), and low detection limit (7.3 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>) offers valuable insights into the development of novel PEC biosensing models for the detection of tumor biomarkers and holds potential application value in the field of disease diagnosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Advanced Manufacturing, Fuzhou University, Jinjiang 362200, People's Republic of China. zhangky@fzu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jianhui", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Advanced Manufacturing, Fuzhou University, Jinjiang 362200, People's Republic of China. zhangky@fzu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Meirong", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Advanced Manufacturing, Fuzhou University, Jinjiang 362200, People's Republic of China. zhangky@fzu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9986-5634"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Advanced Manufacturing, Fuzhou University, Jinjiang 362200, People's Republic of China. zhangky@fzu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Kangyao", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0009-7796-213X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan International Joint Laboratory of Medicinal Plants Utilization, College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng 475000, People's Republic of China. zhouqian@henu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0245-4925"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Modern Analytical Science and Separation Technology of Fujian Province, Key Laboratory of Pollution Monitoring and Control of Fujian Province, College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Environment, Minnan Normal University, Zhangzhou 363000, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Wenqiang", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9126-5546"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Analysis and Detection for Food Safety (Ministry of Education & Fujian Province), Institute of Nanomedicine and Nanobiosensing, Department of Chemistry, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350108, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Dianping", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Anal Methods", "NlmUniqueID": "101519733", "ISSNLinking": "1759-9660"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinoembryonic Antigen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-57-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Gold"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoembryonic Antigen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gold"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoassay"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38488115", "10.1039/d4ay00248b"]}}]}
