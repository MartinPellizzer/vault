Deaths were ascertained by forms sent to doctors in hospitals and assistants in health centers, by visiting hospital and centers regularly, and from reports to Regional Medical Officers. The majority of deaths occurred in hospitals, producing a maternal mortality rate of 2.5/1000 in hospitals, compared to 0.8/1000 for the Zone overall. Total numbers and notable cases were discussed in each of the following etiologies: ectopic pregnancy (1), sepsis after abortion (20), placenta previa (3), eclampsia (4), postpartum hemorrhage (21), anemia (3), obstructed labor (6), puerperal infection (10), sepsis after surgery (7), puerperal pulmonary embolism (2), aspiration after anesthesia (1), herbal medicines (2). The greatest number of deaths were in gravida 3 women. The main avoidable factors were lack of blood for transfusion, no partogram being kept in labor, and risk factors noted but not acted upon. Blood was not available for several reasons: blood not kept in maternity ward, equipment not available to transfuse and relatives refused to give blood. Some other avoidable risk factors were: lack of or slow transport to facility, interference abortion, no antenatal care, lack of gas gangrene serum, packing vagina with cloths to stop bleeding, staff errors. It was felt that isolation of rural doctors contributed to errors, which may possibly be avoided by holding periodic seminars and reviews."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["052409", "00195015"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY OF EASTERN AND CENTRAL AFRICA"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Abortion, Septic", "Africa", "Africa South Of The Sahara", "Bacterial And Fungal Diseases", "Case Studies", "Causes Of Death", "Cervical Laceration", "Cesarean Section", "Delivery", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Demographic Factors", "Developing Countries", "Diseases", "Eastern Africa", "Embolism", "Endometritis", "English Speaking Africa", "Health", "Health Facilities", "Health Services", "Health Surveys", "Hospitals", "Infections", "Maternal Mortality", "Medicine", "Mortality", "Mortality Determinants", "Obstetrical Surgery", "Perforations", "Plants, Medicinal--side effects", "Population", "Population Dynamics", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Pregnancy Outcomes", "Pregnancy, Ectopic", "Pulmonary Embolism", "Reproduction", "Reproductive Tract Infections", "Research Methodology", "Rural Health Centers", "Studies", "Surgery", "Surgical Error", "Tanzania", "Treatment", "Vascular Diseases"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12283147", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1991", "Month": "04", "Day": "15"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "10"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1012-8867", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "3", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1984", "Month": "Sep"}}, "Title": "Journal of obstetrics & gynaecology of Eastern and Central Africa", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Obstet Gynaecol East Cent Africa"}, "ArticleTitle": "Preliminary report on maternal deaths in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania in 1983.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "103", "EndPage": "110", "MedlinePgn": "103-10"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Price", "ForeName": "T G", "Initials": "TG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Kenya", "MedlineTA": "J Obstet Gynaecol East Cent Africa", "NlmUniqueID": "8402696", "ISSNLinking": "1012-8867"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abortion, Septic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa South of the Sahara"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa, Eastern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cause of Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cervix Uteri"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cesarean Section"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery, Obstetric"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Demography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Embolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endometritis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "General Surgery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Facilities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Surveys"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maternal Mortality"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medical Errors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mortality"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Obstetric Surgical Procedures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Dynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Complications"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy, Ectopic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Embolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tanzania"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Therapeutics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12283147"]}}]}
