In this study, we determined the damage time and transcript levels of a large number of genes in the heart and thyroid after cold exposure. Meanwhile, we analysed the relationship between heart and thyroid injury in human medical records to determine the association of delayed injury from cold exposure.", "Mice were exposed to cold stress and hysteresis injury. Gene changes at the transcriptional level were detected using high throughput sequencing technology. The most variable genes were verified at the protein level using Western Blotting and medical records were collected and analysed.", "The damage was the most severe when the animals were allowed to recover to room temperature for 4\u00a0h after exposure to cold stress. During this process, STAT1 and ATF3 genes were acutely up-regulated. Analysis of human medical records showed the highest correlation between AST and T4 under cold stress (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0011).", "Exposure to cold increases blood level of free thyroid hormone and biomarkers of myocardial injury, as well as related mRNA levels.
