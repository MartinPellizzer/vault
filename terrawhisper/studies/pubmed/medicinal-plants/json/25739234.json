The FTIR and corresponding second derivative infrared (SDIR) spectra were analyzed comparatively from two aspects, namely, different extracts from a same extraction process and the same extracts from different methods. The spectral analysis results show that different extracts obtained from a same extraction process have distinctly different spectral absorbance character. Although the IR spectral absorption characteristics of the same extracts from different methods are rather similar in holistic, some explicit spectral differences still could be found among each other. In extraction process one (M1), main flavonoids and their glycosides of AP migrated to EtOAc-E and the rest part of them shift to n-BuOH-E according to FTIR peaks such as 1,603 and 1,123 cm(-1). However, the circumstances in method two (M2) and method three (M3) were just the reverse. Moreover, a few flavonoid glycosides got into H2O-E. The relative content of all kinds of aglycones and higher saturated alkyl are much higher in EtOAc-E of M2 than that of M1 and M3 according to the relative absorption intensive of peak at 2,850 cm(-1). Similarly, n-BuOH-E of M3 has relative rich contents of glycosides: and polysaccharides than those of M1 and M2 by peaks, such as 1,066 and 2,927 cm(-1). These results demonstrate that the migration rules of AP components are not always same in different extrac- tion process. The substance migration information during the extraction process could be recorded and disclosed in an intuitive way by FTIR tracking analysis of corresponding extracts. Consequently, FTIR tracking analysis is a fast, efficient, low-carbon and environment-friendly process analysis method. The method has important macro guiding significance for quality control and process optimization of extraction and isolation process of medicinal plant including AP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Xian-Xue", "Initials": "XX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tai", "ForeName": "Xi", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Liu-Xian", "Initials": "LX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jin-Lan", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Yao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Qun", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Su-Qin", "Initials": "SQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi", "NlmUniqueID": "9424805", "ISSNLinking": "1000-0593"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Caryophyllaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25739234"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
