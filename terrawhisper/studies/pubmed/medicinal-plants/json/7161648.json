Oleic and linoleic acids were determined to be the major unsaturated fatty acids in the oil. Long chain saturated fatty acids, such as behenic and lignoceric acids, were found in relatively high amounts as compared with other edible seed oils. The fatty acids that could not be separated by gas liquid chromatography were identified as linolenic acid and arachidic acid respectively on mass spectrometric analysis. Parinaric acid, previously reported by Cerny et al., was not detected and this supposed fraction was instead found to be eiconsenoic acid. Erucic acid, suspected of having an adverse effect on myocardial lesions in rats, was detected but only in small quantity. The identifications of these unsaturated fatty acids were further confirmed by deducing the location of the double bonds in their moieties. From these findings, winged bean seed oil can be suggested as being a food source of favorable quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Higuchi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Terao", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Iwai", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0402640", "ISSNLinking": "0301-4800"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fats"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fats"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7161648", "10.3177/jnsv.28.511"]}}]}
