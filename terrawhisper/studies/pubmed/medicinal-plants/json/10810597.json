Aedes proved more sensitive to the effect of extract in terms of mortality than Culex. At a high concentration (8 ppm), 100% Aedes larvae died in the first instar within two days whereas, 16 pmm was required for achieving the same level of mortality in Culex. Culex was also found more sensitive than Aedes regarding IGR effect. In emerging Culex pupae several abnormalities were observed while Aedes pupae did not exhibit any abnormalities. However larvae which pupated successfully resulted in adults with several structural abnormalities in both the species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, University of Delhi, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sagar", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sehgal", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agarwala", "ForeName": "S P", "Initials": "SP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Commun Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "0261652", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5138"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Aedes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Culex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10810597"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
