The low production level of sennosides in the plant is an important impediment to their growing demand and utilization. Understanding biosynthetic pathways helps to engineer them in terms of enhanced production. The biosynthetic pathways of sennoside production in plants are not completely known yet. However, attempts to get information on genes and proteins engaged in it have been made which decode involvement of various pathways including shikimate pathway. 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) is a key enzyme involved in sennosides production through the shikimate pathway. Unfortunately, there is no information available on proteomic characterization of DAHPS enzyme of senna (caDAHPS) resulting in lack of knowledge about its role. We for the first time characterized DAHPS enzyme of senna using <i>in-silico</i> analysis. To the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to identify the coding sequence of caDAHPS by cloning and sequencing. We found Gln179, Arg175, Glu462, Glu302, Lys357 and His420 amino acids in the active site of caDAHPS through molecular docking. followed by molecular dynamic simulation. The amino acid residues, Lys182, Cys136, His460, Leu304, Gly333, Glu334, Pro183, Asp492 and Arg433 at the surface interact with PEP by van der Waals bonds imparting stability to the enzyme-substrate complex. Docking results were further validated by molecular dynamics. The presented <i>in-silico</i> analysis of caDAHPS will generate opportunities to engineer the sennoside biosynthesis in plants.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
