In recent years, <i>Candida</i> species have shown resistance against many synthetic drugs, which has highlighted the need for novel antifungal drugs with fewer side effects for effective management of candidiasis. Several studies have suggested that some plant species possess promising antimicrobial compounds. <i>Piper betle</i> and <i>Ocimum sanctum</i> Linn are such common medicinal plants that show strong antimicrobial activity by the release of secondary metabolites. However, the effect of these plants on oral candidiasis has not been studied and hence, the present study aimed to evaluate the antifungal activity of these plant extracts on the subcultures of <i>C. albicans</i> and compared with a standard drug, fluconazole.", "Subcultures of <i>C. albicans</i> obtained from oral thrush patients were used in the present study. Ethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts of <i>P. betle</i> (betel) and <i>O. sanctum</i> L. (tulsi) leaves were prepared by cold extraction method. The anticandidal activity and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were evaluated using disc diffusion method and microbroth dilution method, respectively. Values were compared with the standard drug fluconazole.", "Both the extracts exhibited anticandidal activity on the subcultures of <i>C. albicans</i>. The ethyl acetate extract of mature betel leaf showed a maximum zone of inhibition (26 mm) when compared with tulsi and fluconazole (13 mm). Betel leaf extract showed better MIC values (125 \u03bcg/ml) than tulsi (2000 \u03bcg/ml). However, these values were high when compared with those of fluconazole (62.5 \u03bcg/ml).", "Ethyl acetate extract of mature betel leaf exhibited good anticandidal activity than that of tulsi and fluconazole."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2019 Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, Narayana Dental College and Hospital, Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Sivareddy", "ForeName": "Basireddy", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, Narayana Dental College and Hospital, Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Reginald", "ForeName": "Bernard Ajay", "Initials": "BA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, Narayana Dental College and Hospital, Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Sireesha", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, Narayana Dental College and Hospital, Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Samatha", "ForeName": "Meda", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, Narayana Dental College and Hospital, Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Reddy", "ForeName": "K Himakar", "Initials": "KH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, Narayana Dental College and Hospital, Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Subrahamanyam", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Oral Maxillofac Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "101227995", "ISSNLinking": "0973-029X"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Akpan A, Morgan R.
