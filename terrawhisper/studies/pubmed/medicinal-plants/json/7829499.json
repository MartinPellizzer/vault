We have examined the role of the delta pH in the latter mechanism by simultaneously monitoring the magnitude of delta pH (by 9-aminoacridine fluorescence quenching) and the rate of import of the 23-kDa photosystem II protein into isolated pea thylakoids. We show that protein import can take place, at low but significant rates, at very low values of delta pH (in the region of 1.2-1.4), and that plots of the rate of protein import against proton concentration gradient are probably hyperbolic in nature. There is no evidence for a threshold level of delta pH which is required to drive translocation of the 23-kDa protein. Addition of uncouplers midway during import incubations results in a rapid and complete inhibition of translocation, showing that the continuous presence of the delta pH is required for translocation to take place. During import into intact chloroplasts, the intermediate-size 23-kDa protein substrate for the thylakoidal protein transport machinery is found only in the stromal fraction at all values of delta pH, suggesting that the initial interaction with the machinery is relatively weak, reversible and delta pH-independent. We therefore propose that the delta pH is required for both the initiation and completion of translocation; these roles are in marked contrast to the roles of protonmotive force in mitochondrial and sec-dependent bacterial protein transport."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Brock", "ForeName": "I W", "Initials": "IW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mills", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Robinson", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Robinson", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorescent Dyes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "78OY3Z0P7Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Aminacrine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8L70Q75FXE", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aminacrine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescent Dyes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intracellular Membranes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7829499", "10.1074/jbc.270.4.1657", "S0021-9258(18)85406-0"]}}]}
