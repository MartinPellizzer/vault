The differences among these compounds are the substituents and stereochemistry at C-13. Their structures were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR experiments, and the absolute configurations of Scuteformoids A, C, E, F, and I were further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Scuteformoids A, C, D, F, H, and I were evaluated for their inhibitory effects against HIV lytic replication and cytotoxic activities. All of them showed weak anti-HIV activities, with EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 48.24 to 79.17\u00a0\u03bcg/mL."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017.
