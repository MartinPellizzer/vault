Two dissolution media, 0.1 N hydrochloric acid (pH 1.2) and 0.05 M acetate buffer (pH 4.6), were evaluated with dissolution apparatus (USP 1), 100 rpm rotation speed, and 900 ml dissolution medium volume. Dissolution profiling was performed over 120 min. Major phenolic compounds of gallic acid, catechin, epicatechin, and procyanidin B2 were quantitated to obtain the dissolution profile of GSE capsules, and trans-RSV was used for RSV capsules. Results indicated that the released trans-RSV for RSV capsules in both of the dissolution media meets the USP standards, and that for the GSE capsules, all the four marker compounds passed the dissolution test in the HCl medium but did not reach a 75% release within 60 min in the acetate buffer. These promising results suggest that the general USP dissolution protocols are adequate for the successful release of RSV capsules in HCl medium and acetate buffer and GSE capsules (in HCl medium), but may be inadequate for GSE capsules in acetate buffer. These results showed that under a low pH of 1.2 (simulated stomach environment), bioactive compounds were released on time from the GSE capsules and met the USP guidelines; however, under a higher pH of 4.6 (simulated duodenum environment), the same biomarkers failed, suggesting the need to further improve the dissolution of GSE over a wider range of pH environments to enhance bioavailability and efficacy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Lyu, Omar, Patel, Rodriguez, Ferruzzi, Pasinetti, Murrough, Muzzio, Simon and Wu."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "New Use Agriculture and Natural Plant Products Program, Department of Plant Biology and Center for Agriculture and Food Ecosystems, Institute of Food, Nutrition & Health, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, United States."}], "LastName": "Lyu", "ForeName": "Weiting", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Structured Organic Particulate Systems, Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, United States."}], "LastName": "Omar", "ForeName": "Thamer", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "New Use Agriculture and Natural Plant Products Program, Department of Plant Biology and Center for Agriculture and Food Ecosystems, Institute of Food, Nutrition & Health, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, United States."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Harna", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eagle Nutritionals, Carlstadt, NJ, United States."}], "LastName": "Rodriguez", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food, Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences, Plants for Human Health Institute, North Carolina State University, Kannapolis, NC, United States."}], "LastName": "Ferruzzi", "ForeName": "Mario G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center, James J.
