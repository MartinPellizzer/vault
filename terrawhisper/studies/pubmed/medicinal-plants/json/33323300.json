Alpinia oxyphylla Miq. (AO), Alpinia katsumadai Hayata (AK), Amomum villosum Lour. (FAL), Amomum villosum Lour. var. xanthioides T. L. Wu et Senjen (FALX), and Amomum longiligulare T. L. Wu (FALO). The fruits of these species are morphologically similar and commonly used in both foods and TCM. Each species is purportedly endowed with different medicinal properties. Efficient and environmentally friendly methods are desirable for the quality control of these species. The current study attempted to establish both comprehensive profiles and quality standards for the five TCM species. External morphology characters were provided to distinguish 18 fruit samples belonging to the five species, which were collected from different geographical regions of China. The VCs of each sample were analyzed by SPME GC/Q-ToF. The identification of marker compounds from each species allowed for the differentiation of the fruits from the five plants. Characterization and quantification of 21 TGs were achieved using SFC/MS with an analysis time of less than 15 min. The complex TGs were unambiguously identified using the MS detection with correct attribution of the acyl group to the sn-2 position. Moreover, the quantification of TGs was improved by using reference standards whenever possible or a single standard strategy to determine multiple TGs. The validity of the proposed SFC/MS method was assessed by analyzing fatty acids from the hydrolysis and transesterification products of the same sample set using GC/MS. The quantification results from both TGs and fatty acids were consistent, and were further substantiated by chemometric analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study utilizing the morphology, VCs, and TGs for quality evaluation purpose of these five TCM species."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, MS, 38677, USA; School of Pharmacy, Hainan Medical University, Haikou, 571199, China; Key Laboratory of Tropical Translational Medicine of Ministry of Education, Haikou, 571199, China; Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory for Research and Development of Tropical Herbs, Haikou, 571199, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Na", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products Utilization Research Unit, Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, University, MS, 38677, USA.
