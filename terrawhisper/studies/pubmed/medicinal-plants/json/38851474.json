In this study, a 6'-O-glucosyltransferase PpUGT7 (PpUGT91AH7) was functionally characterized from Paris polyphylla Smith var. yunnanensis (Franch.) Hand. -Mazz., which can transfer a glucosyl group to the C-6' position of diosgenin-3-O-rhamnosyl-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a02)-glucoside (1), pennogenin-3-O-rhamnosyl-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a02)-glucoside (2), and diosgenin-3-O-glucoside (5). The K<sub>M</sub> and K<sub>cat</sub> values of PpUGT7 towards the substrate 2 were 8.4\u00a0\u03bcM and 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Through molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis, eight residues were identified to interact with the sugar acceptor 2 and be crucial for enzyme activity. Moreover, four rare ophiopogonins and ginsenosides were obtained by combinatorial biosynthesis, including an undescribed compound ruscogenin-3-O-glucosyl-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a06)-glucoside (10). Firstly, two monoglycosides 9 and 11 were generated using a known sterol 3-O-\u03b2-glucosyltransferase PpUGT80A40 with ruscogenin (7) and 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (8) as substrates, which were further glycosylated to the corresponding diglycosides 10 and 12 under the catalysis of PpUGT7. In addition, compounds 7-11 were found to show inhibitory effects on the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in macrophages RAW264.7. The findings provide valuable insights into the enzymatic glycosylation processes in the biosynthesis of bioactive saponins in P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis, and also serve as a reference for utilizing UDP-glycosyltransferases to construct high-value or rare saponins for development of new therapeutic agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
