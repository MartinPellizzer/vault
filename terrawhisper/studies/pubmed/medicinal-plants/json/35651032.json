The phytochemical compositions of MeOH extracts were evaluated by UPLC-DAD-ESI-Q-TOF-MS<sup>n</sup> analysis. The in vitro antioxidant properties, enzymes inhibitory effects and nitric oxide (NO) production inhibitory activities of fractions obtained from the aerial parts of Althaea officinalis (APAO) were evaluated. The results identified 76 compounds, including 8 phenolic acids, 17 flavonoids, 6 coumarins, 9 triterpenes and 11 alkaloids. Fr. C-2 of APAO was found to have the highest TPC (175.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0mg GAE/g) and TFC (466.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.0\u00a0mg RE/g) with the highest antioxidant capacity in DPPH, ABTS, CUPRAC, FRAP and \u03b2-carotene bleaching assays. Fr. A showed noticeable inhibition of \u03b1-glucosidase with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 3.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. However, Fr. B displayed stronger inhibitory activity on 5-lipoxygenase than quercetin, with the IC<sub>50</sub> value of 8.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. In addition, Fr. B also possessed potent inhibitory activities on NO production toward LPS-activated RAW 264.7 Cells with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 15.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Our findings suggest that different Althaea officinalis extracts may be considered sources of phenolic and flavonoid compounds with high potential as natural antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents and blood sugar regulators. In addition, they can also be used in food and nutraceutical products with enhanced bioactivities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
