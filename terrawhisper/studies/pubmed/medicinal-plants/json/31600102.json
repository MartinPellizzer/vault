The rats were randomly allocated into four treatment groups: 1ml basal cream; tetracycline (3%); <i>Pimpinella anisum</i> 10% for 14 days; and a control group. At days seven, 14 and 21 post-injury, five animals of each group were euthanised, and wounds were assessed through gross, histopathological and oxidant/antioxidant evaluations. Additionally, the dry matter and hydroxyproline contents of the skin samples were measured.", "A total of 60 rats were used in the study. A significant decrease in the wound size was observed in treated animals with <i>Pimpinella anisum</i> compared with other groups during the experiment. Additionally, treatment with <i>Pimpinella anisum</i> decreased the number of lymphocytes and improved the number of fibroblasts at the earlier stages and increased a number of fibrocytes at the later stages of wound healing. Other parameters such as re-epithelialisation, tissue alignment, greater maturity of collagen fibres and large capillary-sized blood vessels revealed significant changes when compared with the control. <i>Pimpinella anisum</i> significantly reverted oxidative changes of total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde and glutathione peroxidase induced by diabetic wounds (p<0.05). Furthermore, it significantly increased the dry matter and hydroxyproline contents at various stages of wound healing (p<0.05).", "The present study showed that application of <i>Pimpinella anisum</i> extract promotes wound healing activity in diabetic rats. The wound-healing property of <i>Pimpinella anisum</i> can be attributed to the phytoconstituents present in the plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathobiology, Veterinary Medicine Faculty, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hashemnia", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Department of Clinical Sciences, Veterinary Medicine Faculty, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nikousefat", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammadalipour", "ForeName": "Adel", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4 Department of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "5 Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zangeneh", "ForeName": "Mohammad-Mahdi", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4 Department of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "5 Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zangeneh", "ForeName": "Akram", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Wound Care", "NlmUniqueID": "9417080", "ISSNLinking": "0969-0700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pimpinella"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31600102", "10.12968/jowc.2019.28.Sup10.S26"]}}]}
