However, no tests concerning the impact of TA on a biosynthetic pathway of this carotenoid pigment have been published so far. Thus, for the first time, the present preliminary study evaluated the influence of TA on the expression level of genes (crtOPQMN operon and aldH) encoding STX pathway enzymes. Additional attention was paid to the identification of STX and its intermediates. Gene expression and identification of extracted compounds were conducted using quantitative real-time PCR and HPLC-MS techniques, respectively. The analyzes showed no difference in crtM, crtN, crtO, crtP, crtQ, and aldH gene expression between bacterial samples isolated from the non-stimulated (control) medium and the stimulated one with TA. Compared to the control group that showed the presence of all metabolic intermediates and STX, the TA-treated bacteria were characterized by a lack or a significant reduction of the majority of compounds, except 4,4'-diaponeurosporenoate, the content of which was elevated in the TA-treated sample. Moreover, in silico molecular docking analysis revealed that TA is capable to create relatively strong interactions with both 4,4'-diapophytoene synthase and 4,4'-diapophytoene desaturase. The preliminary findings indicate that the previously observed TA effect reducing the number of S. aureus colonies pigmentation is probably not associated with the expression levels of genes encoding STX pathway enzymes. It has been proven that adding TA to the medium can interfere with the formation of STX at different levels of its biosynthetic pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
