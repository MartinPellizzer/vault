In this study, we used label-free quantitative proteomics analysis technology to investigate the effect of HMB on the protein expression of Humulus scandens (Lour.) Merr. leaves in July 2019 on Guiyang. A total of 269 proteins of 624 identified proteins were differentially expressed, among which 21.18% of the proteins were up-regulated and 32.71% down-regulated. These proteins were classified into 11 cell components and more than 20% of differentially expressed proteins were located in cell membrane and chloroplast. Functional classification analysis showed that 12 molecular functions were altered upon HMB treatment, and the ratio of catalytic activity was the highest (19.53%). At least 12 biological functions were affected, which involved small molecule metabolic processes, organic substance metabolic processes, gene expression, and photosynthesis. Our data provide resources and insights into the biochemical mechanism by which HMB kills weeds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
