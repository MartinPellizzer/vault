Leaves of stevia contain a non-caloric sweetener, stevioside, which is used as a substitute to artificial sweeteners. In August 2022, symptoms of chlorosis, wilting, and root rot were observed in about 30 % of stevia plants growing at the Agricultural Station at Yuma Agricultural Center, Yuma, AZ, USA (32.7125\u00b0 N, 114.7067\u00b0 W). Infected plants initially showed chlorosis and wilting, and the plants eventually died with foliage remaining intact to the plant. Cross sections of the crown tissue of affected stevia plants showed necrotic tissue and a dark brown discoloration in areas of the vascular and cortical tissues. Dark brown microsclerotia were observed on stem bases and necrotic roots of the infected plants. Five symptomatic plants were sampled to isolate the pathogen. Root and crown tissues (0.5 to 1 cm) were surface disinfested with 1% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min, rinsed three times with sterile water, and plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA). All the five isolates displayed rapid mycelial growth on PDA at 28\u00b0C with a 12-h photoperiod. The mycelia were initially hyaline and turned from gray to black after 7 days. Masses of dark spherical to oblong microsclerotia were observed after 3 days on PDA, measuring an average of 75 \u00b5m width \u00d7 114 \u00b5m length (n=30). For molecular identification, genomic DNA was extracted from mycelia and microsclerotia of a representative isolate (Yuma) using the DNeasy Plant Pro kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS), translation elongation factor-1\u03b1 (TEF-1\u03b1), calmodulin (CAL), and \u03b2-tubulin (\u03b2-TUB) regions were amplified using the primer sets, ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), EF1-728F/EF1-986R (Carbone and Kohn 1999), MpCalF/MpCalR (Santos et al. 2020), and T1/T22 (O'Donnell and Cigelink 1997), respectively. A BLAST search of sequences revealed 98.7 to 100% identity to Macrophomina phaseolina sequences (MK757624, KT261797, MK447823, MK447918). Both morphological and molecular characteristics confirmed the fungus as M. phaseolina (Holliday and Punithaligam 1970). Sequences were submitted in the GenBank under accession numbers OP599770 (ITS), OP690156 (TEF-1\u03b1), OP612814 (CAL), and OP690157 (\u03b2-TUB). Pathogenicity assay was performed on 9-week-old stevia plants (var. SW2267), grown in 4-inch planters in the greenhouse. The inoculum was made from a 14-day-old culture of M. phaseolina grown in conical flasks (250 ml) in potato dextrose broth at 28\u00b0C. Mycelial mats of the fungus were blended in 250 ml of sterile distilled water, filtered through four layers of cheesecloth, and then calibrated to 105 microsclerotia/ml using a hemocytometer. Twenty healthy plants were inoculated by soil drenching 50 ml of the inoculum per pot. Soil drenching using sterile distilled water was done on 5 non-inoculated control plants. Plants were maintained in the greenhouse at 28 \u00b1 3\u00b0C with 12 h photoperiod. After 6 weeks, necrosis at the base of petioles and chlorosis of the leaves, followed by wilting were noticed on all 20 inoculated plants, whereas all the 5 control plants remained healthy. The fungus was reisolated and identified as M. phaseolina based on the morphology and sequences of ITS, TEF-1\u03b1, CAL and \u03b2-TUB regions. Although M. phaseolina has been reported earlier on stevia in NC, USA (Koehler and Shew 2018), this is a first report from AZ, USA. M. phaseolina is known to be favored by high soil temperatures (Zveibil et al. 2011), thus represents a potential threat to stevia production in AZ, USA in coming years."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yuma County Cooperative Extension, University of Arizona, Yuma, Arizona, United States; neerajasingh@arizona.edu."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Neeraja", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Vision Bioenergy Oilseeds, Nampa, Idaho, United States; jeff.klingenberg@visionbioseeds.com."}], "LastName": "Klingenberg", "ForeName": "Jeff", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yuma County Cooperative Extension, University of Arizona, Yuma, Arizona, United States; bpoudel@email.arizona.edu."}], "LastName": "Poudel", "ForeName": "Bindu", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37157093", "10.1094/PDIS-03-23-0539-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
