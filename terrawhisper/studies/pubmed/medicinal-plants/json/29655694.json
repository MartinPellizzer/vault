(Acoraceae) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicinal plant, whose root are historically mainly used to treat neurodegenerative diseases, and for cholera treatment. This datum strongly indicates the antimicrobial activity of A. calamus.", "Our goal is to find the active constituents of A. calamus to treat dengue virus (DENV) infections, and to study the effects and mechanisms of these active substances.", "The root of A. calamus was extracted by ethanol. Mosquito larva C6/36 cells were used for DENV2 replication and transfection host. Mouse kidney fibroblast cells (BHK-21) were used as a host cell to study the infection ability of the virus. DENV2-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque assay were used to evaluate the inhibitory effect of A. calamus extracts on DENV2 infectivity inhibition. The levels of E and NS1 protein expression were measured by real-time PCR and western blot assays.", "12 compounds were isolated from ethanol extract of A. calamus root, tatanan A showed the best anti-DENV ability among these 12 compounds, which significantly alleviated DENV2-induced CPE and cytotoxicity effects, with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 3.9\u00a0\u00b5M. In addition, RNA replication assay further confirmed the antivirus ability of tatanan A. Time-addition assay showed that tatanan A affected the early stage of viral RNA replication, which in turn inhibited mRNA and protein levels of DENV2.", "These results demonstrated the anti-DENV2 effect of tatanan A, in inhibiting DENV2 RNA replication and infections. In summary, tatanan A was found to be a novel natural DENV inhibitor and a potential candidate for the treatment of DENV infectious disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier GmbH.
