By this new method, Mangiferin in F. mangiferae sampled in different months and in different regions was determinated.", "A RP-HPLC method was set up, using Shim pack CLC-ODS column, methanol-0.05 mol.L-1 H3PO4(65:134, pH 3.5) as mobile phase, with 258 nm of detection wave, at room temperature, 1 mL.min-1. F. mangiferae sampled in Nanning, Qinzhou and Tianyang, Guangxi province and sampled respectively in January to December were determinated.", "The average recovery of the RP-HPLC was 99.2%, RSD = 1.05% (n = 5). The content of Mangiferin in F. mangiferae was statistically different due to different sample-regions or sample-time.", "This RP-HPLC method is simple, specific and exact. The contents of Mangiferin in the leafs of F. mangiferae sample in Nanning and Tinayang were statistically similar, but higher than that in Qinzhou. The contents of Mangiferin in the leafs of F. mangiferae sampled in July to October were higher than that in the other months. The content in September was the highest, the content in February was the lowest."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Factory of Guangxi Traditional Chinese Medical University, Nanning 530023, Guangxi, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Hai-bin", "Initials": "HB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xue-jian", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ling", "ForeName": "Qiu-yun", "Initials": "QY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1M84LD0UMD", "NameOfSubstance": "mangiferin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mangifera"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthones"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15015377"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
