However, there is a scientific dearth on its antidiabetic activity.", "The antidiabetic effect of RPW and its possible mechanism of actions were investigated in diabetic rats.", "Four groups of male SD rats were first supplied with 10% fructose solution ad libitum for 2 weeks instead of drinking water followed by an intraperitonial injection of streptozotocin (40\u202fmg/kg) to induce diabetes. Two diabetic groups were administered RPW at 150 and 300\u202fmg/kg bodyweight (BW) respectively; a group was administered with metformin, while the other one was served as a negative control. Two groups of normal rats were administered with water and RPW (300\u202fmg/kg BW) and served as normal control and normal toxicology group, respectively.", "Five weeks treatment of RPW led to significant (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) increase in serum insulin and HDL-c levels with concomitant reduction in blood glucose, fructosamine, ALT, uric acid, triglycerides and LDL-c levels in diabetic rats. Rats treated with RPW had elevated levels of GSH, SOD, catalase, ATPase and \u03b1-amylase activities, while reduced NO level and myeloperoxidase activity was observed in their serum and pancreatic tissues. RPW also improved pancreatic \u03b2-cell function and restored \u03b2- and acinar cells morphology, and capillary networks. The activities of glycogen phosphorylase, fructose 1,6 biphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and acetylcholinesterase were also inhibited in RPW-treated diabetic rats, with concomitant down regulation of Nrf2 gene expression.", "The data of this study suggest that RPW modulates glucose homeostasis by enhancing insulin secretion as well as inhibiting redox imbalance in diabetic rats, which may be attributed to the synergetic effects of its phytochemical constituents as identified by GC-MS analysis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
