The two sequences (VfPEPCase1 and VfPEPCase2) have a sequence identity of 82 and 89% on the nucleotide and amino acid levels. The VfPEPCase1 mRNA was found to be predominantly expressed in roots and developing cotyledons whereas the VfPEPCase2 mRNA was more abundant in green and maternal tissues. In the cotyledons, PEPCase mRNAs accumulated from early to mid cotyledon stage and decreased thereafter. The PEPCase activity increased continuously during cotyledon development. The enzyme was strongly activated by glucose-6-phosphate, but not by glucose, fructose or sucrose. Asparagine was weakly activating whereas malate, aspartate and glutamate were inhibitory. The inhibitors became less effective with increasing pH. Aspartate was a much stronger inhibitor of cotyledonary PEPCase than glutamate at both pH 7.0 and 7.5. The sensitivity of PEPCase to malate inhibition decreased from early to mid cotyledon stage at a time when storage proteins are synthesized. This indicates activation on the protein level, possibly by protein phosphorylation. Nitrogen starvation in the presence of hexoses but not sucrose decreased mRNA levels of VfPEPCase1 and enzyme activity, indicating control on the mRNA level by both carbon and nitrogen. It is concluded that in developing cotyledons PEPCase is probably important for the synthesis of organic acids to provide carbon skeletons for amino acid synthesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Pflanzengenetik und Kulturpflanzenforschung (IPK), Gatersleben, Germany."}], "LastName": "Golombek", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Heim", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Horstmann", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wobus", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Weber", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["AJ011302", "AJ011303"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta", "NlmUniqueID": "1250576", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0935"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Primers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.31", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Primers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"QualifierName": ["embryology", "enzymology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10213002", "10.1007/s004250050535", "10.1007/s004250050535"]}}]}
