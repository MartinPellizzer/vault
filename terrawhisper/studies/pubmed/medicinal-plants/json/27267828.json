Gastrodin (GAS), a bioactive component of tianma, its pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior significantly changed after oral administration of DCXDCP compared with the extract of tianma. However, little is known about how the ingredients of chuanxiong influenced on the PK of GAS.", "To study the possible PK behavior differences of GAS after individually oral administration of tianma extract and tianma extract mixed with different active ingredients of chuanxiong to rats, as well as explore whether there were some herb-herb interactions.", "Different DCXDCP suspensions were prepared by mixing tianma extract with different active ingredients of chuanxiong. The rats were randomly assigned to six groups and were orally treated with different DCXDCP. At different predetermined time points after administration, the concentrations of GAS in the rat plasma were determined using HPLC, and the main PK parameters were investigated.", "The results showed that tetramethylpyrazine had no significant effects on the PK parameters of GAS (p>0.05), whereas ferulic acid (FA), total phenolic acids and total alkaloids significantly increased AUC0-\u221e (p<0.05). In general the observed changes in the PK parameters of GAS in DCXDCP could be closely related to the total phenolic acids and total alkaloids.", "It could be shown that total phenolic acids and total alkaloids present in Ligusticum chuanxiong in addition to other components not tested yet play an important role in affecting the PK of gastrodin in DCXDCP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
