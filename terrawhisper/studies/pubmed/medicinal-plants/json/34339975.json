All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro anticancer activity against various human cancer cell lines (lung (A549), prostate (PC3), breast (MCF-7), liver (HepG2), colon (HCT-116), ovarian (SKOV-3), skin (A431), brain (U251) and kidney (786-O)). 3-(4-Methoxy-3-(2-methoxypyridin-4-yl)phenyl)-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)azetidine-1-carbothioamide (3B) was found to be most potent member against PC3, U251, A431, and 786-O cancer cell lines with EC<sub>50</sub> values 0.25, 0.6, 0.03, and 0.03\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively and showed more potency than Doxorubicin in PC3, A431, and 786-O cell lines. Compounds 1B to 7B showed EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.03 to 12.55\u00a0\u00b5M in A431 cell line. Compound 3-(4-methoxy-3-(pyridin-4-yl)phenyl)-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)azetidine-1-carbothioamide (1B) was found to be highly efficient in A431 and 786-O cell line with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.77 and 0.73\u00a0\u00b5M respectively. All the compounds exhibited good to moderate cytotoxic activity. The pharmacophoric features and molecular docking studies confirmed the potentialities of compounds 1B, 2B, 3B and 5B to be VEGFR-2 inhibitors. Moreover, in silico ADMET prediction indicated that most of the synthesized compounds have drug-like properties, possess low adverse effects and toxicity. In addition, the DFT studies for the most active compounds (1B and 3B) were carried out. In the end, our studies revealed that the compounds 1B and 3B represent promising anticancer potentialities through their VEGFR-2 inhibition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
