Since most of the available therapies affect vital organs such as heart and liver, herbal remedies as a substitute therapy have been reported in several evidence-based studies.", "Medicinal plants exhibit a diverse range of bioactive elements known for their medicinal properties, such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antioxidant, and antimicrobial effects. Phytochemicals present in medicinal plants significantly trigger different signaling pathways, contributing to their therapeutic activities. This review covers a comprehensive summary of the therapeutic potential of an herbal diet in treating colorectal cancer and other ailments. Special attention will be given to exploring the interactions of medicinal plants with the microbiota and their associations with cancer pathways.", "A medicinal plant rich in bioactive compounds is a therapeutic option for colorectal cancer and potent cardioprotective and hepatoprotective agents. These bioactive compounds have demonstrated the ability to impede the growth of cancerous cells and trigger apoptosis. Our findings suggest that pomegranate, garlic, soybean, olive, green tea, papaya, and grapes are potential medicinal plants for combating cancer and related side effects. Bioactive compounds can modulate the gut microbiota's metabolism, and short-chain fatty acid production shows cardioprotective effects and reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. Hence, it can be stated that the interaction between a medicinal plant-rich diet and the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in preventing colorectal cancer and cardiac arrest."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9929-359X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, A-10, Sector-62, NOIDA, Uttar Pradesh, 201309, India."}], "LastName": "Tripathi", "ForeName": "Pankaj Kuamr", "Initials": "PK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9226-7719"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, A-10, Sector-62, NOIDA, Uttar Pradesh, 201309, India."}], "LastName": "Jain", "ForeName": "Chakresh Kumar", "Initials": "CK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Cardiovasc Hematol Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101266881", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5257"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37724674", "10.2174/1871525722666230915103747", "CHAMC-EPUB-134599"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
