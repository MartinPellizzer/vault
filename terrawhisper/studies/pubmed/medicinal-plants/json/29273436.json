The levels of biochemical indexes in tissues and serum and the activities of pepsin in gastric contents were measured after the sacrifice of rats. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells of the isolated compounds were determined.", "The studies indicated that A. argyi extract could exert strong protective effects on gastric mucosa in ethanol-induced rat model by regulating the levels of inflammatory factors, superoxide dismutase, and malonaldehyde, which were superior to those of positive control at 0.3g/mL. The isolated flavonoids could down-regulate the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines on LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells and eliminate free radicals in the anti-oxidative tests. The effects of eupatilin and jaceosidin, which were substituted by additional methoxy groups, were predominant, indicting the importance of methoxy to the activities.", "The results confirmed that A. argyi can protect ethanol-induced rats from gastric mucosal injury through inhibiting inflammatory responses and ameliorating oxidative stress. A. argyi is suitable for people with gastric mucosal injuries or unhealthy dietary habits as a necessary dietary supplement, which will promote the planting and application of A. argyi in both agriculture and food industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
