For the construction of the biaryl bond, mainly biomimetic oxidative coupling reactions were used, as shown for the natural products bismurrayaquinone-A, bis-2-hydroxy-3-methylcarbazole, clausenamine-A, and murrastifoline-F. For most of these compounds, a resolution of the respective atropo-enantiomers succeeded either directly, by high-performance liquid chromatography by HPLC on a chiral phase, or via atropo-diastereomers, after derivatization with a chiral auxiliary. The absolute configurations of the pure enantiomers were assigned by comparison of experimental (CD) spectra with those quantum chemi-cally calculated, or, for atropo-diastereomeric derivatives, by means of ROESY investigations and X-ray crystallography. Ullmann-type coupling conditions were also found to be feasible for the construction of the 2,2'-biscarbazole core, necessitating a completely regioselective 2-bromination protocol. The first atroposelective synthesis of such a basic target structure was achieved by application of the \"lactone methodology,\" giving rise to an atropisomeric ratio of 85 : 15. Some of the biscarbazole alkaloids and their derivatives were found to have interesting bioactivities, and for the first time, the natural atropo-enantiomeric ratio in the plants was determined for one of these compounds, murrastifoline-F."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2002 The Japan Chemical Journal Forum and Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Organische Chemie, Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg, Am Hubland, D-97074 W\u00fcrzburg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tasler", "ForeName": "Stefan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bringmann", "ForeName": "Gerhard", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Chem Rec", "NlmUniqueID": "101085550", "ISSNLinking": "1528-0691"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lactones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12001210", "10.1002/tcr.10014"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
