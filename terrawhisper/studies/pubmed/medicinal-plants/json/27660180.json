Different plant materials and chemicals have been tested, but few are both effective and practical. Medicinal herbs contain biological compounds and antimicrobials that may be effective in lowering the CH<sub>4</sub> production. However, few studies have systematically evaluated medicinal herbs for their effect on CH<sub>4</sub> production or on the rumen microbiota. In this study, extracts from 100 medicinal herbs were assessed for their ability to decrease CH<sub>4</sub> production by rumen microbiota in vitro. The extracts of 12 herbs effectively lowered the CH<sub>4</sub> production, with the extract of Perilla frutescens seeds being the most effective. The major components of P. frutescens seed extract were identified, and the effects of the extract on the fermentation characteristics and populations of rumen methanogens, fungi, protozoa, and select bacteria were also assessed. The decreased CH<sub>4</sub> production induced by the P. frutescens seed extract was accompanied by an increased abundance of Ruminobacter, Selenomonas, Succinivibrio, Shuttleworthis, Pseudobutyrivbrio, Anaerovibrio, and Roseomonas and a decreased abundance of Methanobrevibacter millerae. The abundance of Pedobacter, Anaeroplasma, Paludibacter, Ruminococcus, and unclassified Lachnospiraceae was positively correlated with the CH<sub>4</sub> production, with no effects on volatile fatty acids. This study suggests that medicinal herbs may be used to mitigate the CH<sub>4</sub> emission from ruminants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7213-3721"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IMoE Key Laboratory of Molecular Animal Nutrition, College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, People's Republic of China. jiakunwang@zju.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University, Yuhangtang Road 866#, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. jiakunwang@zju.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jiakun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IMoE Key Laboratory of Molecular Animal Nutrition, College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IMoE Key Laboratory of Molecular Animal Nutrition, College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yuelei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IMoE Key Laboratory of Molecular Animal Nutrition, College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IMoE Key Laboratory of Molecular Animal Nutrition, College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jianxin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory for Dairy Cow Nutrition, Beijing, 102206, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Linshu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Zhongtang", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Appl Microbiol Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8406612", "ISSNLinking": "0175-7598"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Microbiota"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Perilla frutescens"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Rumen"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ruminants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27660180", "10.1007/s00253-016-7830-z", "10.1007/s00253-016-7830-z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
