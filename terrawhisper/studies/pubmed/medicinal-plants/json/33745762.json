Previous studies have demonstrated their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cytoprotective effects.", "To evaluate their gastroduodenal antiulcer activity, gastric healing and toxicity in experimental models.", "Preventive antiulcer effects were assessed using oral pre-treatment on HCl/ethanol-induced gastric lesions and cysteamine-induced duodenal lesions models. Gastric healing, the underlining mechanisms and toxicity after repeated doses were carried out using the acetic acid-induced gastric ulcer rat model and oral treatment for 14 days.", "In the HCl/ethanol-induced gastric ulcer and cysteamine-induced duodenal injury, p-cymene and rosmarinic acid (50-200\u00a0mg/kg) decreased significantly the ulcer area, and so prevented lesions formation. In the acetic acid-induced ulcer model, both compounds (200\u00a0mg/kg) markedly reduced the ulcerative injury. These effects were related to an increase in the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and interleukin (IL)-10, and due to a decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, total and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Downregulation of factor nuclear kappa B (NF\u03baB) and enhanced expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)3 were also demonstrated. Furthermore, positive vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and cyclooxygenase (COX-2)-stained cells were increased in treated groups. Treatment also upregulated the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in gastric tissues. In isolated gastric epithelial cells this healing effect seems to be linked to a modulation of apoptosis, proliferation, survival and protein phosphorylation, such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Oral toxicity investigation for 14 days revealed no alterations in heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys weight nor the biochemical and hematological assessed parameters. p-Cymene and rosmarinic acid also protected animals from body weight loss maintaining feed and water intake.", "Data altogether suggest low toxicity, antiulcer and gastric healing activities of p-cymene and rosmarinic acid. Antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties seem to be involved in the curative effect as well as the induction of different factors linked to tissue repair."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
