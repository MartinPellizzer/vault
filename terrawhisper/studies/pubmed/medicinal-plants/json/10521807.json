Animals in the intermediate-exposure group (n = 10/gender/dose group) were killed after 6, 12 or 18 months of treatment, while those in the lifetime-exposure group (n = 54/gender/dose group) were killed when moribund or at the termination of the experiment at 24 months. Several tissues were processed for histopathological examination. The body weight and survival rate of mice fed pan masala were lower than that of the controls. Histopathological observations of tissues from control animals did not reveal any neoplastic alterations. However, lifetime feeding of pan masala induced adenoma of the liver, stomach, prostate and sebaceous glands, also forestomach papilloma, liver hamartoma, hepatoma and hemangioma, carcinoma of the forestomach, adenocarcinoma of the lung and liver, and testicular lymphoma. Neoplastic lesions appeared mainly in the liver (n = 13), stomach (n = 3) and lung (n = 8). Lung adenocarcinoma, the most frequent malignant tumor type, was observed in 2/120 mice in the intermediate-exposure group and in 8/216 animals in the lifetime-exposure group. Statistical analysis of tumor-induction data revealed a significant dose-related increase in lung adenocarcinomas but not in liver and stomach neoplasms indicating that lung is the major target tissue for the carcinogenic action of pan masala."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Carcinogenesis Division, Cancer Research Institute, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Mumbai, India."}], "LastName": "Bhisey", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ramchandani", "ForeName": "A G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "D'Souza", "ForeName": "A V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Borges", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Notani", "ForeName": "P N", "Initials": "PN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "0042124", "ISSNLinking": "0020-7136"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavoring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8R1V1STN48", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Catechin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Flavoring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Flour"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Food, Formulated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Precancerous Conditions"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spices"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10521807", "10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19991126)83:5<679::aid-ijc19>3.0.co;2-e", "10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19991126)83:5<679::AID-IJC19>3.0.CO;2-E"]}}]}
