Molecular docking, and MD simulations analysis showed the BHEPN's binding affinity and its potential as a VEGFR-2 inhibitor. ADMET assessments predicted BHEPN's safety and drug-like characteristics. In vitro investigations confirmed the inhibition of VEGFR-2 with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.320\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.012\u00a0\u00b5M. BHEPN also exhibited remarkable cytotoxic effects against HepG2 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0\u00b5M and 1.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively, outperforming Sorafenib's IC<sub>50</sub> values (2.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\u00a0\u00b5M and 3.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0\u00b5M), respectively. Notably, BHEPN displayed a higher IC<sub>50</sub> value of 4.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00\u00a0\u00b5M against the non-carcinogenic Vero cell lines, indicating selectivity index values of 21.6 and 3.4 against the tested cancer cell lines, respectively. In a flow cytometry assay, BHEPN induced HepG2 cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase. Moreover, BHEPN increased the incidence of early and late apoptosis in HepG2 cell lines (from 1.38% and 0.22%) in control cells to (4.11-26.02%) in the treated cells, respectively. Additionally, the percentage of necrosis raised to 13.39%, in contrast to 0.62% in control cells. Finally, BHEPN was able to reduce the migration and wound healing abilities in HepG2 cells to 38.89% compared to 87.92% in untreated cells after 48\u00a0h. These in vitro results aligned with the computational predictions, providing strong evidence of BHEPN's efficacy and safety in anticancer applications.", "BHEPN is a promising candidate for the development of novel anticancer agents through further in vitro and in vivo investigations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier GmbH.
