As a result, thirteen undescribed sesquiterpenes (chloranholosins A-M, 1-13), including ten acorane-type sesquiterpenes (1-10), one germacrene-type sesquiterpene (11), and two lindenane-type sesquiterpenes (12-13), together with fifteen known sesquiterpenes were isolated. Their structures and absolute configurations were elucidated by a comprehensive method including the spectroscopic data, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Chloranholosin L (12) was elucidated as a rare lindenane-type sesquiterpene featuring 14\u03b1-Me and 5-OH moieties. And chloranholosin M (13) was the first lindenane-type sesquiterpene possessing \u03b2-cyclopropane, 14\u03b1-Me, and 5\u03b2-H configuration from the family Chloranthaceae. Furthermore, twelve new isolates and some known sesquiterpenes were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Among them, compounds 12, 16, and 23 showed comparable inhibitory activity to that of the positive control, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 47.9, 41.5, and 48.3\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
