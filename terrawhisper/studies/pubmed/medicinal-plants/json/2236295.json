In order to characterize the active substances for anti-complementary and mitogenic activities, TJ-48 was fractionated. Anti-complementary activity was observed in the water- and methanol-insoluble fraction (F-2) and the crude polysaccharide fraction (F-5), whereas mitogenic activity was only found in F-5. However, other low molecular mass fractions did not show both activities. Methylation analysis indicated that F-2 mainly contained amylopectin-like polysaccharides. Both Pronase digestion and periodate oxidation decreased the anti-complementary activity of F-2, and the beta-amylase-resistant fraction of F-2 still retained the potent anti-complementary activity. When F-5, which has the most potent of both activities, was further fractionated, only the major acidic polysaccharide fraction, F-5-2, showed potent mitogenic activity. Endo-alpha-(1----4)-polygalacturonase digestion showed that F-5-2 mainly contained pectic polysaccharides, and the endo-polygalacturonase treatment of F-5-2 reduced the mitogenic activity but not the anti-complementary activity. F-2 and F-5 each activated the complement system by a different mode of action."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oriental Medicine Research Center of the Kitasato Institute, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kiyohara", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cyong", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Takemoto", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Komatsu", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kawamura", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aburada", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hosoya", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Complement Inactivator Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Complement Inactivator Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2236295", "10.1055/s-2006-960990"]}}]}
