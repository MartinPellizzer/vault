Due to their availability, low cost and low toxicity, research into potentially repurposing phytometabolites as therapeutic alternatives has gained attention. Therefore, this study explored the antiviral potential of metabolites of some medicinal plants [<i>Spondias mombin</i>, <i>Macaranga barteri</i> and <i>Dicerocaryum eriocarpum</i> (Sesame plant)] identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) as possible inhibitory agents against the S-2 main protease (S-2\u2009MP) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RP) using computational approaches. Molecular docking was used to identify the compounds with the best affinities for the selected therapeutics targets. Afterwards, compounds with poor physicochemical characteristics, pharmacokinetics, and drug-likeness were screened out. The top-ranked compounds were further subjected to a 120-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Only quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside (-48.77\u2009kcal/mol) had higher binding free energy than the reference standard (zafirlukast) (-44.99\u2009kcal/mol) against S-2\u2009MP. Conversely, all the top-ranked compounds (ellagic acid hexoside, spiraeoside, apigenin-4'-glucoside and chrysoeriol 7-glucuronide) except gnetin L (-24.24\u2009kcal/mol) had higher binding free energy (-55.19\u2009kcal/mol, -52.75\u2009kcal/mol, -47.22\u2009kcal/mol and -43.35\u2009kcal/mol) respectively, against S-2\u2009RP relative to the reference standard (-34.79\u2009kcal/mol). The MD simulations study further revealed that the investigated inhibitors are thermodynamically stable and form structurally compatible complexes that impede the regular operation of the respective S-2 therapeutic targets. Although, these S-2 therapeutic candidates are promising, further <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> and <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> evaluation is required and highly recommended.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
