With the development of complementary and alternative medicine, the interaction between herb and drugs has attracted more and more attention. Herb-drug interactions (HDI) could cause decreased efficiency, increased toxicity, and affect the drug absorption and disposition processes due to the interference of their pharmacological or pharmacokinetic effects. Hence, the mechanisms and results of herb-pharmacokinetic interactions should be comprehensively summarized. Here, we have summarized the mechanisms of HDI and pharmacokinetic interactions in the last ten years based on searching on PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science with different keywords. Besides, the pharmacokinetic interactions were related to nine commonly used herbs and drugs, including Ginseng, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Ginkgo biloba, Garlic, Coptis chinensis, St. John's wort, Ginger, Licorice, Silythistle and Fructus Schisandrae. This review provides an overview of HDI to provide a reference for the rational and safe clinical use of herbs and drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, No. 16, Nanxiao Street, Dongzhimen Nei, Dongcheng District, Beijing 100022, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Pharmacy, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Liangxiang University Town, Fangshan District, Beijing 100102, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Wenhao", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, No. 16, Nanxiao Street, Dongzhimen Nei, Dongcheng District, Beijing 100022, China."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Kexin", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, No. 16, Nanxiao Street, Dongzhimen Nei, Dongcheng District, Beijing 100022, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Siyang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, No. 16, Nanxiao Street, Dongzhimen Nei, Dongcheng District, Beijing 100022, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yingfei", "Initials": "Y"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CI2021B015 and CI2021A04909)", "Agency": "China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "ZXKT20031", "Agency": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Pharmacology and Safety Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "ZZ14-YQ-030", "Agency": "Outstanding Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Metab", "NlmUniqueID": "100960533", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herb-Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36650621", "10.2174/1389200224666230116113240", "CDM-EPUB-128864"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
