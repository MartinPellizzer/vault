The tool of choice for doing so remains serological tests that detect SARS-CoV-2 induced antibodies. However, the performance of these tests should be evaluated to ensure they comply with the specific performance criteria desired by each country that they are used in.", "Here, we use pre-COVID-19 plasma and plasma from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals collected in 2020, 2021 and 2022 to evaluate the performance of two commercial Rapid Lateral Flow (RLF) tests (the PANBIO\u2122 COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test and the LABNOVATION\u2122 COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG/IgM rapid test) and one commercial ELISA test (the PLATELIA\u2122 SARS-CoV-2 total Ab).", "We find that whereas the specificity of the two RLF tests is \u2265 95%, it was 91% for the ELISA tests. However, at 14 days post-COVID-19 date of diagnosis (DoD), only the ELISA test constantly achieved a sensitivity of \u226580% over all the three years. In addition, the rate of detection of the two RLF tests varied across the years with a sensitivity ranging from <80% in 2021 to >80% in 2022. More importantly the capacity of these two RLF tests to detect IgG antibodies decreased with time. On the contrary, the sensitivity of the ELISA test was still above 80% more than six months post DoD.", "We recommend that sero-epidemiological surveys focused on testing antibodies should not rely on performances reported by the assay manufacturers. They should include a formal evaluation of the selected assays to ensure its limitations and strengths conform with the data-accuracy requirements of the surveys."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Research on Emerging and Re-Emerging Diseases (CREMER), Institute of Medical Research and Studies of Medicinal Plants (IMPM), Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Kenfack", "ForeName": "Dell-Dylan", "Initials": "DD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, The University of Yaound\u00e9 I, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Nguefack-Tsague", "ForeName": "Georges", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Science, The University of Yaound\u00e9 I, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Biotechnological Center, The University of Yaound\u00e9 I, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Penlap", "ForeName": "Veronique B", "Initials": "VB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Research on Emerging and Re-Emerging Diseases (CREMER), Institute of Medical Research and Studies of Medicinal Plants (IMPM), Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Maidadi", "ForeName": "Martin F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Research on Emerging and Re-Emerging Diseases (CREMER), Institute of Medical Research and Studies of Medicinal Plants (IMPM), Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Godwe", "ForeName": "Celestin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Science, The University of Yaound\u00e9 I, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Njayou", "ForeName": "Nico F", "Initials": "NF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Biotechnological Center, The University of Yaound\u00e9 I, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Bigoga", "ForeName": "Jude D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fondation Congolaise pour la Recherche M\u00e9dicale, Brazzaville, People's Republic of Congo."}], "LastName": "Ntoumi", "ForeName": "Francine", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Research on Emerging and Re-Emerging Diseases (CREMER), Institute of Medical Research and Studies of Medicinal Plants (IMPM), Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Mpoudi-Ngole", "ForeName": "Eitel", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Research on Emerging and Re-Emerging Diseases (CREMER), Institute of Medical Research and Studies of Medicinal Plants (IMPM), Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Tongo", "ForeName": "Marcel", "Initials": "M"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "107752", "Acronym": "WT_", "Agency": "Wellcome Trust", "Country": "United Kingdom"}, {"GrantID": "EDCTP_CSA2020NOE-3100", "Acronym": "EDCTP_", "Agency": "European &#x26; Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP)", "Country": "Netherlands"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Clin Virol Plus", "NlmUniqueID": "9918283581506676", "ISSNLinking": "2667-0380"}, "CoiStatement": "Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Park GS, et al.
