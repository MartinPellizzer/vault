In Morocco, aromatic and medicinal plants are widely used to calm these pains and eliminate their symptoms. Among these plants, Artemisia campestris L. which is used in eastern Morocco to treat digestive system problems.", "Our study aimed to experimentally verify the traditional use of this plant by evaluating the myorelaxant and antispasmodic effects of the essential oil of Artemisia campestris L. (EOAc).", "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry analysis (GC-MS) was performed to identify the compounds present in the EOAc. Then, these molecules were subjected to the in silico study for molecular docking. The myorelaxant and antispasmodic evaluation of the EOAc were tested in vitro on an isolated rabbit and rat jejunum mounted on an organ bath. Then, an isotonic transducer connected to an amplifier recorded the graph related to intestinal contractility.", "GC-MS analysis of the essential oil of Artemisia campestris L. showed the presence of m-Cymene (17.308%), Spathulenol (16.785%), \u03b2 Pinene (15.623%), \u03b1 Pinene (11.352%), \u03b1.-Campholenal (8.848%) as main constituents. The EOAc gave a dose-dependent and reversible myorelaxant effect on the spontaneous contractions of jejunum isolated from rabbits, with an IC<sub>50</sub> equal to 72.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.93\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. This effect did not occur through adrenergic receptors. The EOAc has an antispasmodic effect on the contractions of rat jejunal induced by a medium with low (25\u00a0mM) or high concentration (75\u00a0mM) of KCl, and carbachol 10<sup>-6</sup>\u00a0M. The obtained inhibitory effects are comparable to those of a non-competitive antagonist of cholinergic receptors. The major compounds of EOAc allowed the establishment of a relationship between these phytoconstituents and the antispasmodic effect found by the EOAc. The obtained results are also supported by a docking study.", "The obtained results confirm favorably the use of Artemisia campestris L. in traditional Moroccan medicine for the treatment of digestive tract illness, which gives us a new route to valorize the effects obtained by a phytomedicine specific for the digestive tract."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
