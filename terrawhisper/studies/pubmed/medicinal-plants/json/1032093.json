Toledo). In addition to its strong inhibitory activity against trypsin the purified inhibitor presented a lesser activity against alpha-chymotrypsin. The purification of the protein inhibitor was achieved from the crude extract of deffated seeds through ammonium sulphate salting-out, successive chromatographies on Sephadex G-75 and DEAE-Sephadex A-50 columns followed by preparative polyacrylamide-slab electrophoresis. The following properties were presented by the purified inhibitor: molecular weight of 12,000 daltons, as estimated by gel filtration; isoelectric point at pH 5.0 - 5.2, by electrofocusing; combining molar ratio of 1:1 (mole trypsin/mole inhibitor), on the basis of inhibition assay and the molecular weight of 29,800 daltons found for the trypsin-inhibitor complex; A1%1-cm = 4.35, at 275 nm and pH 7.0. The inhibitor presents a high content of cystine (14 cystinyl residues per molecule) and is entirely devoid of methionine, tryptophan and free sulhydryl groups. The fluorescence spectra are typical for tyrosine with a strong quenching of emission indicated by the quantum yield. The circular dichroism spectra suggest a predominantly unordered structure for the inhibitor molecule."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mizuta", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ventura", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "An Acad Bras Cienc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503280", "ISSNLinking": "0001-3765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1976", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1032093"]}}]}
