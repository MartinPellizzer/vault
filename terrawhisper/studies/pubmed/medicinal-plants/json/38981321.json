Medicinal herbs, with a history of thousands of years in clinical use, contain versatile polysaccharides as one of their primary compounds. This review offers an overview of the antiviral effects of polysaccharides from medicinal herbs on viruses in humans, poultry, swine and aquaculture in recent years. The mechanism of these antiviral polysaccharides, involved in hindering various stages of the viral life cycle thereby blocking virus infection, is summarized. The review also explores other underlying mechanisms of antiviral effects, such as enhancing the immune response, regulating inflammatory reactions, balancing gut flora, reducing oxidative stress, and suppressing apoptosis through various corresponding signaling pathways. The structure-function relationships discussed in this article also aid in understanding the antiviral mechanism of natural polysaccharides, indicating the need for more in-depth research and analysis. Natural polysaccharides from medicinal herbs have emerged as valuable resources in the fight against viral infections, exhibiting high effectiveness. This review emphasizes the promising role of polysaccharides from medicinal herbs as potential candidates for blocking viral infections in humans and animals."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
