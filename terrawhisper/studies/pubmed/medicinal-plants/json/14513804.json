A complex polysaccharide (AMP-B) was isolated and purified on DEAE-cellulose column. The model of diabetes rats was established with alloxan injection through the tail vein. Male rats were divided into 5 groups: the normal group, the control group, and three AMP-B-fed groups.

The neutral polysaccharide content of AMP-B was 50.3%, uronic acid was 40.4%, and protein was 11.5%. Monosaccharide composition of AMP-B was determined by GC, AMP-B composed of Glc, Gal, Man, Ara and Rha in a molar ratio of 3.0:2.5:1.3:3.5:1.0. AMP-B was found to reduce blood glucose level in alloxan-diabetic rats markedly at doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg.kg-1 by ig, but no effect in normal rat. AMP-B was found to decrease the consumption of water and food, recover pancreas damage of diabetic rats obviously, inhibited the atrophy of thymus and pancreas of the diabetic rats induced by alloxan.", "AMP-B showed significant hypoglycemic effect on the experimental hyperglycemias rats induced by alloxan."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bio-organic and Natural Product Chemistry, Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Science, Shanghai 200032, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shan", "ForeName": "Jun-jie", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Geng-yuan", "Initials": "GY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pancreas"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Thymus Gland"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14513804"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
