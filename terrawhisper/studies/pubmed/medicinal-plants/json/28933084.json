After searching the transcriptome dataset of P. carinatus, one unique sequence encoding 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase was discovered. The primers were designed according to the cDNA sequence of 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase from the dataset. And then, the open reading frame (ORF) of 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase, named as PcHDR1 (GenBank Accession number\uff1aJQ957845), was cloned by RT-PCR strategy with the template of mixed RNA extracted from roots, stem and leaf of P. carinatus. The bioinformatic analysis of this gene and its corresponding protein was performed. The ORF of PcHDR1 consisted of 1 437 base pairs (bp), encoding one polypeptide with 478 amino acids. The sequence comparison showed that PcHDR1 is closest with GbHDR (Ginkgo biloba),and the sequence homology was up to 78%. Bioinformatics prediction and analysis indicated that PcHDR1 protein contained a conserved domain of LytB, without transmembrane region and signal peptides. This study cloned and analyzed 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase from P. carinatus. The result will provide a foundation for exploring the function of PcHDR1 involved in terpene biosynthesis in P. carinatus plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Institute of Medicinal Plants/Endangered Medicinal Breeding National Engineering Laboratory, Beijing 100193, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture and Gardening, Yangtze University, Jingzhou 434025, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhi-Li", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Institute of Medicinal Plants/Endangered Medicinal Breeding National Engineering Laboratory, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Hai-Zhou", "Initials": "HZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Institute of Medicinal Plants/Endangered Medicinal Breeding National Engineering Laboratory, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Institute of Medicinal Plants/Endangered Medicinal Breeding National Engineering Laboratory, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Liu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Institute of Medicinal Plants/Endangered Medicinal Breeding National Engineering Laboratory, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Jing-Yuan", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Institute of Medicinal Plants/Endangered Medicinal Breeding National Engineering Laboratory, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Institute of Medicinal Plants/Endangered Medicinal Breeding National Engineering Laboratory, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Hong-Mei", "Initials": "HM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computational Biology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Lycopodiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28933084", "10.4268/cjcmm20162214"]}}]}
