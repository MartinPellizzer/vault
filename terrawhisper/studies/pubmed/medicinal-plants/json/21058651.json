Here, the Arabidopsis transcription factor Production of Anthocyanin Pigment 1 (AtPAP1) was expressed in S. miltiorrhiza and improved the antioxidant capacity in transgenic plants up to 3-fold. Salvianolic acid B (Sal B) biosynthesis was strongly induced (10-fold higher) in 1 month old transgenic plantlets, a growth stage not normally characterized by significant levels of phenolic acids. This high-Sal B phenotype was stable in roots during vegetative growth, with tissues accumulating approximately 73.27 mg/g of dry weight. Total phenolics, total flavonoids, anthocyanin, and lignin were also significantly enhanced. Consistent with these biological and phytochemical changes, expression of phenolic acid biosynthetic genes was stimulated. Our results demonstrate that AtPAP1 has an additional, previously unknown, role as a transcriptional activator of phenolic acid biosynthesis in S. miltiorrhiza. The results provide a promising strategy for engineering phenolics production in economically significant medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710062, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Ya-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhe-Zhi", "Initials": "ZZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Arabidopsis Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "PAP1 protein, Arabidopsis"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pancreatitis-Associated Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "REG3A protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I3P9R8317T", "NameOfSubstance": "phenolic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pancreatitis-Associated Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21058651", "10.1021/jf103203e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
