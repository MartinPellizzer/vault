Rosmarinus officinalis, L. (Lamiaceae) has a therapeutic potential against hepatotoxicity due to its antioxidant activity. Objective The objective of this study is to investigate the phytochemical analysis of the methanol extract of Rosmarinus officianalis leaves (MEROL) and its efficacy against CTX-induced hepatotoxicity. Materials and methods The phytochemical analyses were assessed spectrophotometericaly. To assess the MEROL efficacy, 72 Swiss albino mice were divided into six groups. Group 1 was control, groups 2 and 3 included mice which were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100 or 200\u2009mg/kg of MEROL at days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 and 16; group 4 was injected (i.p.) with CTX (200\u2009mg/kg) at day 17, groups 5 and 6 were injected (i.p.) with MEROL as groups 3 and 4 followed by 200\u2009mg/kg CTX at day 17, respectively. At day 22, six mice from each group were sacrificed and the others were sacrificed at day 37. Results MEROL has a high content of total phenolics, saponins, total antioxidant capacity and DPPH radical scavenging activity. The median lethal dose (LD50) value of MEROL was 4.125\u2009g/kg b.w. The inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) value for DPPH radical scavenging was 55\u2009\u03bcg/mL. Pretreatment with 100\u2009mg/kg MEROL for 16 d ameliorated CTX-induced hepatotoxicity represented in lowering the levels of the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lipid profile and minimizing the histological damage. Conclusions Pretreatment with 100\u2009mg/kg b.w. MEROL mitigated CTX-induced hepatotoxicity due to its antioxidant activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biology, College of Science , Aljouf University , Sakaka , Saudi Arabia ;"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science , Tanta University , Tanta , Egypt ;"}], "LastName": "El-Naggar", "ForeName": "Sabry A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biology, College of Science , Aljouf University , Sakaka , Saudi Arabia ;"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Botany, Faculty of Science , Aswan University , Aswan , Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abdel-Farid", "ForeName": "Ibrahim B", "Initials": "IB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biology, College of Science , Aljouf University , Sakaka , Saudi Arabia ;"}], "LastName": "Germoush", "ForeName": "Mousa O", "Initials": "MO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biology, College of Science , Aljouf University , Sakaka , Saudi Arabia ;"}], "LastName": "Elgebaly", "ForeName": "Hassan A", "Initials": "HA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science , Tanta University , Tanta , Egypt ;"}], "LastName": "Alm-Eldeen", "ForeName": "Abeer A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812552", "ISSNLinking": "1388-0209"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8N3DW7272P", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclophosphamide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "etiology", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclophosphamide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lethal Dose 50"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rosmarinus"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrum Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26828825", "10.3109/13880209.2015.1137954"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
