For (+)-Clau, it was mainly metabolized to 4-hydroxy-Clau, whereas 7-hydroxy- and 4-hydroxy-Clau were so small that they could not be detected systematically. 4-Hydroxylation of (+)-Clau showed highest Vmam/K(m) value (0.547 microL.min-1.mg-1) among all the metabolites tested, which was 8.0 times higher than that of 4-hydroxylation of its antipode.", "The data indicated that there were obvious substrate stereoselective differences in the hydroxylation metabolism of (+)- and (-)-Clau, which provided an explanation of the difference of pharmacokinetic characteristics of Clau enantiomers in rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Chuan-jiang", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jun-tian", "Initials": "JT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactams"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "103541-15-7", "NameOfSubstance": "clausenamide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "53-59-8", "NameOfSubstance": "NADP"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lactams"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lignans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NADP"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rutaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14730912"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
