It is extensively predominant in temperate and sub-temperate regions of the world. The essential oil of this species is enriched with broad aroma constituents extensively utilized in food, beverages, flavor, cosmetics, perfumery, and pharmaceutical enterprises. With the global menthol market size estimated to be worth USD 765 million in 2022, India (accompanied by China and Brazil) is the world's primary manufacturer, consumer, and exporter of <i>Mentha</i> oil. Despite prominent global demand, the crucial bottleneck in mint cultivation is the need for more superior commercial cultivars. Predominant vegetative propagation mode with difficulties in manual emasculation, differential blooming times, sterile/sub-sterile hybrids, and low seed viability are the primary containment in creating genetic variability by classical breeding approaches. Therefore, genetic complications encountered in conventional breeding have led the breeders to apply mutation breeding as an alternative crop improvement approach in <i>Mentha</i> spp. These attempts at mutation breeding have produced some distinctive mutants as genetic pools for plant breeding programs, and some novel mutant mint cultivars have been made available for commercial cultivation.", "The prime strategy in mutation-based breeding has proven an adept means of encouraging the expression of recessive genes and producing new genetic variations. The present review comprises a significant contribution of mutation breeding approaches in the development of mutant mint species and its effects on physiological variation, photosynthetic pigment, essential oil content and composition, phytochemical-mediated defense response, pathogen resistivity, and differential expression of genes related to terpenoid biogenesis. Development and diversification have led to the release of varieties, namely Todd's Mitcham, Murray Mitcham, Pranjal, Tushar, and Kukrail in <i>M. piperita</i> L., Mukta, and Pratik in <i>M. cardiaca</i> Baker, Neera in <i>M. spicata</i> L., Kiran in <i>M. citrata</i> Ehrh., and Rose mint in <i>M. arvensis</i> L. that have revolutionized and uplifted mint cultivation leading to economic gain by the farmers and entrepreneurs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Seed Quality Lab, Plant Breeding & Genetic Resource Conservation Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India."}], "LastName": "Prasad", "ForeName": "Priyanka", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Seed Quality Lab, Plant Breeding & Genetic Resource Conservation Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Akancha", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Seed Quality Lab, Plant Breeding & Genetic Resource Conservation Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Vagmi", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4588-5140"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Seed Quality Lab, Plant Breeding & Genetic Resource Conservation Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Birendra", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Radiat Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8809243", "ISSNLinking": "0955-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1490-04-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Menthol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mentha"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Menthol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37755121", "10.1080/09553002.2023.2263595"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
