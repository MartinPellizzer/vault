Gelatinization temperature and peak viscosity were found to be independent of amylose content as well as protein and amino acid contents. The maximum volume-expansion ratio was positively correlated with amylose content and independent of protein and amino acid contents. Seed coats of the tested varieties were very fine and seemed to be an unimportant factor for their cookability. No correlation was found between phytic acid phosphorus content and cookability of the tested varieties. The amino acids were determined quantitatively by the amino acid analyser. Glutamic acid was found in higher level, whereas the other amino acids were found in variable amounts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "El-Saied", "ForeName": "H M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "El-Shirbeeny", "ForeName": "A E", "Initials": "AE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Z Ernahrungswiss Suppl", "NlmUniqueID": "0413633", "ISSNLinking": "0084-5337"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gels"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viscosity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Nature. 1960 Mar 19;185:823-5", "ArticleIdList": ["14437797"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem J. 1939 Oct;33(10):1660-1680.1", "ArticleIdList": ["16747083"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Clin Nutr. 1969 Oct;22(10):1315-22", "ArticleIdList": ["4981186"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6945762", "10.1007/BF02021565"]}}]}
