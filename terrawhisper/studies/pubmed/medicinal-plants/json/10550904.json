During gradual dose escalation, more adverse events occurred at the lower dose range. The hazard rate of systemic adverse events was highest among HIV-positive patients. Drug-related adverse events were flu-like symptoms and transient exacerbations of gingivitis, fever, and eosinophilia. An increase of serum urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels occurred, as did a slight decrease in total protein caused by a minor fall in albumin concentrations. Dose dependence was apparent for inflammation and fever, which may or may not have been side effects of the preparation.", "Viscum album Qu FrF can be administered safely to HIV-positive patients.
