In the present investigation, methanol fraction of these leaves were analysed by GC/MS that revealed the presence of 25 compounds. The anti-leptospiral activity of methanol crude extract was determined by both microdilution and macrodilution methods. The MICs of the extract were tested against 24 pathogenic leptospiral strains and ranged between 62.5-125\u00a0\u03bcg/mL in both microdilution and macrodilution. The range of MBCs was 250 and 500\u00a0\u03bcg/mL in macrodilution and microdilution respectively. The crude extract was subjected to cytotoxic studies and found to have negligible or no haemolytic activity, exhibiting IC50 values of greater than 4\u00a0mg/mL. Further in vivo studies are needed to investigate the pharmacological and toxicological properties of Boesenbergia rotunda, before it can be considered as a new anti-leptospiral agent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Regional Medical Research Centre (ICMR), WHO Collaborating Centre for Diagnosis, Reference, Research and Training in Leptospirosis , P.O.
