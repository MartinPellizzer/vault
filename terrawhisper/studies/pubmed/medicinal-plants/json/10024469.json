We have developed an indirect immunoaffinity chromatography system for the purification of cognate proteases from the same source, based on preferential high salt elution of the enzyme from a ternary complex of the protease, the inhibitor, and the anti-inhibitor IgG. Using anti-winged bean chymotrypsin inhibitor (WbCI) IgG as an affinity ligand, a multicatalytic protease complex has been purified from developing winged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus) seeds. The purified preparation resolves into two large proteolytically active components when subjected to gel permeation chromatography under nondenaturing conditions, while SDS/PAGE analysis shows the presence of approximately 15 polypeptide chains in the 20- to 115-kDa range. The preparation cleaves known synthetic peptide substrates of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and V8 protease and it is only partially inhibited by a number of class-specific protease inhibitors. Western blot analysis shows the presence of WbCI in the purified preparation even after its extensive removal by the IgG-Sepharose column. The versatility of the indirect immunoaffinity chromatography system is attested by its extension to the soybean seeds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 1999 Academic Press."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemical Engineering Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4, Raja S.
