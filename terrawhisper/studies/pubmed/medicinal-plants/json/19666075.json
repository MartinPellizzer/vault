However most of the screenings are usually conducted on an ad hoc basis and not systematically. The initial purpose of this review was to screen plants with neurological bioactivity, in particular those that have not been fully studied and that have molecular mechanisms whose active constituents responsible for the activity remain to be identified. The second purpose was to identify potential target plants for future studies of new and alternative therapies for the treatment of neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. All plants considered in this review were selected for three qualities: possible molecular requirements to act at the CNS; representative of the main classes of compounds with the referred bioactivity and the major families containing species with those compounds; and diffuse world distribution. We identified several examples of plants that have potential for further study. We have included the main families of these plants, their known molecular mechanisms involved in neurological bioactivity, and the active constituents responsible for such activity. Also included is a brief discussion about the requirements of the different compounds to reach the CNS. These requirements may be less limited than what researchers have previously thought."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Pharmaceutical Studies, Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Coimbra, Polo III, Azinhaga de Santa Comba, Coimbra, Portugal. goncalomortagua@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gomes", "ForeName": "Nelson G M", "Initials": "NG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Campos", "ForeName": "Maria G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Orf\u00e3o", "ForeName": "Jo\u00e3o M C", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ribeiro", "ForeName": "Carlos A F", "Initials": "CA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry", "NlmUniqueID": "8211617", "ISSNLinking": "0278-5846"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Blood-Brain Barrier"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "126"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19666075", "10.1016/j.pnpbp.2009.07.033", "S0278-5846(09)00262-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
