Plants like Tecoma stans, Manilkara zapota and Cassia fistula were some which had the ability to heal the wounds. However, there was limited research in Cassia fistula flowers and its synergism with plants on wound healing and its mechanism. Qualitative analysis was performed to confirm the presence of phytoconstituents like flavonoids, saponins and tannins in solvents:aqueous ethanol and methanol. All three components showed their attributes towards wound healing. Results of antimicrobial activity clearly stated that, methanol extract of the Cassia fistula flowers at increasing concentration, showed the maximum zone of inhibition of 27\u00a0mm at 100\u00a0\u03bcl (antibacterial assay) and 18\u00a0mm at 100\u00a0\u03bcl (anti-fungal assay). They had higher potential against the selective microbes Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus niger. The combination of C. fistula flowers and C. fistula leaves; C. fistula flowers and M. zapota leaves showed maximum zone of inhibition of 23\u00a0mm and 21\u00a0mm for anti-bacterial; 22\u00a0mm and 23\u00a0mm for antifungal at 100\u00a0\u03bcl respectively. The C. fistula flowers along with the Manilkara zapota leaves and C. fistula leaves enhanced the antimicrobial nature than the individual plants. The antimicrobial properties present in the plants would engage them in future for developing an improved medicine for wound healing. Thus a polyherbal plant solution containing equal proportions of plants, tested for the antibacterial activity, succeeded by showing its higher inhibition of 25\u00a0mm at 100\u00a0\u03bcl.This concluded that the synergism of plants had higher efficiency in microbial activity than the individual samples hence proving the plants attributes towards the wound healing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
