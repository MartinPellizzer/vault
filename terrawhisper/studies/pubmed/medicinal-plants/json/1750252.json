Anecdotal reports were given directly linking specified methods of chewing the nut with asthma aggravation, in some cases indicating dose-response (toxicity) relationships. While more elaborate and objective studies are being undertaken, it is hereby suggested that patients with asthma be cautioned against chewing betel nut."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Papua New Guinea, Port Moresby."}], "LastName": "Kiyingi", "ForeName": "K S", "Initials": "KS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Papua New Guinea", "MedlineTA": "P N G Med J", "NlmUniqueID": "0376417", "ISSNLinking": "0031-1480"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mastication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Outpatient Clinics, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Papua New Guinea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1750252"]}}]}
