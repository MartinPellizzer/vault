Adverse events such as liver injury have been reported during the clinical application of PRP. The purpose of the study is to explore the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> metabolic activation of PRP. Two GSH conjugates were detected in rat liver microsomal incubations containing PRP, GSH, and NADPH. The two GSH conjugates were both obtained from the bile of rats and rat primary hepatocytes after exposure to PRP. Similar microsomal incubations complemented with <i>N</i>-acetylcysteine (NAC) in place of GSH offered two NAC conjugates. As expected, the NAC conjugates were detected in the urine of PRP-treated rats. One of the two NAC conjugates was identified as NAC conjugate <b>12</b> verified by chemical synthesis. The individual human recombinant P450 enzyme incubation assay demonstrated that CYP1A2 dominated the catalysis for the metabolic activation of PRP. Pretreatment with \u03b1-naphthoflavone (NTF) decreased the formation of PRP-derived GSH conjugates in both livers of rats and cultured primary hepatocytes after being treated with PRP. Additionally, NTF was found to decrease the susceptibility of primary hepatocytes to the cytotoxicity of PRP. The findings indicate that PRP was metabolized to the corresponding epoxide, which could participate in PRP-induced cytotoxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110016, P.R.
