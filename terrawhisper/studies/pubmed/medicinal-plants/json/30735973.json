A greenhouse experiment was executed to evaluate the effect of biochar (BC) amended Cd and Pb spiked soil on their immobilization and uptake, plant growth, photosynthetic attributes (total chlorophyll, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and stomatal activity) and oxidative enzymes (guaiacol peroxidase: POD; catalase: CAT and superoxide dismutase: SOD). In the present study, the photosynthetic attributes showed that BC significantly improved the total chlorophyll, photosynthetic, transpiration rates, and stomatal activity in the plants. The incorporation of BC in soil increase the Pb and Cd tolerance in M. arvensis vis-\u00e0-vis improved the biomass yield and nutrient intake. In addition, biochar has also reduced the POD, CAT, and SOD in the plant as well as improved the soil pH and enzymatic activities. Overall, BC immobilized the Cd and Pb in soil by providing the binding site to the metals and reduced the phytotoxicity in M. arvensis. However, large-scale field trials of BC are required for safe cultivation of M. arvensis which is known for its phytopharmaceuticals importance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
