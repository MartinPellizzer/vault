In this study, the antihyperglycemic activity of chloroform and methanol fractions (CF and MF) from S. securidaca seed extract was investigated and their bioactive constituents were identified. The antidiabetic effects of fractions were assessed by streptozocin-induced diabetic Naval Medical Research Institute mice. The hypoglycemic activity of MF at 100\u00a0mg/kg and CF at 400\u00a0mg/kg was comparable with glibenclamide (3\u00a0mg/kg). MF at 400\u00a0mg/kg and CF at 600\u00a0mg/kg showed equal hypoglycemic responses to 12.5\u00a0IU/kg insulin (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Three cardiac glycosides were isolated as active constituents responsible for the hypoglycemic activity. Securigenin-3- O -\u03b2-glucopyranosyl-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a04)-\u03b2-xylopyranoside (1) was a major compound in seeds. Securigenin-3- O -inositol-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a03)-\u03b2-glucopyranosyl-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a04)-\u03b2-xylopyranoside (2) and securigenin-3- O -\u03b1-rhamnopyranosyl-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a04)-\u03b1-glucopyranoside (3) were found as new natural products. When 1-3 were tested at 10\u00a0mg/kg there was a significant reduction of blood glucose levels in diabetic mice, comparable to that of 3\u00a0mg/kg glibenclamide (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The hypoglycemic effect was due to an increase in insulin secretion; the insulin levels in the diabetic mice significantly improved and were comparable with those in healthy animals (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Compounds responsible for the hypoglycemic properties of S. securidaca seeds were identified as cardiac glycosides and were found to act via an increase of insulin levels in a diabetic mouse model."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy and Medicinal Plant Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 14174-14411, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tofighi", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Basel, Klingelberg Strasse 50, 4056, Basel, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Moradi-Afrapoli", "ForeName": "Fahimeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Basel, Klingelberg Strasse 50, 4056, Basel, Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, G.
