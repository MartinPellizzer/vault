The present study explored the effects of different associated bryophyte species on the yield and quality of D. nobile to clarify the dominant bryophyte species associated with D. nobile and to provide a scientific basis for the rational cultivation and quality evaluation of D. nobile.", "The growth of D. nobile was closely related to the microenvironment of the Danxia stone, and the different associated bryophytes had different effects on D. nobile growth. There was a rich variety of bryophytes associated with D. nobile, with a total of 15 families, 24 genera and 31 species of bryophytes identified in the study area, including 13 families, 22 genera and 29 species of mosses and 2 families, 2 genera and 2 species of liverworts, and mosses predominated in the association with D. nobile. Usually, 3-9 species of bryophytes were growing in association with D. nobile, among which associations of 5-6 bryophytes species were more common, and the bryophytes associated with D. nobile were only related to the species to which they belonged. The dry matter accumulation, quality and mineral content of D. nobile differed significantly among different bryophyte species. The coefficients of variation of dry matter accumulation, dendrobine content and content of 11 mineral elements of D. nobile in the 35 sample quadrats were 25.00%, 21.08%, and 11.33-57.96%, respectively. The biomass, dendrobine content and mineral content of D. nobile were analysed by principal component analysis (PCA) and membership function. The results showed that each evaluation method initially screened Trachycystis microphylla and Leucobryum juniperoideum as the dominant associated bryophytes in the preliminary identification analysis, and the frequency of occurrence and coverage of the two bryophytes were significantly higher than those of the remaining bryophytes. It was determined that T. microphylla and L. juniperoideum were the dominant associated bryophytes.", "There is a rich variety of bryophytes associated with D. nobile. The yield and quality of D. nobile differed significantly among different bryophyte species. T. microphylla and L. juniperoideum were the dominant associated bryophytes, and were the two bryophytes associated with D. nobile through mixed growth."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023.
