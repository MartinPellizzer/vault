(Rutaceae): A Review.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Medicinal plants play a crucial role in traditional medicine, where they are extensively employed by traditional physicians for treating a wide array of ailments. Limonia acidissima (Linn), commonly known as the Wood apple and belonging to the Rutaceae family, is widely cultivated in countries, such as Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka. The various parts of Limonia acidissima, including its roots, leaves, fruits, stem, and even the whole plant, have been traditionally used in the treatment of numerous conditions, such as constipation, diarrhea, dysentery, skin diseases, asthma, astringent, diabetes, jaundice, and dyspepsia and act as diuretic agents, cardiotonic, cardiac stimulant, and hepato-protectant. Extensive research has revealed that Limonia acidissima possesses a rich chemical composition, including quinones, lignans, flavonoids, sterols, coumarins, alkaloids, triterpenoids, phenolic acids, and volatile oils, present in its stem, leaves, fruits, stem bark, and roots. These chemical constituents contribute to its diverse therapeutic properties. In recent years, numerous studies have explored the ethanopharmacological properties of Limonia acidissima extracts, highlighting their anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-diarrheal, antimicrobial, antiulcer, wound healing, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antibacterial, antifungal, larvicidal, neuroprotective, antispermatogenic, antihistaminic, diuretic, and adsorbent activities. This comprehensive review focuses on the traditional uses, biological activities, and phytoconstituents isolated from different parts of Limonia acidissima Linn. The gathered information provides valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of this plant, serving as a foundation for further research and the development of novel pharmaceuticals. The integration of traditional knowledge with scientific evidence enhances the understanding of the medicinal properties of Limonia acidissima, fostering its utilization in modern medicine and healthcare systems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6665-3432"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences & Technology, Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi, Jharkhand 835 215, India."}], "LastName": "Mohanty", "ForeName": "Satyajit", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2931-9042"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences & Technology, Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi, Jharkhand 835 215, India."}], "LastName": "Pattnaik", "ForeName": "Ashok", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Comb Chem High Throughput Screen", "NlmUniqueID": "9810948", "ISSNLinking": "1386-2073"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "21"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "21"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38676498", "10.2174/0113862073285538240417051928", "CCHTS-EPUB-139974"]}}]}
