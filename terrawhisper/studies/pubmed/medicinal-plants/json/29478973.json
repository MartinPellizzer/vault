Productive cough should be not suppressed; instead, mucus-dissolving agents are recommended. One of the expectorants, which increases the excretion volume, is the herbal medicine derived from ivy leaves. The ivy extract contains triterpene saponins, which have secretory properties. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness and safety of the treatment with the medicinal product Hedussin\u00ae, containing dry ivy extract, in the therapy of productive cough in the course of the respiratory tract infection.", "Material and methods:This was a non-randomized, non-interventional, multicenter, open-label, post-authorization effectiveness study (PAES). The study group consisted of 464 patients aged 2-12 years with productive cough. The study was supported by a questionnaire that included: the type of cough etiological factor, Bronchitis Severity Score (BSS), temperature, and prescription of antibiotic therapy. Effectiveness and safety of the therapy with Hedussin\u00ae was assessed at the follow-up visit.", "Results and conclusion: Improvement in cough was reported in 93.3% subjects; improvement in chest pain on coughing was reported in 84.7%, in wheezing - in 90.0%, in dyspnoea - in 88.7%, and in auscultation changes - in 94.8%. In addition, decline or normalization of body temperature was found in 96.0% of subjects. No adverse drug reactions were reported in the study population. The non-antibiotic treated group showed similar proportions. The results of this study support the efficacy of Hedussin\u00ae prescribed for the treatment of productive cough in the course of respiratory tract infections. Hedussin\u00ae was well tolerated by sick children aged 2-12 years."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Scientific Information, Phytopharm Kl\u0119ka Inc."}], "LastName": "Sch\u00f6nknecht", "ForeName": "Karina", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Care Organization And Economy, National Institute of Public Health, National Institute of Hygiene, Warsaw, Poland, Clinical Department of Internal Medicine and Allergology, Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of Interior and Administration, Warsaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Fal", "ForeName": "Andrzej M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Family Medicine, Medical University, Wroc\u0142aw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Mastalerz-Migas", "ForeName": "Agnieszka", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Scientific Information, Phytopharm Kl\u0119ka Inc."}], "LastName": "Joachimiak", "ForeName": "Monika", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Allergology and Pneumonology, National Research Institute for Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, Rabka Zdroj Branch, Rabka-Zdr\u00f3j, Poland."}], "LastName": "Doniec", "ForeName": "Zbigniew", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Multicenter Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Wiad Lek", "NlmUniqueID": "9705467", "ISSNLinking": "0043-5147"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cough"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hedera"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29478973"]}}]}
