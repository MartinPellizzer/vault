Globally, CAIDs remain one of the leading causes of disability and morbidity. Despite playing a leading therapeutic role, the vast profusion of anti-inflammatory synthetic agents have not been able to fully resolve a panoply of CAIDs. Additionally, contemporary synthetic therapy approaches remain bounded by a wide array of limitations essentially being adverse effects and unaffordable costs. In this advent, the use of herbal products provides an interesting avenue to explore in view of developing such treatment regimens.", "This review article endeavors to highlight potential herbal products and isolated phytochemicals which can be of benefit in the prophylaxis, management, and treatment alongside avoiding the relapse of CAIDs.", "This review article has highlighted that herbals, herbal products, and isolated metabolites hold a huge potential in the prophylaxis, management, and treatment of CAIDs. Herbals can act on various targets involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders. In addition, novel approaches for the management of CAIDs are numerous. Indeed, nanoparticles loaded with phytochemicals have been developed to specifically target the colon for IBD treatment. In silico approaches using herbals also offer unlimited avenues to decipher new pharmacophores. Investigating the potential of polyherbal formulations is another unique approach which can be investigated. Given the inefficacy of conventional medicines, the concomitant use of conventional and herbal medicines can also be explored."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Mauritius, 230 Reduit, Mauritius."}], "LastName": "Suroowan", "ForeName": "Shanoo", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Mauritius, 230 Reduit, Mauritius."}], "LastName": "Mahomoodally", "ForeName": "Fawzi", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Comb Chem High Throughput Screen", "NlmUniqueID": "9810948", "ISSNLinking": "1386-2073"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Autoimmune Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29436996", "10.2174/1386207321666180213093449", "CCHTS-EPUB-88509"]}}]}
