Plants harbor one or two endophytic microbes capable of synthesizing metabolite compounds. Environmental factors determine the plant growth and survival as well as the kind of microorganisms associated with them. Some fungal endophytes that symbiotically colonize the endosphere of medicinal plants with the potential of producing biological products have been employed in traditional and modern medicine. The bioactive resources from endophytic fungi are promising; biotechnologically to produce cheap and affordable commercial bioactive products as alternatives to chemical drugs and other compounds. The exploration of bioactive metabolites from fungal endophytes has been found applicable in agriculture, pharmaceutical, and industries. Thus, fungal endophytes can be engineered to produce a substantive quantity of pharmacological drugs through the biotransformation process. Hence, this review shall provide an overview of fungal endophytes, ecology, their bioactive compounds, and exploration with the biosystematics approach."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7707-8816"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Security and Safety Niche Area, Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, North-West University, Mmabatho, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Adeleke", "ForeName": "Bartholomew Saanu", "Initials": "BS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4344-1909"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Security and Safety Niche Area, Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, North-West University, Mmabatho, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Babalola", "ForeName": "Olubukola Oluranti", "Initials": "OO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Genet Eng Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "8510274", "ISSNLinking": "0264-8725"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fungi, Unclassified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "37"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34666635", "10.1080/02648725.2021.1991714"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
