Accumulation of such metabolites often occurs in plants subjected to stresses including various elicitors or signal molecules. Throughout evolution, endophytic fungi, an important constituent in the environment of medicinal plants, have known to form long-term stable and mutually beneficial symbiosis with medicinal plants. The endophytic fungal elicitor can rapidly and specifically induce the expression of specific genes in medicinal plants which can result in the activation of a series of specific secondary metabolic pathways resulting in the significant accumulation of active ingredients. Here we summarize the progress made on the mechanisms of fungal elicitor including elicitor signal recognition, signal transduction, gene expression and activation of the key enzymes and its application. This review provides guidance on studies which may be conducted to promote the efficient synthesis and accumulation of active ingredients by the endogenous fungal elicitor in medicinal plant cells, and provides new ideas and methods of studying the regulation of secondary metabolism in medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy , Second Military Medical University , Shanghai , China."}], "LastName": "Zhai", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy , Second Military Medical University , Shanghai , China."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy , Second Military Medical University , Shanghai , China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy , Second Military Medical University , Shanghai , China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Cheng-Jian", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Physiological Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences , Liverpool John Moores University , Liverpool , UK."}], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "Khalid", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy , Second Military Medical University , Shanghai , China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy , Second Military Medical University , Shanghai , China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Lu-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8914274", "ISSNLinking": "1040-841X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Secondary Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27936989", "10.1080/1040841X.2016.1201041"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
