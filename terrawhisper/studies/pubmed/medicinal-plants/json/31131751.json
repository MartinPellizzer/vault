However, PPAR\u03b3 is also emerging as an important therapeutic target for varied disease states other than type 2 diabetes like neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, spinal cord injury, asthma, and cardiovascular problems. Furthermore, glitazones, the synthetic thiazolidinediones, also known as insulin sensitizers, are the largely studied PPAR\u03b3 agonists and the only ones approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, they are loaded with side effects like fluid retention, obesity, hepatic failure, bone fractures, and cardiac failure; which restrict their clinical application. Medicinal plants used traditionally are the sources of bioactive compounds to be used for the development of successful drugs and many structurally diverse natural molecules are already established as PPAR\u03b3 agonists. These natural partial agonists when compared to full agonist synthetic thiazolidinediones led to weaker PPAR\u03b3 activation with lesser side effects but are not thoroughly investigated. Their thorough characterization and elucidation of mechanistic activity might prove beneficial for counteracting diseases by modulating PPAR\u03b3 activity through dietary changes. We aim to review the therapeutic significance of PPAR\u03b3 for ailments other than diabetes and highlight natural molecules with potential PPAR\u03b3 agonistic activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Bioengineering and Biosciences, Lovely Professional University (LPU), Phagwara, Punjab - 144411, India."}], "LastName": "Shafi", "ForeName": "Sana", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University (LPU), Phagwara, Punjab - 144411, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Research and Development, Lovely Professional University (LPU), Phagwara, Punjab - 144411, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Pawan", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University (LPU), Phagwara, Punjab - 144411, India."}], "LastName": "Khatik", "ForeName": "Gopal Lal", "Initials": "GL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Bioengineering and Biosciences, Lovely Professional University (LPU), Phagwara, Punjab - 144411, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Jeena", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "100960531", "ISSNLinking": "1389-4501"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "PPAR gamma"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["agonists", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "PPAR gamma"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31131751", "10.2174/1389450120666190527115538", "CDT-EPUB-98626"]}}]}
