Here, the effects of dietary administration of agrimony on streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic mice and on in vitro glucose uptake and glucose metabolism, and on insulin secretion by BRIN-BD11 cells were investigated. Agrimony incorporated into the diet (62.5 g/kg) and drinking water (2.5 g/l) countered the weight loss, polydipsia, hyperphagia and hyperglycaemia of STZ-diabetic mice. Aqueous extract of agrimony (1 mg/ml) stimulated 2-deoxy-glucose transport (1.4-fold), glucose oxidation (1.4-fold) and incorporation of glucose into glycogen (2.0-fold) in mouse abdominal muscle comparable with 0.1 microM-insulin. In acute 20 min tests, 0.25-1 mg/ml aqueous extract of agrimony evoked a stepwise 1.9-3.8-fold stimulation of insulin secretion from the BRIN-BD11 pancreatic B-cell line. This effect was abolished by 0.5 mM-diazoxide and previous exposure to extract did not adversely affect subsequent stimulation of insulin secretion by 10 mM-L-alanine, thereby indicating that there was no detrimental effect of the extract on cell viability. The effect of extract was glucose-independent and was not evident in BRIN-BD11 cells exposed to a depolarizing concentration of KCl. The ability of agrimony extract to enhance insulin secretion was dependent on use of heat during extract preparation. These results demonstrate the presence of antihyperglycaemic, insulin-releasing and insulin-like activity in Agrimony eupatoria."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulster, Coleraine, UK. youngheartsproject@hpsspop.n-i.nhs.uk"}], "LastName": "Gray", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Flatt", "ForeName": "P R", "Initials": "PR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0372547", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["diet therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Insulin Secretion"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Islets of Langerhans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9797650", "10.1017/s0007114598001834"]}}]}
