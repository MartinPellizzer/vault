Main constituents of the essential oil from the autumn material were found to be 1b,5,5,6a-tetramethyl-octahydro-1-oxa-cyclopropa [a] inden-6-one (7.32%); methyl linolenate (4.14%); cubenol (5.97%); 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (10.87%); delta-9(10)-tetrahydrocostunolide-1-keto (35.51%). Seventy-two peaks were identified from spring material, representing 79.88% of the total oil. Main constituents of the essential oil from the spring material were found to be caryophyllene (3.315%); ethylbenzene (3.523%); 3-hexen-1-ol (4.537%); 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (6.513%); 5-propionyl-2-chlorobenzeneacetic acid, methyl ester (8.541%), germacrene D (12.311%).", "The same compounds in both materials are as follows: 2,2-dimethyl-6-methylene-cyclohexanepropanol; 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol; 3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadien-3-ol; cubenol; docosane and eicosane.
