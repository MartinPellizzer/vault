Our preliminary screening showed that St. John's Wort (SJW) displayed potent inhibition on pancreatic lipase (PL), a key hydrolase responsible for lipid digestion and absorption in mammals. Herein, the inhibition potentials and inhibitory mechanism of SJW extract and its major constituents on PL were fully investigated by a set of in vitro and in silico studies. The results clearly demonstrated that the naphthodianthrones, biflavones and most of flavonoids in SJW displayed strong to moderate inhibition on PL. Among all tested natural compounds, two naphthodianthrones (hypericin and pseudohypericin) and one biflavone (I3,II8-biapigenin) isolated from SJW exhibited potent PL inhibition activity, with the IC<sub>50</sub> values of <1\u00a0\u03bcM. Inhibition kinetics analyses showed that hypericin, pseudohypericin and I3,II8-biapigenin inhibited PL via a mixed manner, while molecular dynamics simulations revealed that three newly identified PL inhibitors could bind on PL at both the catalytic cavity and the interface between colipase and the C-terminal domain of PL. Collectively, our findings suggested that part of major constituents in SJW displayed potent PL inhibition activities, which could be used as lead compounds for the development of novel PL inhibitors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
