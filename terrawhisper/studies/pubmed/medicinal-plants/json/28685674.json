Yet, medicinal plants were mainly gathered from the wild, resulting in some of the commonly used herbs becoming endangered species. Also, in many cases, the activity and biochemical profile of plants harvested over different time spans and ecosystems may vary. Rational cultivation may ensure optimized yield with a uniform high quality of products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Israel Plant Gene Bank, ARO Volcani Center, Rishon LeZion, Israel."}], "LastName": "Mayzlish-Gati", "ForeName": "Einav", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Sciences, Agriculture Research Organization, Volcani Center, Rishon LeZion, Israel."}], "LastName": "Fridlender", "ForeName": "Marcelo", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Sciences, Agriculture Research Organization, Volcani Center, Rishon LeZion, Israel."}], "LastName": "Nallathambi", "ForeName": "Rameshprabu", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Sciences, Agriculture Research Organization, Volcani Center, Rishon LeZion, Israel."}], "LastName": "Selvaraj", "ForeName": "Gopinath", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Science, School of Biological Sciences, Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Nadarajan", "ForeName": "Stalin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Sciences, Agriculture Research Organization, Volcani Center, Rishon LeZion, Israel."}], "LastName": "Koltai", "ForeName": "Hinanit", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle East"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28685674", "10.2174/0929867324666170705113129", "CMC-EPUB-84512"]}}]}
