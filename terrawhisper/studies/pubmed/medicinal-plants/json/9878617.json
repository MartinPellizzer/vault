Capped RNA was about five times more infectious than uncapped RNA as determined by a local lesion assay. The SBMV-C cDNA clone was also used for mutagenesis of the four SBMV-C open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1, ORF3, and coat protein (CP) mutants were not infectious in cowpea. Electroporation of cowpea protoplasts with mutant transcripts demonstrated that the ORF1, ORF3, and CP gene products were not required for SBMV-C RNA synthesis, and the ORF1 and ORF3 gene products were not required for SBMV-C assembly. From these results, it was concluded that the ORF1 and ORF3 proteins and the CP are required for SBMV-C cell-to-cell movement. One of the ORF3 mutants pSBMV2-UAA1833 contained a nonsense codon between the predicted -1 ribosomal frameshift site (SBMV-C nucleotides 1796-1802) and a potential ORF3 translation initiation codon at SBMV-C nucleotide 1895. The lack of infectivity of this mutant suggested that ORF3 was expressed by a -1 ribosomal frameshift in ORF2 rather than by initiation of translation at nucleotide 1895."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 1998 Academic Press."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Center for Legume Research, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37996-0845, USA."}], "LastName": "Sivakumaran", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fowler", "ForeName": "B C", "Initials": "BC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hacker", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM50350", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Virology", "NlmUniqueID": "0110674", "ISSNLinking": "0042-6822"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Viral Movement Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electroporation"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "pathogenicity", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Movement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Open Reading Frames"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Viral Movement Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Protoplasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Viral Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9878617", "10.1006/viro.1998.9489", "S0042-6822(98)99489-2"]}}]}
