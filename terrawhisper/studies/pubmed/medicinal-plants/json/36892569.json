The present study is designed to systematically investigate the enzymatic interaction of XTT with CYP1A2, along with pharmacokinetic alteration of tacrine resulting from the co-administration of XTT. The results showed that XTT induced a time-, concentration-, and NADPH-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, and the inhibition was irreversible. Co-incubation of glutathione (GSH) and catalase/superoxide dismutase was unable to prevent enzyme inactivation. Nevertheless, competitive inhibitor fluvoxamine exhibited a concentration-dependent protective effect against the XTT-induced CYP1A2 inactivation. A GSH trapping experiment provided strong evidence for the production of epoxide or/and \u03b3-ketoenal intermediates resulting from the metabolic activation of XTT. Furthermore, pretreatment of rats with XTT was found to significantly increase the <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> and area under the curve of plasma tacrine relative to those of tacrine administration alone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou 550004, P.
