The rich and varied topographic environment of the Yinshan Mountains has created a variety of vegetation floras, which also makes the species of medicinal plant resources in this area unevenly distributed. Therefore, studying the spatial distribution difference of medicinal plant resources among various banners, counties, and districts in the Yinshan area is of great significance to formulate the protection policy and promote the industry development of medicinal plant. This study is based on the fourth national survey of traditional Chinese medicine resources in Inner Mongolia, regarding the results of the third national survey of traditional Chinese medicine resources. The species of medicinal plant resources in the Yinshan area around 31 banners, counties and districts were counted in detail. Then, using exploratory spatial data analysis(ESDA), trend surface analysis, spatial autocorrelation, geographical detector and other geostatistical analysis methods to analyze the differences in the spatial distribution of medicinal plant resources of the Yinshan area in Inner Mongolia. After discussing and analyzing the experimental results to account for the reasons for the overall trend of change and the degree of aggregation, the author further put forward relevant constructive suggestions. The results show that the areas with the most abundant and concentrated distribution of medicinal plant resources in the Yinshan area are located in Guyang county, Shiguai District of Baotou city, Tutou right banner, and Tuoketuo county; the higher richness and concentrated distribution of medicinal plant resources is in Wulate front banner, Wulate middle banner, Wulate back banner; areas with relatively low abundance and concentrated distribution of medicinal plant resources located in Qingshan district of Baotou city, Saihan district and Yuquan district of Hohhot city; areas with the lowest abundance and concentrated distribution of medicinal plant resources are located in Xincheng district and Huimin district of Hohhot city. It can be concluded that the horizontal distribution difference of multiple ecological factors, the special wetland environment of the river, the vertical difference of elevation, the farmland and other factors have an important influence on the richness of the medicinal plant resources species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baotou Medical College Baotou 014040, China."}], "LastName": "Ming-Xu", "ForeName": "Zhang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhi-Xian", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Ting-Ting", "ForeName": "Shi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inner Mongolia Medical University Hohhot 010110, China."}], "LastName": "Bao-Chang", "ForeName": "Zhou", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baotou Medical College Baotou 014040, China."}], "LastName": "Chun-Hong", "ForeName": "Zhang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao-Bo", "ForeName": "Zhang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baotou Medical College Baotou 014040, China Inner Mongolia Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Hohhot 010020, China Inner Mongolia Medical University Hohhot 010110, China."}], "LastName": "Min-Hui", "ForeName": "L I", "Initials": "LI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33350229", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200802.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
