We have retrospectively reviewed 211 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma which were confirmed by histopathological examination at Kaohsiung Medical College Hospital in the period between 1987 and 1991. There were 194 males and 17 females, with a male to female ratio of 11.4 to 1. The age of the patients ranged from 23 to 95 years, mean 51.96 years, with the greatest incidence of disease in the ages between 40 and 59 years (63.3%). Squamous cell carcinoma occurred most often on the buccal mucosa. There were 40.8% of cases which occurred on the buccal mucosa, 25.6% on the tongue, 17.1% on the gingiva of mandible, 9.5% on the maxilla, 5.2% on the lower lip and 1.9% on the floor of mouth. 195 cases with a recorded history of habits in the patient's medical records were evaluated for the relationships between habits, patient's age and the location of the tumor involved. We have used a general factorial ANOVA to examine the relationship of habits and patients' age. A Hierarchical Loglinear Analysis was used to determine whether there was an association between habits and the location of tumor involved. Of the 195 cases, 144 (73.85%) chewed betel nut regularly. The mean age of the patients with betel nut chewing habits (49.04 years) was significantly younger than that of the patients without betel nut chewing habits (59.27 years) (p = 0.006).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Kaohsiung Medical College, Taiwan, Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "G S", "Initials": "GS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China (Republic : 1949- )", "MedlineTA": "Gaoxiong Yi Xue Ke Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8603880", "ISSNLinking": "0257-5655"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7494240"]}}]}
