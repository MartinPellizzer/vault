(family Apocynaceae), often referred to as the wild snakeroot plant, is an important medicinal plant and produces a number of indole alkaloids in its seeds and roots. The plant is often used as a substitute for Ravuolfia serpentine (L.) Benth. ex Kurz known commonly as the Indian snakeroot plant or sarphagandha in the preparation of Ayurvedic formulations for a range of diseases including hypertension. In this study, we examine the spatial localization of the various indole alkaloids in developing fruits and plants of R. tetraphylla using desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI). A semi-quantitative analysis of the various indole alkaloids was performed using UPLC-ESI/MS. DESI-MS images showed that the distribution of ajmalcine, yohimbine, demethyl serpentine and mitoridine are largely localized in the fruit coat while that for ajmaline is restricted to mesocarp of the fruit. At a whole plant level, the ESI-MS intensities of many of the ions were highest in the roots and lesser in the shoot region. Within the root tissue, except sarpagine and ajmalcine, all other indole alkaloids occurred in the epidermal and cortex tissues. In leaves, only serpentine, ajmalcine, reserpiline and yohimbine were present. Serpentine was restricted to the petiolar region of leaves. Principal component analysis based on the presence of the indole alkaloids, clearly separated the four tissues (stem, leaves, root and fruits) into distinct clusters. In summary, the DESI-MSI results indicated a clear tissue localization of the various indole alkaloids, in fruits, leaves and roots of R. tetraphylla. While it is not clear of how such localization is attained, we discuss the possible pathways of indole alkaloid biosynthesis and translocation during fruit and seedling development in R. tetraphylla. We also briefly discuss the functional significance of the spatial patterns in distribution of metabolites."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
