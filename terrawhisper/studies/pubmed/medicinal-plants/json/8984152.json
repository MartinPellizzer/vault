The PMTA from antirrinoside contained an 8-alpha-OAc group from the opened 7,8-epoxide moiety. Treatment of genipin, the aglycone of geniposide, with HCl(g) and NH3(g) yielded the PMTA racemigerine, a known plant isolate, in which the C=C-CH2OH side chain was converted to C=C-CH3. Reaction of geniposide with beta-glucosidase and aqueous NH4OAc led to oligomeric alkaloids, but at high dilution a dimer was obtained whose structure was formally that of a Diels-Alder adduct between racemigerine and a dihydropyridine. These biomimetic semisyntheses were analyzed in terms of reaction mechanisms and the relative paucity of known plant PMTAs in comparison with the multitudinous occurrence of their presumed iridoid glycoside precursors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523-1872, USA."}], "LastName": "Frederiksen", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stermitz", "ForeName": "F R", "Initials": "FR"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM49631", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pyridines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8984152", "10.1021/np960026x", "np960026x"]}}]}
