(Sapindaceae) is used as a medicinal herb by the tribes of Shola forest regions of Western Ghats. It is used for headaches, backaches, stomach pain, piles and simple ulcers. The present study was performed to evaluate the gastroprotective effect and acute toxicity of this plant in various experimental models.", "Studies were performed in two different models (ethanol and indomethacin induced gastric ulcer) in wistar rats. Gastric protection was evaluated by measuring the ulcer index, gastric glutathione assay, alkaline phosphate assay and histopathological studies. Gastric secretion studies were done by pyloric ligation experiment.", "Water and ethanol extract (500 mg/kg body weight) showed moderate activity compared to hexane extract. Hexane extract of Dodonaea viscosa dose dependently inhibited ethanol induced gastric lesions, causing 90% protection at 500 mg/kg, 81% protection at 250 mg/kg, and 70% protection at 125 mg/kg and it also dose dependently inhibited indomethacin induced gastric lesions, causing 92% protection at 500 mg/kg, 77% protection at 250 mg/kg, and 52% protection at 125 mg/kg. The various degrees of inhibition were statistically significant (p<or=0.05). Further in our gastric secretion studies, we found that hexane extract of Dodonaea viscosa (500 mg/kg) decreased the amount of total acid in gastric juice. Dodonaea viscosa hexane extract thus inhibits acid secretion to prevent ulcer aggravation. Acute toxicity study with a higher dose of 1250 mg/kg did not manifest any toxicological signs in rats. We also performed preliminary phytochemical screening of the crude extract which gave positive results for the presence of flavanoids, saponins, bitter principles and phenols."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Ethnopharmacology Lab, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arun", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Asha", "ForeName": "V V", "Initials": "VV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XXE1CET956", "NameOfSubstance": "Indomethacin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Indomethacin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Sapindaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18603387", "10.1016/j.jep.2008.05.026", "S0378-8741(08)00273-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
