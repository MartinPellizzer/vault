Don\u00a0is a perennial herb in the Araceae family. It is native to South Asia and the Asia-Pacific and has long been cultivated as it is an economically important medicinal and ornamental plant. During July 2012 and 2013, severe outbreaks of leaf spot and stem rot disease on this plant occurred in a greenhouse of Shunyi district, in Beijing,\u00a0China\u00a0(117\u00b005'E, 40\u00b013'N). The disease incidence was greater than 30%. The leaf spots first appeared as yellow dots. As lesions expanded, the symptoms were circular to subcircular, light brown lesions with darker brown edges, Around the lesions the leaf tissue was chlorotic causing the formation of a yellow halo (Suppl. Fig1). Initial symptoms on the stems were brown, round or fusiform spots . As the disease progressed, lesions enlarged and merged together. When humidity was high, black acervuli with grey brown cirrhus of conidia were rapidly produced in lesions. Infected plants eventually withered or collapsed from the stem rot (Suppl. Fig2). Infected tissues were surface-sterilized in 1% NaOCl for 1 min, washed three times with distilled water, and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Colonies on PDA, growing at 25\u00b0C in darkness, showed grayish brown and grey brown conidial masses produced from acervuli with black seta (Suppl. Fig3). Acervuli (n=30) were dark brown to black and approximately round, 121 to 210 \u03bcm in diameter, averaging 166.5 \u03bcm (Suppl. Fig4). Setae (n=30) scattered in acervuli, black, septate, 94.4 to 128.4\u00d73.4 to 4.7 \u03bcm, base inflated, and narrower toward the top (Suppl. Fig5). Conidiophores (n=50) were phialidic, hyaline, unicellular. Conidia (n=50) were hyaline, monospora, falcate, base obtuse, apices acute, and 20.5 to 24.7 \u00d72.8 to 3.4 \u03bcm (Suppl. Fig6). Six monoconidial isolates were made, and the morphological characteristics of the fungus were similar to those of\u00a0Colletotrichum capsici\u00a0(Syd.) Butler & Bisby (Mordue, 1971). In the greenhouse (25 to 30 \u00b0C, relative humidity 98%), pathogenicity tests were conducted by spraying a 106 spores /mL suspension on leaves and stems of 10 healthy potted A. macrorrhizos plants (3-year-old). A control was included that consisted of ten plants sprayed with sterile distilled water. All treated plants were covered with a plastic bag and removed 48 h later. After 12 days, all inoculated leaves and stems appeared with typical Anthracnose symptoms, whereas control plants remained healthy. The fungus was reisolated from diseased tissues, fulfilling Koch\u00b4s postulates. The ITS region of a representative isolate was amplified and sequenced using the primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990).The obtained ITS sequence (GenBank Accession No. KJ018793.1) showed 100% similarity to\u00a0Colletotrichum capsici (Accession No. HQ271469.1 and DQ454016.1). Colletotrichum capsici is\u00a0synonymous\u00a0to\u00a0Colletotrichum truncatum. Colletotrichum capsici\u00a0is\u00a0a major phytopathogen with a broad host range which causes anthracnose disease. The first report of\u00a0C. capsici\u00a0as a pathogen of Alocasia\u00a0macrorrhizos was reported in India in 1979 (Mathur, 1979). To our knowledge, this is the first record of\u00a0C. capsici\u00a0causing anthracnose on\u00a0A. macrorrhizos\u00a0in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Tianjin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Tianjin, China; benhaiyan506@163.com."}], "LastName": "Ben", "ForeName": "HaiYan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Tianjin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Tianjin, China; huojianfei@163.com."}], "LastName": "Huo", "ForeName": "JianFei", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Tianjin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Tianjin, China; yaoyurong@163.com."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "YuRong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Tianjin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Tianjin, China; gaowei5277@163.com."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Tianjin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Tianjin, China; wangwanli@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "WanLi", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Tianjin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Tianjin, China; haoyongjuan@163.com."}], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "YongJuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China; huichongxueyan1@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "XueYan", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "33"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["32990523", "10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1228-PDN"]}}]}
