This study aimed to provide comprehensive information on nutritional benefits, ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemical constituents, pharmacological properties and toxicology study of S. mombin. Information was gathered from documented literatures in scientific database.", "The study revealed that S. mombin has nutritional values; with the leaf, fruit, flower, seed, and stem bark possessing a wide range of ethnomedicinal uses across several regions, with documented pharmacological properties. S. mombin has a frequent rate of ethnomedicinal utility in cases of abortion, constipation, fever, gonorrhea, postpartum hemorrhage, digestive pain, diarrhoea, dysentery and wounds. Ethnopharmacological studies showed that crude extracts and chemical compounds from S. mombin manifested in vivo and in vitro biological and pharmacological activities. About 102 isolated compounds from the leaf, fruit, or stem bark of S. mombin have been reported.", "Overall, S. mombin has several nutritive and ethnomedicinal benefits owing to its chemical constituents, which are linkable to the several pharmacological activities.
