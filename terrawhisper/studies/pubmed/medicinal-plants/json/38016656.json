It contains a wide range of bioactive constituents found in both fixed and essential oils. It has been used for hundreds of years as an alternative ethnomedicine to treat a wide range of skin conditions. <i>N. sativa's</i> dermatological applications in skin diseases are attributed to its potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory properties, making it an intriguing skincare candidate. Several studies unravelled positive results associated with <i>N. sativa</i> on skin diseases. As <i>N. sativa</i> is the most studied medicinal plant, several preclinical and clinical studies have been conducted to establish its use in the treatment of various skin diseases. Thymoquinone has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties, which mainly contributed to the treatment of skin diseases. In this context, the present review explores all the available studies on the association of <i>N. sativa</i> and its effect on treating skin diseases in light of recent studies and patents supporting its therapeutic applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Thieme.
