It is increasingly consumed for its high nutritional profile and history of ethnomedical uses including treatment of arthritis. Little pharmacological evidences support this folk use except for previous in vitro study that reported significant inhibition of protein denaturation.", "The study aims at providing new in vivo evidence on antiarthritic activity of P. peruviana fruits in vivo that justifies its traditional use through mechanism-based experiment.", "Inhibition of inflammatory mediators is considered one of the key treatments to alleviate painful symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Anti-inflammatory activity was assessed against COX-1 and COX-2 activity in vitro. Serum TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were traced using in vivo model of adjuvant-induced arthritis. Gross/inflammatory changes in rat paw, relative mass indices of spleen and liver were further investigated together with joint tissue histoarchitecture. Seven metabolites from different phytochemical classes, that were previously reported in P. peruviana fruit, were evaluated in silico against TNF-\u03b1 target protein (PDB ID: 2AZ5) to assess their inhibitory effect. This was followed by assessment of their drug-likeness based on Lipinski's rule according to their physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties.", "High dose of extract (E-1000 mg) improved adjuvant-induced cachexia and attenuated immune-inflammatory responses in paw and serum parameters, with equipotent effect to MTX, in addition to minimal side effect profile on spleen and liver. Histopathological study of knee joint tissues confirmed dose-dependent improvement in arthritic groups treated with P. peruviana fruit extracts. The insilico study recommended steroidal lactones withaperuvin E/C and hydroxywithanolide E as promising lead compounds for inhibiting TNF enzyme as evidenced by docking scores of 6.301, 5.488 and 5.763\u00a0kcal/mol, respectively, fitting as well the Lipinski's rule of drug likeness.", "The study provided novel approach that rationalize folk use of P. peruviana fruit in treatment of arthritis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
