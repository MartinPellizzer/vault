Under voltage clamp, the initial rate of increase in [Ca2+](i) in guard cells is sensitive to the extracellular divalent concentration, suggesting a close interaction between the permeant ion and channel gating. To test this idea, we recorded single-channel currents across the Vicia guard cell plasma membrane using Ba2+ as a charge carrying ion. Unlike other Ca2+ channels characterised to date, these channels activate at hyperpolarising voltages. We found that the open probability (P(o)) increased strongly with external Ba2+ concentration, consistent with a 4-fold cooperative action of Ba2+ in which its binding promoted channel opening in the steady state. Dwell time analyses indicated the presence of a single open state and at least three closed states of the channel, and showed that both hyperpolarising voltage and external Ba2+ concentration prolonged channel residence in the open state. Remarkably, increasing Ba2+ concentration also enhanced the sensitivity of the open channel to membrane voltage. We propose that Ba2+ binds at external sites distinct from the permeation pathway and that divalent binding directly influences the voltage gate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biophysics, Imperial College at Wye, Kent TN25 5AH, Wye, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hamilton", "ForeName": "D W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hills", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blatt", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "FEBS Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "0155157", "ISSNLinking": "0014-5793"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "24GP945V5T", "NameOfSubstance": "Barium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Barium"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Channels"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ion Channel Gating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patch-Clamp Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Protoplasts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11226428", "10.1016/s0014-5793(01)02176-7", "S0014-5793(01)02176-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
