The possibility that ACC was recognized by the enzyme as a D-amino acid was investigated by examining the efficiencies of the four stereoisomers of 1-amino-2-ethylcyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (AEC) serving as substrates of malonyltransferase and as inhibitors of ACC malonyltransferase. Although all four isomers were malonylated by the enzyme and competitively inhibited the malonylation of ACC to N-malonyl-ACC, (1R,2S)-AEC and (1R,2R)-AEC, both of which have an R-configuration as a D-amino acid, had lower Km and Ki values (0.1 to 0.2 mM) than their enantiomers, (1S,2R)-AEC (Km and Ki values were about 1 mM) and (1S,2S)-AEC (Km and Ki values were higher than 10 mM), which have an S-configuration as an L-amino acid. Similarly, (R)-isovaline (2-amino-2-methylbutanoic acid), which has an R-configuration as a D-amino acid, inhibited more effectively the enzymatic conversion of ACC to malonyl-ACC than did (S)-isovaline, which has an S-configuration as an L-amino acid. In mungbean hypocotyls (1R,2S)-AEC and (1R,2R)-AEC were also more efficiently converted into malonyl conjugates and more efficiently inhibited the conversion of radioactive ACC into malonyl-ACC than their enantiomers, although the differences in efficiency among stereoisomers were smaller in hypocotyls than in enzymatic reactions. These results suggest that ACC is recognized by the enzyme as a D-amino acid."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "L Y", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "S F", "Initials": "SF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids, Cyclic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9EJ633GL", "NameOfSubstance": "1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "595-40-4", "NameOfSubstance": "isovaline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "80483-77-8", "NameOfSubstance": "1-amino-2-ethylcyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "D-amino acid malonyltransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "HG18B9YRS7", "NameOfSubstance": "Valine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids, Cyclic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Valine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6517594", "10.1016/0003-9861(84)90204-2", "0003-9861(84)90204-2"]}}]}
