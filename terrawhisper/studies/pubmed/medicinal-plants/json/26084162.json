As commonly used plant growth retardant, paclobutrazol, uniconazole, chlorocholine chloride, mepiquat chloride, choline chloride and daminozide are used to promote the growth of root and rhizome, call as \"zhuanggenling\", \"pengdasu\", \"pengdaji\" etc. Single or recombination of plant growth regulator is registered as pesticide, and called as pesticide \"zhuanggenling\" in this paper. Growth regulator which registered as a foliar fertilizer or fertilization was called agricultural fertilizer \"zhuanggenling\" in this paper. The author investigate the usage of \"zhuanggenling\" in the root and rhizome of medicinal plants cultivation from 2012 to 2014 in Sichuan province, Huangyuan town, Mianyang (Ophiopogonis Radix); Pengzhou Aoping town (Chuanxiong Rhizoma); Pengshan Xiejia town (Alismatis Rhizoma); Jiangyou Taiping town and Zhangming town (Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata); Yunnan Wenshan (Notoginseng Radix et Rhizoma); Henan province, Wuzhidafeng Town (Rehmanniae Radix, Achyranthis Bidentatae Radix, Dioscoreae Rhizoma); Gansu Min county (Codonopsis Radix, Angelicae Sinensis Radix); Gansu Li county (Rhei Radix et Rhizoma). The result showed that \"zhuanggenling\" were applied in the most medicinal plant cultivation except Rhei Radix et Rhizoma. It has been applied widespreadly in Ophiopogonis Radix, Alismatis Rhizoma, Achyranthis Bidentatae Radix, Codonopsis Radix; Rehmanniae Radix, commonly in Angelicae Sinensis Radix application, and occasionally in Chuanxiong Rhizoma, Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata, Notoginseng Radix et Rhizoma and Dioscoreae Rhizoma. In 53 collected sample from plantation areas, fifteen (28%) were pesticide \"zhuanggenling\", thirty-eight (72%) were pesticide \"zhuanggenling\". UPLC analysis results showed that 38 farmers fertilizer \"zhuanggenling\" content of 6 kinds of plant growth retardant. It is regarded that fertilizer \"zhuanggenling\" was dominant in medicinal plant cultivation, and that the plant growth retardant is added widespreadly in farm fertilizer \"zhuanggenling\". All evidence proves conclusively that \"zhuanggenling\" have been used in the proper way, whereas some others have been misused or even abused in the use regarding to type, number, use frequency. The root or rhizoma are increased to 20%-200%. But there is lack of evaluation to appraise the quality of medicinal materials from the aspects of research or industry. \"zhuanggenling\" has become a important Chemical control material besides fertilizer, insecticidal sterilization of pesticide"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhai", "ForeName": "Yu-yao", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Bao-lin", "Initials": "BL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Wen-hua", "Initials": "WH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26084162"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
