In most cases phytate-phosphorus was also evaluated. In different food samples iron to phosphorus ratio in phytate generally deviated significantly from the theoretical 1.20 value. Wheat flour products, maize, rice, beans, peas, lentil and soy from Vietnam and Hungary, furthermore several bakery products from Hungary and some imported soy products were analysed for phytate content. The effect of heat and fermentation on phytate content was also checked in breads and other foods. It was concluded that the processes often used in food industry, namely fermentation and thermal load, have relatively slight effect on the phytate content of plant foods. Cooking losses for phytates ranged 1-60% in cereals and legumes according to the usual kitchen technique in Vietnam."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vinh", "ForeName": "L T", "Initials": "LT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dworsch\u00e1k", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Nahrung", "NlmUniqueID": "0142530", "ISSNLinking": "0027-769X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "7IGF0S7R8I", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Bread"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hungary"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vietnam"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3990783", "10.1002/food.19850290211"]}}]}
