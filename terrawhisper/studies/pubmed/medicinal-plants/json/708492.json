The blood was collected in a siliconized centrifuge tube containing sodium citrate. The aggregating agents used were ADP, epinephrine and collagen. In each subject aggregation was studied 3 times: (i) initial fasting control; (ii) immediately after (i) but with essential oil of garlic drawn into the syringe together with the sodium citrate; (iii) 5 days after feeding 0.5 mg of essential oil of garlic daily. Addition of essential oil of garlic inhibited in-vitro platelet aggregation induced by ADP, epinephrine or collagen; the effect was dose-related. Oral administration of garlic also decreased platelet aggregation. Thus, garlic seems to inhibit some aspects of thrombus formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bordia", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Atherosclerosis", "NlmUniqueID": "0242543", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9150"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "61D2G4IYVH", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Diphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YKH834O4BH", "NameOfSubstance": "Epinephrine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Diphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Epinephrine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["708492", "10.1016/0021-9150(78)90129-6", "0021-9150(78)90129-6"]}}]}
