Therefore, the number of analytical methods for the analysis of these compounds has been increasing. In this review, the extraction methods as well as the chromatographic separation and detection techniques based on mass spectrometry to determine tropane alkaloids and calystegines in plant raw material and food have been described. Finally, a summary of the natural occurrence of tropane alkaloids and calystegines in the studied matrices, as well as their accidental presence in food, is presented, highlighting current and future determination trends."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
