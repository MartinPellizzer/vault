The resolution and speed of separation were greatly improved in comparison with previous fractionations. Twelve discrete fractions were obtained and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Six \"normal\" legumin subunits (Mr 60,000) were identified as well as some \"large\" (Mr 66,000) and \"small\" (Mr 44,000) subunits. A few polypeptides of unknown origin were also observed. Four subunits were purified to homogeneity as adjudged by electrophoresis and HPLC and in sufficient yields to permit further studies. Anomalous electrophoretic behavior of the legumin subunits was also observed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bacon", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lambert", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Phalp", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Plumb", "ForeName": "G W", "Initials": "GW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wright", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370535", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Macromolecular Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macromolecular Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Legumins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3565752", "10.1016/0003-2697(87)90631-2", "0003-2697(87)90631-2"]}}]}
