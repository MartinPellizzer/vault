The IC50 values of piperbetol, methylpiperbetol, piperol A, piperol B, and ginkgolide B were about 18.2, 10.6, 114.2, 11.8, and 4.8 mumol/l, respectively. The inhibitory potency of ginkgolide B was about 2.8, 1.2, 22.8, and 1.4 times higher than those of piperbetol, methylpiperbetol, piperol A, and piperol B. The concentration-response curve of PAF-induced platelet aggregation was shifted to the right by 50 mumol/l of piperbetol, methylpiperbetol, piperol A, piperol B, and ginkgolide B. The EC50 of PAF was increased by these compounds from 1.5 nmol/l to 14.3, 23.1, 2.4, 20.6, and 47.2 nmol/l, respectively. The compounds also inhibited the binding of [3H]-PAF to washed rabbit platelets with IC50 values of 8.7, 5.3, 88, 6.2, and 1.8 mumol/l. Correlating with the inhibitory potency for platelet aggregation, the inhibitory potency of ginkgolide B for binding of PAF was about 3.8, 1.9, 48, and 2.4 times higher than those of piperbetol, methylpiperbetol, piperol A, and piperol B. However, the aggregation of washed rabbit platelets induced by threshold ADP and arachidonic acid were unaffected by piperbetol, methylpiperbetol, piperol A, and piperol B. Furthermore, piperbetol, methylpiperbetol, piperol A, and piperol B had no effects on the cAMP contents in rest washed rabbit platelets. In conclusion, these data indicate that piperbetol, methylpiperbetol, piperol A, and piperol B are effective PAF receptor antagonists in vitro."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacy Center of Navy, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "H W", "Initials": "HW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Y Y", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "D G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bian", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Z L", "Initials": "ZL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Cell Surface"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "platelet activating factor receptor"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lignans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Cell Surface"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9270371", "10.1055/s-2006-957685"]}}]}
