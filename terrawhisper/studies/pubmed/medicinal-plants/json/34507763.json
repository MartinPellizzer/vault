The current study was designed to investigate and compare the metabolite diversity, including the nutritional potential of rhizomatous and aerial parts (leaves and fruits) of Polygonatum verticillatum. Comprehensive metabolites through UPLC-PDA-ESI/MS were tentatively identified 38, 31, and 16 compounds while 342, 414, and 314 were identified through METLIN database in leaves, fruits, and rhizomes, respectively. Total phenolic, flavonoid, protein, carbohydrate, and fat content were compared and found in the range of 24.50-27.64 and 101.40-109.50, 99-100, 58-200, 5-56\u00a0\u00b5g/mg, respectively, while antioxidant activity was highest in fruits (IC<sub>50DPPH</sub> 456.30\u00a0\u00b5g/ml). Polyphenols, essential amino acids, and macro & micronutrients were estimated in all the parts of P. verticillatum. Leaves contained the highest number of targeted polyphenols and amino acids, followed by fruits and rhizomes. Statistical analysis (Venn-diagram, Heatmap, stacked charts, PCA, PCoA) has visualized that all parts have similar nutritional potential and chemical diversity. The current finding unleashed the possibilities of utilizing aerial parts instead of rhizomes that would save this plant from overexploitation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
