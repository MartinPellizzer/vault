But the features and mechanical strength of DNA assembly made from differently shaped large-sized DAE DNA tiles and the effects of various geometries on the final DNA assembly are yet to be explored. Herein, we focused on examining DNA lattices synthesized from DX bi-triangular, DNA tiles (T) with concave and convex regions along the perimeter of the tiles. The bi-triangular DNA tiles \"T(A) and T(B)\" were synthesized by self-assembling the freshly prepared short circular scaffold (S) strands \"S(A) and S(B)\", each of 106 nucleotides (NT) lengths. The tiles \"T(A) and T(B)\" were then coupled together to get assembled via sticky ends. It resulted in the polymerization of DNA tiles into large-sized DNA lattices with giant micrometer-scale dimensions to form the \"T(A)\u00a0+\u00a0T(B)\" assembly. These DNA macro-frameworks were visualized \"in the air\" under atomic force microscopy (AFM) employing tapping mode. We have characterized how curvature in DNA tiles may undergo transitions and transformations to adjust the overall torque, strain, twists, and the topology of the final self-assembly array of DNA tiles. According to our results, our large-span DX tiles assembly \"T(A)\u00a0+\u00a0T(B)\" despite the complicated curvatures and mechanics, was successfully packed into giant DNA lattices of the width of 30-500\u00a0nm and lengths of 500\u00a0nm to over 10\u00a0\u03bcm. Conclusively, the micrometer-scale \"T(A)\u00a0+\u00a0T(B)\" framework assembly was rigid, stable, stiff, and exhibited enough tensile strength to form monocrystalline lattices."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
