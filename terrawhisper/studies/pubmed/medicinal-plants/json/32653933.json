Among various alternative sources, natural compounds such as plant essential oils, plant extracts and recombinant antimicrobial peptides are of significance. The aim of the present study was to investigate antimicrobial activity of plants essential oils and plant extracts of six medicinal plants (Lippia citriodora, Ferula gummosa, Bunium persicum, Mentha piperita, Plantago major and Salvadora persica) along with a chimera peptide of camel lactoferrin, which is the most important antimicrobial component of camel milk, against Pseudomonas tolaasii and Trichoderma harzianum as pathogens of white button mushroom. The antibacterial activity test was conducted under in vitro conditions through disc diffusion method. The results showed that chimera camel lactoferrin peptide, with the highest amount of inhibitory zone (14.63\u00a0mm in 20\u00a0\u03bcg/mL concentration), has a significant difference in antibacterial activity compared to other treatments. Ferula gummosa conferred no antibacterial activity. Also, the results of antifungal effects indicated that plant essential oils and extracts have more antifungal activity than recombinant peptide. Generally, L. citriodora, B. persicum, M. piperita treatments could completely prevent growth of fungal in in vitro conditions. Therefore, using the mentioned plants can be a good replacement for reducing the chemical pesticides against pathogenic agents of button mushroom, without any adverse effects on environment and human health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology and Plant Breeding, Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tanhaeian", "ForeName": "Abbas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nazifi", "ForeName": "Narges", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2508-7590"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology and Plant Breeding, Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran. shahriari@um.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Shahriari Ahmadi", "ForeName": "Farajollah", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Protection, Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Akhlaghi", "ForeName": "Mahdi", "Initials": "M"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2/40709", "Agency": "Ferdowsi University of Mashhad", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Arch Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0410427", "ISSNLinking": "0302-8933"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactoferrin"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Pseudomonas tolaasii"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agaricus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactoferrin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trichoderma"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32653933", "10.1007/s00203-020-01964-2", "10.1007/s00203-020-01964-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
