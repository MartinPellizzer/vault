Extraction by shaking with water at room temperature was more convenient to use than a previously published Soxhlet procedure for analysis of packaged Ginkgo biloba seeds (white nuts) for ginkgotoxin; recoveries from spiked dried seeds by the simple extraction procedure averaged 76%. Determination was by liquid chromatography with UV or fluorescence detection. Recoveries of ginkgotoxin from a spiked and unspiked natural health product (powder from Ginkgo biloba capsules) were equivalent by both procedures; recovery from spiked powder by the simple extraction procedure was 81%. Application of this extraction procedure in the analysis of 6 samples of white nuts (vacuum packaged and canned products) showed that free ginkgotoxin was present in 5 samples at concentrations up to 25 microg/g dry weight. Total ginkgotoxin was determined after hydrolysis with beta-glucosidase of sample extracts in which a peak corresponding to the 5'-O-glucoside was detected. Ginkgotoxin was determined in 10 Ginkgo biloba natural health products by the same method at levels up to 181 microg/g."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Canada, Health Products and Food Branch, Food Research Division, Address Locator 2203D, Ottawa, Ontario, K1A 0L2, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lawrence", "ForeName": "Guillaume A", "Initials": "GA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scott", "ForeName": "Peter M", "Initials": "PM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J AOAC Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9215446", "ISSNLinking": "1060-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "4'-O-methylpyridoxine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.21", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-Glucosidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KV2JZ1BI6Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridoxine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry Techniques, Analytical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Pyridoxine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "beta-Glucosidase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15759722"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
