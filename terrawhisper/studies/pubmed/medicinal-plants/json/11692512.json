Immunomodulators are substances that exert this control and include cytokines, pharmaceuticals, microbial products, nutraceuticals, and traditional medicinal plants. Although treatment and prevention of infectious diseases are the most common reasons to use immunomodulators, other conditions, such as amelioration of stress-induced immunosuppression, maturation of the neonate's developing immune response, and strategies to reduce the metabolic cost of eliciting an immune response also are well suited for immunomodulation. Continued discovery of new immune regulators and increased understanding of immunity in food-producing animals will ensure new opportunities for the use of immunomodulators in food-producing animals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, USA. blecha@vet.ksu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blecha", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Vet Clin North Am Food Anim Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "8511905", "ISSNLinking": "0749-0720"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Domestic"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Communicable Disease Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "immunology", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Communicable Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immune Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}], "NumberOfReferences": "89"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11692512", "10.1016/s0749-0720(15)30010-4", "S0749-0720(15)30010-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
