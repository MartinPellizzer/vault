A series of eugenol esters (ST1-ST7) and chloro eugenol (<i>ST8</i>) have been synthesized. The structures of newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR and mass spectrometry. In an effort to evaluate the pharmacological activity of eugenol derivatives, we explored its anti-inflammatory potential against skin inflammation using <i>in-vitro</i> and <i>in-vivo</i> bioassay. Synthesized derivatives significantly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines against LPS-induced inflammation in macrophages. Among all derivatives, <i>ST8</i> [Chloroeugenol (6-chloro, 2-methoxy-4-(prop-2-en-1-yl)-phenol)] exhibited most potent anti-inflammatory activity without any cytotoxic effect. We have further evaluated the efficacy and safety in in-vivo condition. <i>ST8</i> exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity against TPA-induced skin inflammation without any skin irritation effect on experimental animals. These findings suggested that <i>ST8</i> may be a useful therapeutic candidate for the treatment of skin inflammation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Bioprospection Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sai Nath University, Ranchi, India."}], "LastName": "Maurya", "ForeName": "Anil Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Process Chemistry and Technology, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, New Delhi 110025, India."}], "LastName": "Agarwal", "ForeName": "Karishma", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Bioprospection Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Amit Chand", "Initials": "AC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Bioprospection Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Saxena", "ForeName": "Archana", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Process Chemistry and Technology, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Nooreen", "ForeName": "Zulfa", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Process Chemistry and Technology, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, New Delhi 110025, India."}], "LastName": "Tandon", "ForeName": "Sudeep", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Process Chemistry and Technology, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, New Delhi 110025, India."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Ateeque", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Bioprospection Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, New Delhi 110025, India."}], "LastName": "Bawankule", "ForeName": "Dnyaneshwar Umrao", "Initials": "DU"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3T8H1794QW", "NameOfSubstance": "Eugenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Eugenol"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30580605", "10.1080/14786419.2018.1528585"]}}]}
