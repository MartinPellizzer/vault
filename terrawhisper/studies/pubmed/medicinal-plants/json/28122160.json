Among different parts of the P.\u00a0trimera plant, leaf is considered as a residual part after harvesting of the root. This study aimed to determine the physiochemical properties and the antioxidant and anti-proliferative capacities of P.\u00a0trimera leaf (PTL) using microwave drying for the preparation of dry sample; MeOH and microwave-assisted extraction for the preparation of crude extract; and freeze-drying for the preparation of powdered extract. The results showed that total phenolic, total flavonoid, proanthocyanidin, and saponin contents of PTL prepared by microwave drying at 450\u00a0W were 25.4\u00a0mg gallic acid equiv. (GAE), 86.3\u00a0mg rutin equiv. (RE), 5.6\u00a0mg catechin equiv. (CE), and 702.1\u00a0mg escin equiv. (EE) per gram dried sample, respectively. Gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, ellagic acid, rutin, and quercetin were identified in the PTL MeOH extract. Dried PTL displayed potent antioxidant activity, while the powdered PTL extract exhibited great anti-proliferative capacity on various cancer cell lines including MiaPaCa-2 (pancreas), HT29 (colon), A2780 (ovarian), H460 (lung), A431 (skin), Du145 (prostate), BE2-C (neuroblastoma), MCF-7 (breast), MCF-10A (normal breast), and U87, SJ-G2, and SMA (glioblastoma). Anti-proliferative capacity on pancreatic cancer cells (MiaCaPa2, BxPc3, and CFPAC1) of PTL extract (200\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) was significantly higher (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than those of ostruthin (20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and gemcitabine (50\u00a0nm), and to be comparable to the powdered P.\u00a0trimera root extract and a saponin-enriched extract from quillajia bark (a commercial product). The findings from this study allow us to conclude that the PTL is a rich source of phytochemicals that possess promising antioxidant and anti-proliferative activities, therefore it shows potential as lead compounds for application in the nutraceutical, medicinal and pharmaceutical industries."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Life Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Newcastle, Ourimbah, NSW, 2258, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Technology, Faculty of Food Technology, Nha Trang University, No. 2 Nguyen Dinh Chieu, Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa, 8458, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Nguyen", "ForeName": "Van Tang", "Initials": "VT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital, Waratah, NSW, 2298, Australia."}], "LastName": "Sakoff", "ForeName": "Jennette A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Life Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Newcastle, Ourimbah, NSW, 2258, Australia."}], "LastName": "Scarlett", "ForeName": "Christopher J", "Initials": "CJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biodivers", "NlmUniqueID": "101197449", "ISSNLinking": "1612-1872"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proanthocyanidins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "18206-61-6", "NameOfSubstance": "proanthocyanidin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microwaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Proanthocyanidins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rutaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28122160", "10.1002/cbdv.201600498"]}}]}
