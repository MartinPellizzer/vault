However, there is no bibliometric analysis on the publications of EJMC to thoroughly assess the scientific output and current status systematically. Therefore, the study was conducted to analyze the various publications of EJMC from 1987 to 2022 to improve their quality. A total of 13,386 papers were retrieved, with the number of publications increasing yearly. Based on the multiple indicators of bibliometrics, the highest impact countries, institutions, authors and representative literature were identified, and visualization networks were constructed using VOSviewer. Keyword co-occurrence analysis reveals a gradual shift from phenotypic drug discovery to target-based drug discovery in the EJMC theme change. Moreover, further discussion of the keyword clustering results is provided to support researchers in defining the scope of their research topics and planning their research directions. At this stage, there is a greater focus on developing antitumor and oxidative stress-related drugs than on the earlier anti-infective activities. In future studies, the main research directions are tumor multidrug resistance, oxidative stress, and dual inhibitors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.
