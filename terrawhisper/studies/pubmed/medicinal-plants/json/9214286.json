The highest in vitro antimicrobial phototoxicity was observed with polyacetylene phenylheptatriin: the activation effect of solar radiation on it was due to UV-A and developed in gaseous phase or to a lesser extent in dispersed liquid phase. For comparison, 18 currently used antibiotics of various chemical structure were investigated and no phototoxicity under the effect of solar radiation with respect to the tested microbes was detected. In nature the phenomenon of antimicrobial phototoxicity of plant secondary metabolites due to the effect of solar radiation is probably of large scale. The study of the phenomenon is a new trend in biology (plant antibiotics and phytoncides, phytoimmunity, ecological and evolutionary microbiology, etc.) and a new approach to increase the efficacy of some antibiotics and to develop principally novel photochemotherapeutics for the treatment of infections in humans, animals and plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Smirnov", "ForeName": "V V", "Initials": "VV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bondarenko", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Evseenko", "ForeName": "O V", "Initials": "OV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Vozde\u012dstvie ul'trafioleta solnechnogo izlucheniia na sistemu mikroorganizmy--antibiotiki vysshikh rasteni\u012d--prirodnoe iavlenie i novy\u012d podkhod k povysheniiu \u00e9ffektivnosti antibiotikov."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Antibiot Khimioter", "NlmUniqueID": "8803688", "ISSNLinking": "0235-2990"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ukraine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9214286"]}}]}
