However, in eastern society, yin-yang is regarded as an incomprehensible ideology without definite physical meaning. Consequently, the yin-yang balance in medicine has not been studied by modern scientific means. In the western world, yin-yang balance is often misunderstood as a religious belief or a principle of lifestyle. Herein, we attempted to define the physical meaning of yin-yang in TCM by correlating it with biochemical processes. We propose that yin-yang balance is antioxidation-oxidation balance with yin representing antioxidation and yang as oxidation. Our proposal is partially supported by the fact that the yin-tonic traditional Chinese herbs have, on average, about six times more antioxidant activity and polyphenolic contents than the yang-tonic herbs. Our hypothesis opens an avenue to systematically study the yin-yang balance and its health implications with the use of modern biochemical tools."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Brunswick Laboratories, Wareham, Massachusetts 02571, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ou", "ForeName": "Boxin", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Dejian", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hampsch-Woodill", "ForeName": "Maureen", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flanagan", "ForeName": "Judith A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "FASEB J", "NlmUniqueID": "8804484", "ISSNLinking": "0892-6638"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12554690", "10.1096/fj.02-0527hyp", "17/2/127"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
