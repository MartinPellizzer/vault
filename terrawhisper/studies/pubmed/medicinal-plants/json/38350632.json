Thirty-six mice were divided into six groups, receiving intraperitoneal injections of saline, ATO, PTX, or a combination for four weeks. Blood samples were analyzed for serum biochemistry, while hepatic tissue underwent examination for histopathological changes and assessment of oxidative stress markers and antioxidant gene expression through Real-Time PCR. ATO exposure significantly increased serum markers (creatinine, ALT, BUN, ALP, AST) and induced histopathological changes in the liver. Moreover, it elevated renal and hepatic nitric oxide (NO) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, and reduced antioxidant enzyme expression (CAT, GSR, GPx, MPO, SOD), total thiol groups (TTGs), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Conversely, PTX treatment effectively lowered serum hepatic and renal markers, improved antioxidant markers, and induced histopathological alterations. Notably, PTX did not significantly affect renal and hepatic NO levels. These findings suggest that PTX offers therapeutic potential in mitigating liver and acute kidney injuries induced by various insults, including exposure to ATO."], "CopyrightInformation": "Thieme.
