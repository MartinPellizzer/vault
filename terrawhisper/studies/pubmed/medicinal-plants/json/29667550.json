Drugresistant microbes are one of the major health problems in the world. To overcome the effect of infectious diseases new antimicrobial agent from nature has been explored which is environmentally friendly, less costly and more effective for the development of next-generation drugs. Bergenia ciliata and silver nitrate both have medicinal properties.", "The aim of the current research was to evaluate the cytotoxic, and antibacterial effect of green synthesized nanoparticles using Bergenia ciliata rhizome against clinical bacterial pathogens.", "Extract of Bergenia ciliata was prepared by maceration technique. Silver nanoparticles were synthesized using Bergenia ciliata rhizome extract. Synthesized silver nanoparticles were confirmed by UV-vis spectrophotometer, Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The antibacterial, anti-biofilm, cell proliferation inhibition, DNA protection, brine shrimp lethality effects of synthesized nanoparticles were investigated.", "UV-vis spectrophotometer indicated the prelaminar synthesis of silver nanoparticles at 400 nm. The spherical shape of synthesized nanoparticles with 35 nm size was confirmed using SEM. Greatest zone of inhibition (6.0 \u00b1 0.0 mm to 8.3 \u00b1 0.57 mm) was recorded against all tested pathogens compared with the B. ciliata aqueous extract. Anti-biofilm analysis and MTT assay supported the results of the antibacterial activity. Silver nanoparticles protect the DNA degradation.", "Green synthesized nanoparticles had potent antibacterial activity and may provide a basis for the development of the new antibacterial drug."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbial Biotechnology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Muzaffarabad, 13100, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Zia", "ForeName": "Ghazna", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbial Biotechnology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Muzaffarabad, 13100, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sadia", "ForeName": "Haleema", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbial Biotechnology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Muzaffarabad, 13100, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Nazir", "ForeName": "Shabnam", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbial Biotechnology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Muzaffarabad, 13100, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ejaz", "ForeName": "Kiren", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbial Biotechnology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Muzaffarabad, 13100, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Shaukat", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ihsan-Ul-Haq"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Muzaffarabad, 13100, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Iqbal", "ForeName": "Tariq", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Muzaffarabad, 13100, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Muhammad A R", "Initials": "MAR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute for Lasers and Optronics (NILOP), Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Raza", "ForeName": "Abida", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbial Biotechnology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Muzaffarabad, 13100, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Andleeb", "ForeName": "Saiqa", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Letter"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Artemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Fragmentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Green Chemistry Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29667550", "10.2174/1389201019666180417160049", "CPB-EPUB-89790"]}}]}
