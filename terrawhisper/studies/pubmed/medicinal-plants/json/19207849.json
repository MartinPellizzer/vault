The Cerrado is the second greater biome of Brazil and it was identified as one of the most distinguished biomes of South America, becoming an important source of innovative vegetal molecules to treat several conditions. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the antifungal potential of Cerrado plants, mainly those used to treat infections and wounds. A total of 57 extracts were screened by the agar-well diffusion technique against Candida albicans and Trichophyton rubrum. The most promising extracts were tested in smaller concentrations and their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by microdilution method. Results were analysed statistically by anova tests. Extracts of Kielmeyera coriacea, Renealmia alpinia, Stryphnodendron adstringens and Tabebuia caraiba were very active against T. rubrum, presented geometric means of the MIC values between 170.39 and 23.23 microg ml(-1). Extracts of Cerrado plants are of particular interest as source of new agents for the treatment of dermatophytic infections."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laborat\u00f3rio de Farmacognosia, Universidade de Bras\u00edlia, Bras\u00edlia, DF, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Melo e Silva", "ForeName": "Fernanda", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Paula", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 Elias", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Espindola", "ForeName": "Laila Salmen", "Initials": "LS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Mycoses", "NlmUniqueID": "8805008", "ISSNLinking": "0933-7407"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Candida albicans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Clusiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tabebuia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trichophyton"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zingiberaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19207849", "10.1111/j.1439-0507.2008.01647.x", "MYC1647"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
