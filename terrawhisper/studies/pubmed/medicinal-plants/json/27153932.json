The diversity of natural products makes them an attractive target for interrogation by both chemists and biologists alike. Indeed, the study of 12-membered macrolactones has already led to the discovery of lead drug compounds and new biological targets, which has motivated the development of diverted total synthetic routes to libraries of analogs. This review explores the discovery, biological characterization, and synthesis of several 12-membered macrolactones, exploiting examples that underscore their importance in the drug discovery field. It is our hope that this review will motivate further interest in this class of natural products, a group of molecules that we think merit the classification of 'privileged scaffolds' within the medicinal chemistry community, to further investigate and develop novel compounds with promising bioactivity."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}], "LastName": "Brzozowski", "ForeName": "Richard S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}], "LastName": "Wuest", "ForeName": "William M", "Initials": "WM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 DE025837", "Acronym": "DE", "Agency": "NIDCR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biol Drug Des", "NlmUniqueID": "101262549", "ISSNLinking": "1747-0277"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Macrolides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16QGD97DXG", "NameOfSubstance": "methymycin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Lactones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Macrolides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27153932", "10.1111/cbdd.12783"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
