In this context, plants of the Myrtaceae family popularly used in Brazil for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, including Eugenia sonderiana, have shown beneficial effects due to the presence of phenolic compounds and saponins in their chemical constitution. Thus, the present work aimed to perform the phytochemical characterization of the hydroethanolic extract of E. sonderiana leaves using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), along with in vitro and in vivo studies of antidiabetic activity. The chemical characterization revealed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, neolignans, tannins, and saponins. In addition, the extract exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations of alpha-amylase and alpha-glycosidase higher than the acarbose in the in vitro tests. Also, the in vivo tests revealed a slight increase in body mass in diabetic rats, as well as a significant decrease in water and feed consumption provided by the extract. Regarding serum biochemical parameters, the extract showed significant activity in decreasing the levels of glucose, hepatic enzymes, and triglycerides, in addition to maintaining HDL cholesterol levels within normal ranges, protecting the cell membranes against oxidative damage. Thus, the extract of E. sonderiana leaves was considered promising pharmaceutical ingredient in the production of a phytotherapy medication."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
