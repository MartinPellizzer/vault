The current review addressed the differential qualitative/quantitative phytochemical make-ups for the first time for better utilization as nutraceuticals and to identify potential uses based on the chemical makeup of both cultivars (cvs.). In addition, extraction methods are compared highlighting their advantages and/or limitations with regards to improving yield and stability of cabbage bioactives, especially glucosinolates. Besides, the review recapitulated detailed action mechanism and safety of cabbage bioactives, as well as processing technologies to further improve their effects are posed as future perspectives. White and red cabbage cvs. revealed different GLSs profile which affected by food processing, including enzymatic hydrolysis, thermal breakdown, and leaching. In addition, the red cultivar provides high quality pigment for industrial applications. Moreover, non-conventional modern extraction techniques showed promising techniques for the recovery of their bioactive constituents compared to solvent extraction. All these findings pose white and red cabbages as potential candidates for inclusion in nutraceuticals and/or to be commercialized as functional foods prepared in different culinary forms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5747-6972"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy Department, College of Pharmacy, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Bioprocess Engineering, Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany."}], "LastName": "Zayed", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aromatic and Medicinal Plants Department, Desert Research Center, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Sheashea", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0924-1770"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry of Natural Compounds Department, National Research Centre, Dokki, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Kassem", "ForeName": "Iman A A", "Initials": "IAA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5139-1863"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy Department, College of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Farag", "ForeName": "Mohamed A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosinolates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brassica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosinolates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "41"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35174750", "10.1080/10408398.2022.2040416"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
