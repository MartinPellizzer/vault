The pathological model of the disease in mice was made with administration of AlCl3 and then Yizhiling Granule was given to treat it.", "In the experiment of one trial passive avoidance response there were significant difference between the normal group and the model group (P < 0.01) and significant difference between the treated group and the model group (P < 0.05-0.01); as for fresh brain weight, the treated group was significantly different from the normal group (P < 0.01) and model group (P < 0.05). They indicate that Yizhiling Granule could improve memory and increase brain weight.
