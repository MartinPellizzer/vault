Lamb abomasum sourced biochemical drug Lamb's trip extract and Vitamin B12 capsule used for the clinical treatment of chronic gastritis, gastric ulcer, and reversal of intestinal metaplasia. Therefore, claimed to have prevention of gastric cancer activity.", "In this study, we aim to assess whether the glycoprotein has biological activity in the cure of gastric disorder and conduct a structure-activity relationship.", "Glycoproteins' extraction conditions were optimized by the response surface method and purified with DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-50 chromatography. Two homogenous glycoproteins' physiochemical structures were studied with electrophoresis, HPLC analysis, peroxide oxidation, and \u03b2-elimination, FT-IR, CD, LC-MS/MS, and EDS analysis. The antiinflammation activity of the glycoprotein was determined against COX-2 and LOX-15 enzyme inhibitory ability in vitro, and antitumor activity against HT-29 and HGC-25, and cytotoxicity on L-02\u00a0cells was determined in vivo with the MTT method.", "The abomasum was abundant in glycoprotein and the extraction yield of glycoprotein was up to 24.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1% under optimized conditions. Two homogeneous glycoproteins SAGP-I and SAGP-II determined to be ribose-conjugated and sulfated glycoproteins with a molecular weight of 15.6\u00a0kDa and 6.4\u00a0kDa. And according to the structural analysis, SAGP-I was a mucin-type ribose-conjugated glycoprotein with 14 O-glycosylation and one N- glycosylation site. SAGP-I and SAGP-II have remarkable anti-inflammatory activity against COX-2 enzyme with the IC<sub>50</sub> of 17.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and 16.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.11\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively. Meanwhile, the two glycoproteins showed strong antitumor activity against HT-29 with the EC<sub>50</sub> of 19.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.46\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and 184.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively.", "The Highly purified glycoprotein SAGP-1 and SAGP-II showed anti-inflammatory activity against the COX-2 enzyme, and antitumor activity against HT-29 human colon cancer cells and noun-inhibitory activity against LOX-15 enzyme and HGC-25. Both glycoproteins are ribose conjugated and sulfated whose characters are related to their anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activity. Such results suggest the possibility of anti-inflammatory and pre-cancer activity. And in some degree explains the pharmacy of abomasum's traditional use in gastric disorder and clinical use of lamb abomasum APIs drugs' in gastric disorders and gastric cancer development. This study provides a preliminary basis for the further study of the per-cancer mechanism of lamb abomasum glycoprotein.
