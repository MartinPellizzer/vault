Advances in TB immunology have improved our understanding of host signaling pathways, leading to innovative therapeutic strategies. Inflammasomes, protein complexes organized by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), play a crucial role in the immune response to <i>M. tb</i> by activating caspase 1, which matures proinflammatory cytokines IL1\u03b2 and IL18. While inflammation is necessary to fight infection, excessive or dysregulated inflammation can cause tissue damage, highlighting the need for precise inflammasome regulation. Drug-resistant TB strains have spurred research into adjunctive host-directed therapies (HDTs) that target inflammasome pathways to control inflammation. Canonical and non-canonical inflammasome pathways can trigger excessive inflammation, leading to immune system exhaustion and <i>M. tb</i> spread. Novel HDT interventions can leverage precision medicine by tailoring treatments to individual inflammasome responses. Studies show that medicinal plant derivatives like silybin, andrographolide, and micheliolide and small molecules such as OLT1177, INF39, CY-09, JJ002, Ac-YVAD-cmk, TAK-242, and MCC950 can modulate inflammasome activation. Molecular tools like gene silencing and knockouts may also be used for severe TB cases. This review explores these strategies as potential adjunctive HDTs in fighting TB."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Laboratory Medicine and Medical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban 4000, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Cebani", "ForeName": "Lilitha", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3759-7141"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Laboratory Medicine and Medical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban 4000, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Mvubu", "ForeName": "Nontobeko E", "Initials": "NE"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "TMA2020CDF-3167", "Agency": "European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int J Mol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101092791", "ISSNLinking": "1422-0067"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inflammasomes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antitubercular Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammasomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Tuberculosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Host-Pathogen Interactions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39125766", "10.3390/ijms25158196", "ijms25158196"]}}]}
