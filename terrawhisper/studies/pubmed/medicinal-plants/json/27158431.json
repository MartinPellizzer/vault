Medicinal plants used in traditional medicine for the treatment of epilepsy have been scientifically shown to possess promising anticonvulsant activities in animal models for screening for anticonvulsant activity and can be a source of newer anticonvulsants. The aim of this study was to investigate the preliminary phytochemical properties, anticonvulsant and anxiolytic activities of <i>Melanthera scandens</i> aqueous and ethanolic extracts. Phytochemicals from the aqueous and ethanolic extracts were screened by standard methods. Anticonvulsant activity was evaluated against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure model in rats. The effect of the extract at oral dose levels of 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg was evaluated in an experimental rat model, using diazepam (5 mg/kg) as positive control. Anxiolytic activity was performed using elevated plus maze method. Phytochemical screening revealed that <i>M. scandens</i> extracts contain carbohydrates, flavonoids, saponins, glycosides, tannins, terpenoids, phenols and phytosterols. The aqueous extract at a dose of 500 mg/kg significantly increased seizure latency (P=0.0023), while the ethanolic extract did not have a significant effect on seizure latency. Both extracts significantly reduced the seizure severity (P= 0.0155), and provided up to 100% protection against PTZ induced death at 1000 mg/kg. Both extracts had no significant effect on the duration of PTZ induced seizures. Both extracts were found to increase the number of entries and the time spent in the open arms of the maze at a dose of 250 mg/kg, indicating anxiolytic activity, which was not seen at higher doses (500 and 1000 mg/kg). The total numbers of entries into the closed arm were significantly reduced at 500 and 1000 mg/kg oral doses of both extracts, indicating a reduction in locomotor activity of the rats. The results obtained in this study suggest that both the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of <i>M. scandens</i> possess anticonvulsant and anxiolytic activities in a rat model."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Mbarara University of Science and Technology, Uganda."}], "LastName": "Twinomujuni", "ForeName": "Silvano S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Mbarara University of Science and Technology, Uganda."}], "LastName": "Oloro", "ForeName": "Joseph", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Mbarara University of Science and Technology, Uganda."}], "LastName": "Alele", "ForeName": "Paul E", "Initials": "PE"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R24 TW008886", "Acronym": "TW", "Agency": "FIC NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Nigeria", "MedlineTA": "Afr J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "101479138", "ISSNLinking": "1996-0816"}, "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflict of interests</b>.
