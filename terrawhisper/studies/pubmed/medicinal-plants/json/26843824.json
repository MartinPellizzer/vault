Hence, this study examined the phenolic compounds profiles and 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free-radical-scavenging activities in the fruit, leaves, and roots of Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer) as a function of cultivation year.", "Profiling of 23 phenolic compounds in ginseng fruit, leaves, and roots was investigated using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with the external calibration method. Antioxidative activity of ginseng fruit, leaves, and roots were evaluated using the method of DPPH free-radical-scavenging activity.", "The total phenol content in ginseng fruit and leaves was higher than in ginseng roots (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and the phenol content in the ginseng samples was significantly correlated to the DPPH free-radical-scavenging activity (r\u00a0=\u00a00.928****). In particular, p-coumaric acid (r\u00a0=\u00a00.847****) and ferulic acid (r\u00a0=\u00a00.742****) greatly affected the DPPH activity. Among the 23 phenolic compounds studied, phenolic acids were more abundant in ginseng fruit, leaves, and roots than the flavonoids and other compounds (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In particular, chlorogenic acid, gentisic acid, p- and m-coumaric acid, and rutin were the major phenolic compounds in 3-6-yr-old ginseng fruit, leaves, and roots.", "This study provides basic information about the antioxidative activity and phenolic compounds profiles in fruit, leaves, and roots of Korean ginseng with cultivation years.
