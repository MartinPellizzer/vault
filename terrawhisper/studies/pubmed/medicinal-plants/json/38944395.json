Tanshinone IIA is a fat-soluble active ingredient obtained from Salvia miltiorrhiza, which has an inhibitory effect against various cancers. We designed and synthesized a novel L-shaped ortho-quinone analog TE5 with tanshinone IIA as the lead compound and tested its antitumor activity against GBM. The results indicated that TE5 effectively inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GBM cells, and demonstrated low toxicity in vitro. We found that TE5 may bind to androgen receptors and promote their degradation through the proteasome. Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was also observed in TE5 treated GBM cells. Additionally, TE5 arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. In vivo experiments further confirmed the anti-tumor activity, safety, and effect on androgen receptor level of TE5 in animal models of GBM. Our results suggest that TE5 may be a potential therapeutic drug to treat GBM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
