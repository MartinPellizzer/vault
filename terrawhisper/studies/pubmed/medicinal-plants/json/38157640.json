Exocarpium Citri Grandis has the effect of dispelling blood stasis and removing phlegm, which can better meet the treatment needs of this disease. However, there is still a lack of focus and depth in the study of the chemical composition of this medicine, and the correlation between the study of relevant medicinal substances and the efficacy of dispelling stasis and removing phlegm is insufficient. To address this issue, this study was carried out to validate the overall efficacy and identify and determine the chemical composition of Exocarpium Citri Grandis. The regulatory mechanism of the PXR-CYP3A4/FXR-LXR\u03b1 pathway and its active ingredients were screened, and a pharmacokinetic study of active ingredients was performed. The obtained multidimensional data were statistically analysed and comprehensively evaluated. The quality marker of Exocarpium Citri Grandis in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia based on the PXR-CYP3A4/FXR-LXR\u03b1 mechanism to exert the efficacy of dispelling blood stasis and removing phlegm was finally determined. Based on the above experiments, we identified 27 compounds from the ethanol extract of Exocarpium Citri Grandis. Among them, naringenin, meranzin hydrate, apigenin, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, anacardiin, hesperidin and naringin can significantly regulate all or part of the targets in the PXR-CYP3A4/FXR-LXR\u03b1 pathway. It also has suitable content and pharmacokinetic characteristics in vivo. In conclusion, this study established quality markers to characterize the efficacy of Exocarpium Citri Grandis in dispelling blood stasis and removing phlegm, which provides a scientific basis for the targeted evaluation of the hypolipidaemic activity of this medicinal plant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
