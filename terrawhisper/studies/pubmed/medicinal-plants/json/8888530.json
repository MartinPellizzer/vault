Over 430 cattle were recorded in 8 herds over 2.5 years. Fodder bank supplementation may have reduced weight losses in calves and breeding females during the dry-season. Emergency sales of immature animals were lower on fodder banks (6.5% vs 14.3%, P < 0.01). There was no evidence that fodder banks reduced cattle mortalities during the dry season. Fodder banks may have had a deleterious effect by encouraging dry-season conceptions. Resulting dry season calvings led to calving percentages of 36.9% on fodder and 60.3% on no fodder (P < 0.05). Calf mortality was also higher on fodder banks; animals not reaching their second year were 13% on fodder bank vs 3.9% on no fodder (P < 0.01). It was concluded that dry season nutrition interaction with the agro-pastoralist livestock system needs further investigation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Badia Research and Development Programme, Higher Council for Science and Technology, Amman, Jordan, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Campbell", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ikuegbu", "ForeName": "O A", "Initials": "OA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Owen", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Little", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Trop Anim Health Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "1277355", "ISSNLinking": "0049-4747"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Animal Husbandry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Birth Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food, Fortified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tropical Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weight Loss"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Trop Anim Health Prod. 1996 May;28(2):183-90", "ArticleIdList": ["8809983"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8888530", "10.1007/BF02240942"]}}]}
