TJ-48, given orally once daily for 5 consecutive days in a dose of 2 g/kg after intravenous infection of C. albicans, prolonged survival period of infected mice of a C3H/He J strain which is characteristic of functional deficiency of macrophages, but did not that of infected mice of a C3H/He N strain with normal macrophage function. Peritoneal macrophages obtained from C3H/He J mice showed a moderate inhibitory activity against Candida growth in vitro. The anti-Candida activity of the macrophages was augmented by the addition of TJ-48 or some component extracts of TJ-48 to the incubation medium. Among such active component extracts is an extract of Ginseng radix which was demonstrated to enhance the anti-Candida activity of macrophages in vitro and to prolong the survival time of C. albicans-infected C3H/He J mice without effect on C3H/He N mice. On the base of these findings, the mechanisms underlying the protective action of TJ-48 against systemic Candida infection was discussed in relation with its possible activity to activate the macrophage function."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Teikyo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Akagawa", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abe", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tansho", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Uchida", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamaguchi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8800150", "ISSNLinking": "0892-3973"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "juzentaihoto"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Candida albicans"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "immunology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Candidiasis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Susceptibility"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Immunity, Innate"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Peritoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C3H"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8683040", "10.3109/08923979609007111"]}}]}
