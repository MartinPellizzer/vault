In this investigation, the uterotonic properties of extracts from this tree were evaluated using both pregnant and non-pregnant guinea pig uterine smooth muscle in vitro. The extracts were prepared using water modified supercritical carbon dioxide at 400 atm and 80 degrees C. As samples of these extracts displayed positive results when screened for uterotonic activity, gravity column chromatography followed by NMR spectroscopy was performed in an attempt to isolate and elucidate the structures of the compounds that were present in the extract. The extract yielded five known compounds of which only two, viz. oleanonic acid and 3-epioleanolic acid, displayed uterotonic activity. Receptor binding assays were subsequently performed with 3-epioleanolic acid to ascertain its mode of action. Bradykinin (30 ng/100 microl) and acetylcholine (1 microg/100 microl) were used as the B2 and cholinergic receptor agonists respectively with icatibant (HOE 140) (30 ng/100 microl) and atropine (60 micro/100 microl) as their corresponding antagonists. 3-epioleanolic acid was observed to mediate its effect through the cholinergic receptor. The results of this study show that two compounds from the extract of this tree possess varying degrees of agonist activity on uterine smooth muscle with minor changes in the molecular structure affecting its intrinsic activity on uterine muscle."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Applied Chemistry, University of Natal, Durban, South Africa. vikash.sewram@mrc.ac.za"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sewram", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Raynor", "ForeName": "M W", "Initials": "MW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mulholland", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Raidoo", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Biomed Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "8309336", "ISSNLinking": "0731-7085"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptor, Bradykinin B2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Bradykinin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Cholinergic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "HPE317O9TL", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrilamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrilamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Receptor, Bradykinin B2"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Bradykinin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Cholinergic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Uterine Contraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11108547", "10.1016/s0731-7085(00)00404-0", "S0731-7085(00)00404-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
