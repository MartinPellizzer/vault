The availability of modern medicine is limited; medicines cost more than some people can afford to pay; pharmacies, hospitals and clinics are often located far away from communities; many drugs are difficult to find or unavailable in some parts of the world. Home remedies are, in many cases, a practical alternative to modern drugs. Dr. John, a physician trained at Christian Medical College Hospital in India, now directs the World Neighbors-assisted health program in an Indian community. She and her staff of 18 village health workers diagnose and treat 80% of their neighbors health problems with home remedies and simple medications. She cites several reasons for supporting home remedies: there is little danger of misuse or overuse of drugs; since the same home remedies are used in different countries, this is a good indication that they are effective; many of the plants used in home remedies are used to produce modern medicines; and community-wide attention to health results when people participate in solving their own health problems. Home remedies should be used only in the early stages of illness and not in its chronic form. To learn more about treating health problems with home remedies, a filmstrip on medicinal plants is recommended."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["21043cr986", "00162467"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: WORLD NEIGHBORS IN ACTION"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Asia", "Community Health Services", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Health", "Health Services", "India", "Indigenous Health Services", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Plants, Medicinal", "Primary Health Care", "Recommendations", "Southern Asia"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12314442", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1987", "Month": "04", "Day": "16"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "04"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"JournalIssue": {"Volume": "18", "Issue": "2E", "PubDate": {"Year": "1986"}}, "Title": "World Neighbors in action", "ISOAbbreviation": "World Neighb Action"}, "ArticleTitle": "Home remedies: health care at the doorstep.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "1", "EndPage": "4", "MedlinePgn": "1-4"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "CollectiveName": "World Neighbors"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "World Neighb Action", "NlmUniqueID": "101088506"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Community Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Planning Guidelines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services, Indigenous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Primary Health Care"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12314442"]}}]}
