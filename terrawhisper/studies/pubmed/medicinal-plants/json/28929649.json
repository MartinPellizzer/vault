HPLC was used to analyze three main characteristic components including tenuifolin, polygalaxanthone \u2162, and 3,6'-disinapoyl sucrose. At last, the correlation between six agronomic traits and three main characteristic components were analyzed by scatter plot. We found no significant correlation between root diameter and three main characteristic components. There were no obvious correlations between tenuifolin and the remaining five agronomic traits. Short root length and first lateral root height as well as high lateral root amount resulted in high levels of polygalaxanthone \u2162 in P. tenuifolia samples. High levels of 3,6'-disinapoyl sucrose were observed in P. tenuifolia samples with longer root. So, the current commodity criteria and traditional breeding of P. tenuifolia did not conform to pharmacopoeia standards, which excellent medicinal materials should have high contents of the main characteristic components. It was urgent to revise the current commodity criteria and breeding methods."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanxi University, Taiyuan 030006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shanxi University, Taiyuan 030006, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dan-Dan", "Initials": "DD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanxi University, Taiyuan 030006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shanxi University, Taiyuan 030006, China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanxi University, Taiyuan 030006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shanxi University, Taiyuan 030006, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Shuang", "Initials": "XS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanxi University, Taiyuan 030006, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Fu-Sheng", "Initials": "FS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanxi University, Taiyuan 030006, China."}], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Scientific Instrument Center, Shanxi University, Taiyuan 030006, China."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Jin-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Industrial Crop, Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Fenyang 032200, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Hong-Ling", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanxi University, Taiyuan 030006, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Xue-Mei", "Initials": "XM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "3,6'-disinapoylsucrose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes, Kaurane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "polygalaxanthone III"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-50-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Sucrose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "tenuifolin diterpene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "tenuifolic saponin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes, Kaurane"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Polygala"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sucrose"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthones"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28929649", "10.4268/cjcmm20162006"]}}]}
