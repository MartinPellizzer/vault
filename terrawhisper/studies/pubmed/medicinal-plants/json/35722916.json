The functions of 'Baiwei' are strengthening myocardial contraction, detoxifying, and as a diuretic; thus it is one of very important herbs in China (Yunsi Su et al. 2021). With the increasing need for this herbal medicine in China, farmers are trying to cultivate the wild type of 'Baiwei'. In 2019, we found severe crop damage in a second-year planting of 'Baiwei' with many dead plants in a field (Fig. S1A, B) in Mengyin County of Shandong Province, China. Root galls were clearly seen in the roots and the typical root-knot nematode (<i>Meloidogyne</i> spp.) symptoms were observed (Fig. S1C). The previous crop was peanut. Peanut is widely planted in Shandong Province and peanut root-knot nematode (<i>M. arenaria</i>) is one of its major root-knot nematode pests. We suspected that the damage was caused by peanut root-knot nematode. The roots were taken to the lab and kept at 10\u2103 for morphological and molecular identification of root-knot nematodes, and pathogenicity testing. Twenty females were picked up from the infected roots for perineal pattern observation. The perineal pattern had distinct characteristics such as a low dorsal arch and lateral field marked by forked and broken striae and without punctate markings between the anus and tail terminus (Fig. S2A), which is similar to the description of <i>M. arenaria</i> (Eisenback et al., 1981). Eggs were extracted from roots and hatched to second-stage juveniles (J2s). The morphometric characters of J2s (n = 30) demonstrated body length = 437.35 \u00b1 SE 3.51 \u00b5m, body width = 16.74 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b5m, stylet length = 11.31 \u00b1 0.20 \u00b5m, DGO = 3.87 \u00b1 0.07 \u00b5m, tail length = 53.32 \u00b1 0.99 \u00b5m, and hyaline tail terminus = 11.14 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b5m. The universal primer 194/195 (5.8S-18S rDNA TTAACTTGCCAGATCGGACG/TCTAATGAGCCGTACGC) for confirmation of Meloidogyne spp. was chosen and the sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) PCR specific markers for <i>M. incognita</i> (Finc/Rinc GGGATGTGTAAATGCTCCTG/CCCGCTACACCCTCAACTTC), <i>M. javanica</i> (Fjav/Rjav ACGCTAGAATTCGACCCTGG/GGTACCAGAAGCAGCCATGC), <i>M. enterolobii</i> (Fent/Rent GAAATTGCTTTATTGTTACTAAG/TAGCCACAGCAAAATAGTTTTC), <i>M. arenaria</i> (Fare/Rare TCGGCGATAGAGGTAAATGAC/TCGGCGATAGACACTACAACT), <i>M. hapla</i> (Fhap/Rhap TGACGGCGGTGAGTGCGA/TGACGGCGGTACCTCATAG) and <i>M. chitwoodi</i> (Fchi/Rchi TGGAGAGCAGCAGGAGAAAGA/GGTCTGAGTGAGGACAAGAGTA) were utilized for species identification (Mao et al., 2019). PCR products of J2 amplification were run in the agar gel (Fig. S2B). A PCR product of 750 bp was obtained for 194/195 primer pair and a 420 bp band was identified for <i>M. arenaria</i> for all tested J2 samples. There were no bands for other specific primers. The amplicons from 194/195 and <i>M. arenaria</i> primer pairs were sequenced. A 100% identity of the Fare/Rare sequence (MZ522722.1) with <i>M. arenaria</i> KP234264.1 and a 99.8% identity with <i>M. arenaria</i> MW315990.1 were found through NCBI blast. A 100% identity of the 194/195 sequence (MZ555753.1) with both <i>M. arenaria</i> GQ395518.1 and U42342.1 and <i>M. thailandica</i> HF568829.1. To confirm the pathogenicity, 2000 J2s obtained from the same population as described above were used to inoculate each plant of one-month old 'Baiwei' seedlings (n = 5) and of one-month-old tomato cv. 'Zhongshu4' seedlings (n = 5) growing in 15-cm-diameter and 10-cm-height plastic pot containing sand and soil (2:1 ratio) in the glasshouse at 22-28\u2103 and 16/8 h day/night. Plants without J2s were used as control. Sixty days later, roots were stained with erioglaucine (Omwega et al. 1988) and an average of 107 \u00b1 SE 59 and 276 \u00b1 SE 31 egg masses per gram root were produced in each infected 'Baiwei' (Fig. S3A) and tomato (Fig. S3B) root, respectively. PCR amplification of the hatched J2s reconfirmed the reproduced nematode in 'Baiwei' and tomato was <i>M. arenaria</i>.
