Rats were divided into a normal group and an FD model group. The FD model was induced by oral administration of ice hydrochloric acid combined with irregular feeding. The C. auriculatum extract was administered orally at a dose of 1 g\u00b7kg~(-1). The rat urine and feces were collected at 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 84 h for UPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. The differences in excretion of the four components were compared between normal and FD rats. The results showed that except for the baishouwu benzophenone in the feces, the components such as qingyangshengenin in the urine and feces did not reach the plateau value within 84 h. Qingyangshengenin was mainly excreted through defecation, and the cumulative excretion rates in the normal state and FD were 0.32% and 0.66%, respectively. Deacylmetaplexigenin was mainly excreted through urination, and the cumulative excretion rates in the normal state and FD were 6.70% and 7.56%, respectively. Baishouwu benzophenone was mainly excreted through defecation in the normal state, but mainly excreted through urination in the FD state, with cumulative excretion rates of 0.41% and 0.52%, respectively. Scopoletin was mainly excreted through urination, with cumulative excretion rates of 0.83% and 2.13% in the normal state and FD, respectively. In general, the components were mainly excreted in the urine in the FD state. Compared with the normal group, the FD group showed decreased cumulative excretion rates of qingyangshengenin, baishouwu benzophenone, and scopoletin in the urine(P&lt;0.05). Therefore, FD had a certain influence on the excretion of the main components of C. auriculatum extract, and the excretion of each component through urination and defecation was low, suggesting that there might be a wide range of metabolic pathways after oral administration and components were mainly excreted in the form of metabolites. This experiment provides a reference for the new drug development and clinical application of C. auriculatum."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Gou", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Li-Qin", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chun-Hua", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yue-Ting", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Zi-Peng", "Initials": "ZP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "KLF1HS0SXJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Scopoletin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cynanchum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dyspepsia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Scopoletin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "23"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36604880", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220621.202"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
