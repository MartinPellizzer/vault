Women could be both teachers and students and made significant contributions to its abundant scientific production. One of the most important of such women was Trotula of Salerno, the 12th century author of the Passionibus mulierum curandorum. De secretis mulierum, de chirurgia et de modo medendi libri septem is an anonymous medical poem from the School of Salerno, which was discovered in a manuscript from the 13th century. It consists of seven books and 7280 dactylic hexameters. The first book is specifically devoted to women's diseases and the second is a treaty on cosmetics. Books III and IV deal with surgery and follow the classical a capite ad calcem formula. The seventh book, De modo medendi, deals with therapeutics. We review the references to neurological diseases, using a critical translation of this text to carry out our study.", "The poem proposes therapies to treat epilepsy, headache or tinnitus. The treatment to be prescribed for headache differs depending on its origin. It puts forward pathophysiological explanations for the different types of headache, it relates engorged blood vessels with hemicranial headache, and suggests an excess of phlegm as the origin of mild occipital headache.", "Neurological pathology is well represented in this mediaeval monograph on women's diseases. Furthermore, it also shows us the vision that the Salerno physician has of these conditions and the therapeutic arsenal (based mainly on medicinal plants) that was available for use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Servicio de Neurolog\u00eda, Hospital Cl\u00ednico Universitario de Valladolid, Valladolid, Espa\u00f1a. gueneurol@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guerrero-Peral", "ForeName": "Angel L", "Initials": "AL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Frutos-Gonz\u00e1lez", "ForeName": "Virginia", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "De secretis mulierum, de chirurgia et de modo medendi libri septem.
