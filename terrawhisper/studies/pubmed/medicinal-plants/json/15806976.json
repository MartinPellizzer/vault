Cells at period of logarithmic growth were incubated for 24 hours. Then total alkaloid of various concentrations were added. 24 hours later, supernatant was removed and MTT was added. 4 hours after that, DMSO was added, then 30 minutes later, A value was measured. In vivo, suspension of carcinoma cells was implanted in the mice's limbs subcutaneously, 0.2mL each. 24 hours later, the mice were grouped randomly. Fed by total alkaloid continuously for 7 days, the mice were sacrificed. The tumors were weighed and calculated the inhibitory rates.", "In vitro, it shows that total alkaloid has prominent inhibitory effect on the growth of carcinoma cells.
