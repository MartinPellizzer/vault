Scientific research has now been focusing on novel medicines to overcome bacterial resistance and antibiotics side effects; therefore, the current study was designed to assess the efficacy of certain antibiotics, toothpaste, and medicinal plant extracts (Ajuga bracteosa and Curcuma longa) versus the bacterial pathogens isolated from the human oral cavity. A total of 130 samples were collected from Khyber Teaching Hospital Peshawar, Pakistan, among those 27 species isolated, and eight bacterial species were identified from the samples. Among all the bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus (29.62%) and Proteus mirabilis (22.2%) were found to be more prevalent oral pathogens. In comparison, the least pervasive microbes were Proteus vulgaris, Shigella sonnei, Escherichia coli and Aeromonas hydrophila. The study also suggested that dental problems were more prevalent in males (41-50 years of age) than females. Among the eight antibiotics used in the study, the most promising results were shown by Foxicillin against A. hydrophila. The survey of TP1 revealed that it showed more potent antagonist activity against Proteus vulgaris as compared TP2 and TP3 that might be due to the high content of fluoride. The Curcuma longa showed more significant activity than Ajuga bracteosa (Stem, leaves and root) extracts. The data obtained through this study revealed that antibiotics were more effective for oral bacterial pathogens than toothpaste and plant extracts which showed moderate and low activity, respectively. Therefore, it is suggested that the active compounds in individual medicinal plants like Curcuma longa and Ajuga bracteosa could replace the antibiotics when used in daily routine as tooth cleansers or mouth rinses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5524-9765"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Women University, Department of Microbiology, Peshawar, Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Sheffield, Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Sheffield, UK."}], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3658-9729"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Sheffield, Department of Biomedical Science, Sheffield, UK."}], "LastName": "Shafique", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1586-1949"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ajman University, Department of Dentistry, Ajman, UAE."}], "LastName": "Bhutta", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6152-3935"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NCS University System, Department of Health Sciences, Peshawar, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Haq", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5653-3533"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Sheffield, Department of Neuroscience - SITraN, Sheffield, UK."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Abdul Aziz University, Department of Applied Medical Science (Medical Laboratory), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Almansouri", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9233-5681"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Agriculture, Institute of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Division of Genomics and Bioinformatics, Peshawar, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Asim", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3521-4995"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "De'Montmorency College of Dentistry Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3631-3354"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Women University, Department of Microbiology, Peshawar, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Butt", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6594-3603"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Abbottabad University of Science and Technology, Department of Microbiology, Abbottabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2203-4933"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hazara University Mansehra, Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering , Hazara, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akbar", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101129542", "ISSNLinking": "1519-6984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toothpastes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q80VPU408O", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toothpastes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "24"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34320048", "10.1590/1519-6984.242703", "S1519-69842023000100138"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
