Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) requires a large amount of phosphorus (P). The purpose of this study was to isolate the CsPT2-1 from cucumber roots, and to determine the influence of Pi nutrition on cucumber growth, metabolism and transcript levels of CsPT2-1 in tissues. Full length CsPT2-1 was cloned and phylogenetically identified. In two greenhouse experiments, P-deficient seedlings provided with low or high P concentrations were sampled at 10 and 21 days post treatment, respectively. Addition of P dramatically reduced growth of roots but not shoots. Supplying plants with high P resulted in increased total protein in leaves. Acid phosphatase activity increased significantly in leaves at any rate higher than 4\u202fmM\u202fP. Increasing P concentration had a notable decrease in glucose concentrations in leaves of plants supplied with >0.5\u202fmM\u202fP. In roots, glucose and starch concentrations increased with increasing P supply. Steady-state transcript levels of CsPT2-1 were high in P-deprived roots, but declined when plants were provided >10\u202fmM\u202fP. To our knowledge, this is the first report focusing on a PT and its expression levels in cucumber."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
