Phenylethanoid glycosides are indicative components for identification and content determination of Desertliving Cistanche herb in Chinese pharmacopoeia, which is also one of the main active components. In this research, we explored the mechanism of phenylethanoid glycosides of Desertliving Cistanche herb to the perimenopausal model rats.", "The purpose of this study is to research the effects of phenylethanoid glycosides of Desertliving Cistanche herb (PGC) on the neuroendocrine-immune function of perimenopausal syndrome by perimenopausal model rats.", "Wistar female rats were selected. The left ovaries for all rats except in the blank control group(BC) were removed, and the right ovaries were removed in 80%. The vaginal smear showed irregular estrous cycle changes for the perimenopausal model rats. And the perimenopausal model rats were gavaged Gengnian'an, Phenylethanoid Glycosides of Desertliving Cistanche herb high, medium, low suspension which is 450mg/(kg day), 133.33mg/(kg day), 66.67mg/(kg day), 33.33mg/(kg day); the group of BC and model group (MC)were given distilled water in the same volume as the drugs group for 30 consecutive days. Horizontal-vertical exercise scores were measured at 29 days of dosing. After the last administration, the blood was taken from the abdominal aorta, and levels of E<sub>2</sub>, LH, FSH, GnRH, BGP in serum, and the levels \u03b2-EP in plasma were measured respective. Organ indexes of thymus, spleen, and uterus were calculated. The content of estrogen receptor (ER) in the hypothalamic, pituitary and uterus tissues and the content of androgen receptor (AR) in the hypothalamic homogenate were measured. The pathological changes of the thymus, spleen, uterus, ovary were observed by HE staining.", "Compared with MC, PGC increase the activity, the organ index (thymus, spleen, uterus), E<sub>2</sub>, T, BGP level in serum, \u03b2-EP level in plasma, AR level in hypothalamus, ER level in hypothalamus, pituitary, uterus in perimenopausal model rats. And it also reduced FSH, LH, GnRH level in serum, and improved uterine and ovarian lesions in perimenopausal model rats.", "Each dose of PCG could counteract the disorder of sex hormone in perimenopausal model rats, correct the imbalance of ER and AR level, enhance and restore the effect of uterus and the nerve cells of hypothalamic, and improve immune function."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
