This study aimed to identify potential therapeutic compounds and phytochemicals of medicinal plants that have potential to modulate the expression network of genes that are involve in SARS-CoV-2 pathology in human host and to understand the dynamics key proteins involved in the virus-host interactions. The method used include gene network analysis, molecular docking, and sequence and structure dynamics simulations. The results identified DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and Protein kinase CK2 as key players in SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle. Among the predicted drugs compounds, clemizole, monorden, spironolactone and tanespimycin showed high binding energies; among the studied repurposing compounds, remdesivir, simeprevir and valinomycin showed high binding energies; among the predicted acidic compounds, acetylursolic acid and hardwickiic acid gave high binding energies; while among the studied anthraquinones and glycosides compounds, ellagitannin and friedelanone showed high binding energies against 3-Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL<sup>pro</sup>), Papain-like protease (PL<sup>pro</sup>), helicase (nsp13), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase (nsp16) of SARS-CoV-2 and DNA-PK and CK2alpha in human. The order of affinity for CoV proteins is 5Y3E > 6NUS > 6JYT > 2XYR > 3VB6. Finally, medicinal plants with phytochemicals such as caffeine, ellagic acid, quercetin and their derivatives could possibly remediate COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
