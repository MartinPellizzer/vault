Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (RAS) is equal to the black bile and phlegmatic types and minor aphthous type can be matched with phlegmatic type. The corrosive propagated lesions can be herpetic aphthous. In modern medicine, M. communis essential oil and its decoction decreased the average time of pain relief and decreased the size of ulcers in patients with minor RAS without any adverse effects. The number of ulcers was not the subjects of any different clinical trials. All patients were satisfied with M. communis topical essential oil (5%), and 81% patients were satisfied with M. communis topical decoctions (5%). It appears the efficacy of M. communis is related to its analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and wound healing effects.", "M. communis is effective in minor RAS as its traditional claims and confirming its efficacy in major and herpetiform RAS and comparing the efficacy of its decoction topical formulations or essential oil topical ones are required more and larger experimental and clinical investigations in future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
