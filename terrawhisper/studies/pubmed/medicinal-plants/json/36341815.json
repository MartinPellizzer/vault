Since the cause of vitiligo has not been determined, no satisfactory treatment is available. Clinical interventions include pharmacological treatment with psoralen, usually in conjunction with ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation, but toxic side effects limit this application. Studies on the activity and mechanisms of ALLHP are scarce.", "To verify the therapeutic effect of ALLHP on vitiligo and determine its effectiveness as a theoretical and experimental basis for the development of innovative drugs with independent intellectual property rights and the effective use of local resources.", "The experimental animal model of vitiligo was established by chemical decoloring. Rats were treated with gradient doses of ALLHP. The therapeutic effect was judged by gross observation. The contents of TYR, MAO, AchE and MDA in serum and skin tissue, the number of hair follicles containing melanin in skin tissue, the distribution of epidermal melanin, and the weight index of immune organs were detected, and the therapeutic effect of ALLHP on vitiligo was evaluated. In addition, certain monomer components in ALLHP were used to intervene in the zebrafish juvenile melanin suppression model, and the melanin-activating activities of some monomer components in ALLHP were screened by counting the melanin area ratio.", "ALLHP increased the number of melanin-containing hair follicles and the epidermal melanin content in the skin of experimental vitiligo animals, repaired the skin cell morphology to a certain extent, increased the content of TYR in serum and skin, and reduced the content of MDA, AchE and MAO. Carvone, Luteolin, Psoralen and Psoraleae phenol and Bakuchiol could increase the melanin area of experimental melanin inhibition in zebrafish.", "According to the results of this study, ALLHP can increase the number of melanin-containing hair follicles and the epidermal melanin content in the skin of vitiligo animals and restore skin cell morphology to a certain extent by reducing oxidative stress in epidermal tissue. A wide range of active ingredients may promote melanogenesis with ALLHP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
