(Spanish sage) extracts and constituents have demonstrated anticholinesterase, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, oestrogenic and CNS depressant (sedative) effects all of which are currently relevant to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The essential oil inhibits the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from human brain tissue and bovine erythrocyte and individual monoterpenoid constituents inhibit AChE with varying degrees of potency. In vivo AChE inhibition of select brain (striatal and hippocampal over cortical) AChE was obtained following oral administration of the essential oil to rats. In a study in healthy volunteers essential oil administration produced significant effects on cognition. In a pilot open-label study involving oral administration of the essential oil to patients with AD, a significant increase in diastolic and systolic blood pressure was observed in two patients, however this may have been due primarily to preexisting hypertension and there were no abnormalities in other vital signs or blood samples during the trial period. Although an open label trial is not free from practice effects or rater-caregiver expectations, statistically significant differences between baseline and 6 weeks treatment were a reduction in neuropsychiatric symptoms and an improvement in attention."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Perry", "ForeName": "Nicolette S L", "Initials": "NS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bollen", "ForeName": "Chloe", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Perry", "ForeName": "Elaine K", "Initials": "EK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ballard", "ForeName": "Clive", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacol Biochem Behav", "NlmUniqueID": "0367050", "ISSNLinking": "0091-3057"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.8", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia"}], "NumberOfReferences": "70"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12895683", "10.1016/s0091-3057(03)00108-4", "S0091305703001084"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
