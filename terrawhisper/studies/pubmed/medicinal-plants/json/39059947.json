Results shown that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-NS-L promoted surimi printability due to enhanced gel strength and denser structure. Mixing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-NS-L endowed printed surimi with antioxidation (DPPH, ABTS, hydroxyl radical, Fe<sup>2+</sup> reduction were 42\u00a0%, 79\u00a0%, 65\u00a0%, 0.104\u00a0mg\u00b7mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively) due to the ability of lutein with more -OH groups and conjugate bonds to capture free radicals. It also manifested in cellular antioxidation that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-NS-L-surimi regulated the level of Nrf2 to protect gene expression of antioxidases (SOD, CAT, GSH-Px increased by 30-180\u00a0%, compared to damaged cells) through keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway. Additionally, lutein absorption and transportation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-NS-L-surimi increased by 20\u00a0%, compared to NS-L. Possibly, combination of samples and membrane was facilitated by surface hydrophobic, promoting endocytosis. Meanwhile, digestive surimi (peptides) with acidic-alkaline amino acids and negative charges made samples be attracted and moved in bypass parts under electrostatic traction and repulsion (electrostatic domain) to promote transport process. Also, Ca<sup>2+</sup> facilitated CaM expression in membrane and formed Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel by combining with CaM to accelerate entry of samples into cells. Conclusively, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-NS-L both strengthened printability of surimi and antioxidation, promoting application of printed functional surimi."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
