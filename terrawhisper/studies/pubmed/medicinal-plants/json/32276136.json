This study investigated anti-type 2 diabetic potential and active component of Scrophularia flava Grau. A new phenylethanoid glycoside was isolated from aerial parts of the plant and identified as 2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) ethyl 6-deoxy-3-O-[(2E)-3-(3 hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl) prop-2-enoyl]-\u03b1-rhamnopyranosyl-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a03)-[\u03b1-rhamnopyranosyl-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a06)]-4-O-[(2E)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) prop-2-enoyl]-\u03b2-glucopyranoside. It was named flavaioside. The structure of flavaioside was identified based on <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, DEPT-HSQC, COSY, HMBC, NOESY and LC-ESI-MS-MS. Total methanol extract, fractions (A-F) and specific main phenylethanoid glycoside (flavaioside), were assessed for inhibitory effects against the \u03b1-glucosidase enzyme (in vitro anti-type 2 diabetic assay). The antioxidant activities of methanol extracts, all fractions and isolated flavaioside were identified based on 2, 2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) scavenging activity, 2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulphonic acid radical cation (ABTS<sup>+</sup>) scavenging activity, phosphomolybdenum method, and metal chelating activity. In comparison to the other fractions, the best antioxidant result was observed in fraction E and its main compound, flavaioside, in DPPH (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a04.26, 2.57\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) and ABTS<sup>+</sup> (EC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a055.45, 6.34\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) scavenging activities. Flavaioside showed significantly stronger activities than \u03b1-tocopherol and ascorbic acid in DPPH and ABTS<sup>+</sup> assays. Furthermore, flavaioside showed a potent inhibitory activity on the \u03b1-glucosidase enzyme which was comparable with the known anti-type 2 diabetic drug, acarbose (91.85%, and 92.87%, respectively). Fraction E and flavaioside showed \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities with IC<sub>50</sub> values, 65.05 and 6.50\u00a0\u00b5g/mL. The plant and its isolated flavaioside can possess acceptable anti-type 2 diabetic potential and anti-oxidant activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
