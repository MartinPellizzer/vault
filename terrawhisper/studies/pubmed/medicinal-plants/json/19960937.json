There was positive relativity between the rate of fertilization of ovule and the rate of fructify and this indicated the different heredity character among plants. The weight of fruit was mainly decided by the weight of seed regiment, The more the seed quantity, the larger the weight of seed regiment, and the larger the weight of fruit, then the higher the yield. The variety of the weight of fruit and the quantity of seed presented peak form along with the proper order of fruit growth in inflorescence but had no relativity.", "The abundant quantitative multistate character of fruit and seed of Amomum tsaoko provide the abundant materials for selecting good varieties. For high yield we should not only choose plants with high rate of fructify and high rate of fertilization of ovule the, but also pay attention to the influence of pollination to yield."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650204, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yao-Wen", "Initials": "YW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Li", "Initials": "XL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pu", "ForeName": "Chun-Xia", "Initials": "CX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jia-Long", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Zi-Gang", "Initials": "ZG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Amomum"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19960937"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
