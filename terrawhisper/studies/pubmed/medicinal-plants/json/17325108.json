African-American women were less likely to use complementary and alternative therapies in general, compared with non-Hispanic white women. Other factors significantly associated with use of complementary and alternative medicine in general included being employed, being single, and having self-perceived poor health. The relationships between the sociodemographic factors and use of each of the three individually examined types of therapies differed from their relationships with use of complementary and alternative medicine in general. Participants' most commonly cited reasons for use of these therapies were wanting treatments to be based on a \"natural approach,\" wanting treatments to be congruent with their own values and beliefs, and past experiences in which conventional medical therapies had caused unpleasant side effects or had seemed ineffective.", "It is important for mental health and other health professionals to increase their own awareness of the types of complementary and alternative therapies that their patients may be using and to improve communication with their patients about the benefits and potential risks of these therapies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, 1051 Riverside Dr., Unit 43, New York, NY 10032, USA. wup@childpsych.columbia.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fuller", "ForeName": "Cordelia", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xinhua", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hsin-Chien", "Initials": "HC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hoven", "ForeName": "Christina W", "Initials": "CW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mandell", "ForeName": "Donald", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wade", "ForeName": "Christine", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kronenberg", "ForeName": "Fredi", "Initials": "F"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01-HD-37073", "Acronym": "HD", "Agency": "NICHD NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "U24-HD-3319-93", "Acronym": "HD", "Agency": "NICHD NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Psychiatr Serv", "NlmUniqueID": "9502838", "ISSNLinking": "1075-2730"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Attitude to Health"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depressive Disorder, Major"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Musculoskeletal Manipulations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17325108", "10.1176/ps.2007.58.3.349", "58/3/349"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
