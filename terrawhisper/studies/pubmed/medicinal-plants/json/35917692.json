The collected field tick populations were resistant to DLM (Resistance Factor [RF] in the range of 21.71-32.98) and IVM (RF in the range of 1.89-4.98). A strong synergism between DLM and, IVM with PBO and IVM with VER was noticed. The synergistic efficacy of PBO and VER with IVM in reducing the lethal concentration 50 (LC50) value (1.69-5.72 times for PBO and 3.00-10.62 times for VER) of IVM in resistant ticks suggest that a combination of these synergists with IVM can significantly enhance the effectiveness of IVM against IVM-resistant Rhipicephlaus microplus populations gradually establishing in the different parts of the country. The synergistic efficiency of PBO with DLM in reducing the LC50 value was 2.65 and 18.01 times, respectively, against DLM- resistant two R. microplus populations (KTN and LDH). The study revealed the gradual establishment of DLM and IVM resistant populations in the surveyed states suggesting the need to adopt required resistance management strategies. The use of synergists with DLM and IVM has emerged as an effective approach for controlling the acaricide-resistant ticks."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
