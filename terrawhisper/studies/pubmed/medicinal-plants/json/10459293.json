Its clinical use, however, is limited because of various side effects including sensorineural hearing loss. Several agents have been proposed to reduce these side effects. GBE has recently been reported to scavenge superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, resulting in a reduction of lipid peroxidation. GBE is expected to protect against CDDP-induced toxicity because its generative mechanism is thought to be associated with free-radical formation. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate GBE's efficacy as a protective agent against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. Fisher rats were used in this study and were divided into three treatment groups: 1) animals administered 1.0 mg of CDDP per kg for 10 days (Group I), 2) animals receiving 100 mg of GBE per kg 90 min before administration 1.0 mg of CDDP per kg (Group II) and 3) a vehicle control (Group III). First, the protective effect of GBE on CDDP-induced ototoxicity was investigated. The auditory threshold was evaluated by means of the compound action potential (CAP) recording. After CAP recordings, cochlear sensory epithelia were observed throughout the cochlea by scanning electron microscopy. In Group II, the elevation of CAP thresholds at 12 kHz, 16 kHz, 20 kHz and the missing rate for the outer hair cells were significantly reduced as compared to those in Group I. These data suggest that GBE is effective for otoprotection against CDDP. Second, the protective effect of GBE on CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity was evaluated. Nephrotoxicity was evaluated by means of measurement of serum BUN and creatinine and histopathological examination of the kidney. These were significant differences in serum BUN and creatinine levels between Group I and Group II. Third, the influence of GBE against the antitumor effect of CDDP was researched in the rats inoculated subcutaneously with SCC-158 squamous cell carcinoma cells. There was no difference in tumor growth rate (TGR) between Group I and Group II. The result suggested that the combined administration had no influence on the antitumor activity of CDDP. In conclusion, the co-administration of CDDP with GBE is beneficial to ameliorate CDDP-induced toxicity without attenuation of CDDP antitumor activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine."}], "LastName": "Fukaya", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kanno", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nihon Jibiinkoka Gakkai Kaiho", "NlmUniqueID": "7505728", "ISSNLinking": "0030-6622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q20Q21Q62J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cisplatin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cisplatin"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hearing Loss, Sensorineural"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10459293", "10.3950/jibiinkoka.102.907"]}}]}
