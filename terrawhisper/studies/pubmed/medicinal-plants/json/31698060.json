Based on the biosynthetic pathway of some alkaloids such as C19-diterpenoid alkaloids and obvious differences in alkaloid content between leaves of two A. carmichaelii varieties has been reported, we performed leaves transcriptome analysis of two A. carmichaelii varieties. Besides we characterized the biosynthetic pathway of salsolinol. A total of 56 million raw reads (8.28\u202fG) and 55 million clean reads (8.24\u202fG) were obtained from two varieties (Z175 and R184) leaves transcriptome, respectively, and 176,793 unigenes were annotated. 281 and 843 unigenes are involved in the salsolinol biosynthetic pathway and the formation of C19-diterpenoid alkaloids respectively. And including 34 and 24 unigenes are the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the biosynthesis pathway for C19-diterpenoid alkaloids and salsolinol between Z175 and R184 respectively, which were target genes to explore differences in C19-diterpenoid alkaloid and salsolinol biosynthesis in Z175 and R184. Thus genes involved in alkaloid biosynthesis and accumulation differ between varieties leaves. The mechanisms underlying the differences and their relevance require further exploration. The results expand our knowledge of alkaloids biosynthesis in A. carmichaelii leaves, and provide a theoretical basis for analysis differences in alkaloids biosynthesis patterns in different varieties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
