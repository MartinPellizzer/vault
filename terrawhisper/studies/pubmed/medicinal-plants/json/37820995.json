Yunnanensis (Franch.) Hand.-Mazz., a perennial medicinal herb commonly known as \"Chonglou\" in Chinese, is mainly effective against innominate toxin swelling, insect sting, snake bite, traumatic injuries and various inflammatory. It is also recorded with mild toxicity. The rare species Paris luquanensis H. Li has been also used as folk medicine in Yunnan province for the same effects. Compared with P. polyphylla var. Yunnanensis (35-100\u00a0cm in height), this species has variegated leaves, and grows slower and is therefore shorter (6-23\u00a0cm in height). There are a number of different cultivars based on the shape of the petal and the height of Paris plant. However, currently, investigations into the differences of the chemical profiling of these cultivars are lacking.", "This study aims to: (1) examine metabolites variations in Paris polyphylla var. Yunnanensis cultivars and Paris luquanensis; (2) investigate the different metabolite accumulation patterns between rhizomes and leaves and provide more useful information for the application of P. polyphylla var. Yunnanensis leaves; (3) compare in vivo effects on the recruitment of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Neutrophils and toxic effects in zebrafish model between leaves and rhizomes of P. polyphylla var. Yunnanensis and P. luquanensis.", "The change patterns of metabolites in the leaves and rhizomes of four P. polyphylla var. Yunnanensis cultivars and one P. luquanensis cultivar were analyzed using an UPLC-ESI-MS/MS system. The total phenolic acid, total flavonoid, total saponin components and in vitro antioxidant activities were determined by spectrophotometric methods. The in vivo toxicity and their effects on the recruitment of ROS and neutrophils in zebrafish model were performed.", "The widely targeted metabolomics method detected 695 metabolites in tested samples and classified as 15 known classes according to structures of the metabolites. By overall-comparing the SDMs discerned between leaves and rhizomes of each samples, 161 metabolites were substantially altered in all the cultivars. There are 62 and 64 SDMs showing constitutive differential accumulation between leaves and rhizomes of P. polyphylla var. Yunnanensis (samples A-D) and P. luquanensis (sample E), respectively. The levels of TSC, TPC and TFC decreased significantly in leaves as compared to rhizomes for all cultivars, with the exception of TPC in cultivar A, which is almost the same in leave and rhizome. The DPPH scavenging property and FRAP values of rhizomes are higher than those of leaves for all cultivars. However, there is no distinct different between leaves and rhizomes of different sample extracts for in vivo effects on the recruitment of ROS and neutrophils in zebrafish model. BL extracts showed high toxicity to the developing embryos.", "As far as we are concerned, this study analyzes the P. polyphylla var. Yunnanensis and P. luquanensis variegation from the perspective of the metabolites pattern for the first time. The results give a valuable insight into the specie metabolic profiling and in vivo anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and toxic effects of these Paris plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
