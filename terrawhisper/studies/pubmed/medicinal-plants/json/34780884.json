Recently, the first viroid was identified from D. officinale in China, and it has been named Dendrobium viroid (DVd). Whether DVd interferes with metabolic pathways in dendrobium plants and affects the medicinal value of the host is unknown. In this study, metabolomics data from stem tissues supported by transcriptome studies were used to investigate how metabolism modulate of D. officinale is altered by DVd infection. Our results show that metabolism of D. officinale is reprogrammed in many ways during DVd infection, and this is reflected by significant changes in the levels of flavonoids, alkaloids, and phenolic acids. Furthermore, we found that DVd infection significantly decreased the accumulation of flavonoids and alkaloid metabolites in infected stems, and the decreases in these metabolites appears to affect the medicinal components of the infected plants, weakening the host antiviral immune response as well. Conversely, phenolic acids occupy a larger proportion of the up-regulated metabolites from DVd infection in comparison with the mock-inoculated control, and the increase in the total phenolic acids may reflect the activation of the pathogen defense response in D. officinale. Taken together, our results provide an interesting overview and give a better understanding of the relationship between metabolism and DVd infection in the orchid D. officinale."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
