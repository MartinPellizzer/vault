Recent studies indicate the kiwiberry fruit could be an important source of many health-promoting compounds. A knowledge-based fertilisation concept was evolved to define optimal strategies for feeding Actinidia with nitrogen (N) because a deficit and excess of N both have a negative impact on plants and the surrounding environment.", "Kiwiberry yield and fruit internal quality significantly depended on soil N level, cultivar and growing season. A higher soil N led to an increase in carotenoid content and a decrease in phenolic content, whereas ascorbic acid and glutathione contents were not affected by soil N fertility. Under the highest N dose, enzymatic antioxidants were activated. Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity clearly decreased with an increasing N level.", "Competent and skilful fertilisation management should focus on balancing a high fruit yield and maintaining their high quality. Based on yield level and fruit antioxidant potential, the N guide values for A. arguta vary between 30 and 50\u2009mg N per kg<sup>-1</sup> of soil. The recommended N dose may depend on overall soil quality traits and cultivar N demand, as well as on weather conditions. \u00a9 2020 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Basic Research in Horticulture, Warsaw University of Life Sciences - SGGW, Warsaw, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Horticultural Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences - SGGW, Warsaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Stefaniak", "ForeName": "Jan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Horticultural Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences - SGGW, Warsaw, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Vegetable and Medicinal Plants, Warsaw University of Life Sciences - SGGW, Warsaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Przyby\u0142", "ForeName": "Jaros\u0142aw L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6282-7340"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Horticultural Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences - SGGW, Warsaw, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Protection and Dendrology, Warsaw University of Life Sciences - SGGW, Warsaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Latocha", "ForeName": "Piotr", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7128-7377"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Basic Research in Horticulture, Warsaw University of Life Sciences - SGGW, Warsaw, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Horticultural Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences - SGGW, Warsaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "\u0141ata", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "PBS3/A8/35/2015", "Agency": "National Centre for Research and Development (NCBiR) Poland", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Carotenoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Actinidia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carotenoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Crop Production"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Slacin JL and Lioyd B, Health benefits of fruits and vegetables.
