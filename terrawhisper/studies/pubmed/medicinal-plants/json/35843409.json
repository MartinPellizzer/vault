A healthy skin promotes a healthy body that can be achieved through modern, allopathic and natural medicines. Therefore, medicinal plants can be a reliable therapy in treating skin diseases in humans through a diverse range of bioactive molecules they contain.", "This review aims to provide for the first-time scientific evidence related to the dermatological properties of Morocco's medicinal plants and it aims to provide a baseline for the discovery of new drugs having activities against skin issues.", "This review involved an investigation with different search engines for Moroccan ethnobotanical surveys published between 1991 and 2021. The plants used to treat skin diseases have been determined. Information regarding pharmacological effects, phytochemical, and clinical trials related to the plants listed in this review was collected from different scientific databases like PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Web of Science and Scopus. The data were analyzed and summarized in the review.", "A total of 401 plants belonging to 86 families mainly represented by Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, Fabaceae, and Apiaceae which have been documented to be in common use by Moroccans for managing skin diseases. Among those plants recorded, the most commonly used are Allium cepa L, Chamaeleon gummifer (L.) Cass and Salvia rosmarinus Schleid. Mill. Leaves were the most commonly used plant part, while powder and decoction were the most common method of traditional drug preparation. 107 of the 401 plants (27%) have undergone pharmacological validation. A total of 44 compounds isolated from 27 plants were investigated to treat different types of skin diseases, and 25 plants have been clinically studied for their activities against skin diseases.", "The beneficial effects of using Moroccan medicinal plants to treat skin diseases, according to traditional practices, have been proven in numerous scientific studies. Therefore, other studies should focus on isolating and identifying specific bioactive compounds from plant extracts, revealing more valuable therapeutic properties. Furthermore, additional reliable clinical trials are needed to confirm their beneficial effect on patients with skin diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
