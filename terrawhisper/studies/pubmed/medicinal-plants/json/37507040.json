In the present investigation, the medical plant Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) has used in the synthesis of cobalt (Co) nanoparticles in a cost-effective, feasible process. The efficiency of nanoparticles in removing methyl orange dye was evaluated by analyzing their applications in wastewater treatment. An analysis of the anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties of Tulsi-mediated Co nanoparticles was conducted to examine their medical application. Morphological analysis of Co nanoparticles showed that the synthesized nanoparticles were in crystal shape with a mean particle size of 110\u00a0nm. A batch adsorption study has shown that incubation periods of 5\u00a0h, pH 2, temperatures of 70\u00a0\u00b0C, and adsorbent dosage of 125\u00a0\u03bcg/mL are optimal for removing methyl orange dye from wastewater. To examine the anti-inflammatory properties of Tulsi-mediated Co nanoparticles, protein denaturation and nitric oxide scavenging assays were performed. The maximum anti-inflammatory response was recorded at a concentration of 250\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of Co nanoparticles. MTT assays against MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were used to evaluate the anti-cancer properties of Co nanoparticles. This study investigates the economical extraction of Co nanoparticles from tulsi and its potential use in wastewater purification and biomedical applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
