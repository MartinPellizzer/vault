Endl. ex Walp (Opiliaceae)].", "The polysaccharides from the leaves of Opilia celtidifolia were isolated from water extracts of the leaves using gelfiltration and anion exchange chromatography giving the fractions Oc50A1 and Oc50A2. Monosaccharide composition was determined by gas chromatography of the derived TMS-derivatives of the methyl-glycosides. Linkages were determined of the partly methylated, partly acetylated alditol acetates obtained after a process including reduction, methylation, hydrolysis, reduction and acetylation followed by GC-MS. Effects on the complement system and the macrophages were determined using specific methods aimed for studying those activities.", "The polysaccharide fractions isolated from the leaves of Opilia celtidifolia has high complement fixing activity and induce nitrite oxide release from macrophages in a dose dependent manner. The fractions had an ICH50 of 0.5 and 0.9 microg/ml respectively in the complement fixing assay. They induced the release of 7.2 and 7.3 microM of nitrite oxide from macrophages respectively at a dose of 100 microg/ml. The monosaccharide composition in Oc50A1 and Oc50A2, analysed, showed the presence of arabinose (26.7 and 13.2%), galactose (31.5 and 28%) and galacturonic acid (5.3 and 7.8%) respectively. The Yariv test confirmed the presence of arabinogalactan type II in both fractions. Structural analyses did also show the presence of terminal and 1-4 linked galacturonic acid and terminal and 1-2 linked rhamnose. Endo-polygalacturonanase treatment was performed to isolate the heavily substituted parts of the polysaccharides. These parts contained the same monosaccharides in similar proportion, and showed stronger dose dependent complement fixing activity and also stimulated macrophages to release nitrite oxide.", "The leaves of Opilia celtidifola contains polysaccharides of pectic type that have both complement fixing and macrophage stimulating activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Pharmacognosy, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Oslo, P.O.
