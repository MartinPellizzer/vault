Plants obtained from natural habitats were grown in the greenhouse. The flowers were hand pollinated. Seeds of the capsules derived after 12 weeks of hand-pollination germinated asymbiotically (50-74%) on half strength Murashige and Skoog's (MS) basal medium with 3% sucrose and solidified with 0.9% Difco agar. Active growth in the germinated seedlings was achieved by re-culturing on full strength MS basal medium supplemented with 8% banana homogenate, 8% potato homogenate, 8% coconut water, 1.5% sucrose and 0.9% Difco agar. Healthy plantlets, transferred to plastic trays containing moss or moss and tree fern, successfully acclimatized (84-100%) in the greenhouse. A marked varied response was observed in the free radical scavenging activity of methanolic extracts of in vitro propagated plants, on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical using a UV spectrophotometer assay. Methanolic extracts were prepared by dissolving the powdered plant material, obtained from six months old in vitro propagated plants, each about 5 g, in boiling methanol. The percentage of scavenging effect of D. tosaense extract was 95.9% at 0.4 mg/ml concentration, whereas D. monoliforme, and D. linawianum extracts scavenged 83.4% and 92.3%, respectively, at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. All the extracts scavenged DPPH radical significantly in a concentration dependent manner."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy, Chiayi Agricultural Experiment Station, Agricultural Research Institute, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lo", "ForeName": "Shu-Fung", "Initials": "SF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nalawade", "ForeName": "Satish Manohar", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mulabagal", "ForeName": "Vanisree", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matthew", "ForeName": "Susan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chung-Li", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuo", "ForeName": "Chao-Lin", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsay", "ForeName": "Hsin-Sheng", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrazines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Symbiosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15133256", "10.1248/bpb.27.731"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
