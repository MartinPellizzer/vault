The results indicated that 2 241 species of medicinal plants existed in Jilin province, belonging to 881 genera of 243 families, with 20 dominant families and 3 dominant genera. There were 1 901 species of medicinal plants(belonging to 778 genera of 227 families) in the eastern mountainous region, 1 503 species(belonging to 690 genera of 225 families) in the mid-mountainous areas of the central mountainous region, and 811 species(belonging to 436 genera of 136 families) in the western plain region. The biodiversity of medicinal plants in Jilin province was high and presented a trend of high in the east and low in the west. The medicinal plant resources were mainly concentrated in the eastern mountainous region, and the number of medicinal plant groups had significant diffe-rences between regions, following the trend of western region &gt; central region &gt; eastern region. The species richness was in the order of eastern region &gt; western region &gt; central region. The species diversity structure in the central region was similar to that in the eastern and western regions, while it was significantly different between the western and eastern regions. Compared with the third national survey of traditional Chinese medicine resources, the fourth survey showed an increase of 1 417 species, a decrease of 580 species, and 824 common species, indicating significant changes in the biodiversity of medicinal plants in Jilin province. The reasons for these changes need to be further explored. This article elucidates the background and biodiversity changes of medicinal plant resources in Jilin province, laying a foundation for the protection, utilization, and industrial development of traditional Chinese medicine resources in Jilin province."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Han-Ning", "Initials": "HN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tonghua Normal University Tonghua 134002, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jun-Lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Da-Cheng", "Initials": "DC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jia-Wen", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Xing", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Ming-Xuan", "Initials": "MX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "the Third Affiliated Hospital of Changchun University of Chinese Medicine Changchun 130021, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yu-Cui", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Jing-Lei", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodiversity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39099347", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20240414.102"]}}]}
