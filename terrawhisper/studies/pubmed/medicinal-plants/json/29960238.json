Each plant was successively extracted by n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol to obtain a total of 75 extracts. The inhibiting effect of extracts was measured by a colorimetric assay in 96-well microplates. The n-hexane extract of Prangos ferulacea showed the highest AChE inhibitory activity with 75.6% inhibition at a concentration of 50\u202f\u03bcg/mL. The chemical composition of this extract was investigated in detail based on a combination of HPLC/bioassay-guided fractionation and molecular networking techniques. The results led to the identification of seventeen compounds, one of them was a fatty acid derivative, two compounds had flavonoid structure and others were furanocoumarin type compounds. In vitro analysis showed that the subfraction F<sub>10f</sub> was the most potent inhibitor against the activity of AChE with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 25.2\u202f\u03bcg/mL and good docking scores of its constituents confirming its high activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
