These proteins are involved in the responses to different abiotic stress conditions and have highly conserved gene sequences. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of Fritillaria cirrhosa in response to high-temperature stress. Here, 26 HSP70s, FcHSP70-1 to FcHSP70-26, were identified from the transcriptome data of root, bulb, stem, leaf, and fruit samples of F. cirrhosa. The proteins encoded by FcHSP70s had the lengths ranging from 560 aa to 944 aa, with the molecular weight of 61.64-100.01 kDa and the theoretical isoelectric point between 5.00 and 6.59. The secondary structural elements of HSP70s were mainly random coils and \u03b1-helixes. Subcellular localization prediction revealed that FcHSP70s were distributed in mitochondria, chloroplasts, nuclei, endoplasmic reticulum, and cytoplasm. The phylogenetic tree showed that 7 members of the HSP70 family belonged to the Dnak subfamily and 19 members belonged to the HSP110/SSE subfamily. In addition, the qRT-PCR results showed that the expression of FcHSP70-5, FcHSP70-8, FcHSP70-17, FcHSP70-18, and FcHSP70-23 in F. cirrhosa was significantly up-regulated at 35 \u2103, which indicated that these genes might play a role in the response to high temperature stress. In addition, compared with other tissues, stems and leaves were sensitive to high temperature stress, with the expression of 18 genes up-regulated by 18.18 and 8.03 folds on average, respectively. These findings provide valuable information about the molecular mechanism of HSP70s of F. cirrhosa in response to high temperature stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
