Previous studies showed that ginger and dexmedmoidine can reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting. Therefore, the effectiveness of ginger was compared with dexmedmoidine for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting.", "This randomized clinical trial study was performed on 92 patients who had abdominal hysterectomy in a double-blind evaluation. In this study, 92 patients were randomly divided into two equal groups of dexmedmotidine and ginger. In the ginger group, 1 gr of ginger was given orally before and after the anesthesia and in the second group, 25 mg of dexmedmotidine was slowly injected before surgery. Finally, after the operation, the questionnaire was completed for patients and the data obtained from the questionnaires were analyzed by SPSS19 software.", "There was a significant difference between the two groups of dexmodetomidine and ginger in terms of scorpion vomiting in recovery and 2 hours after operation. Vomiting scores were significantly lower in the ginger group than dexmodetomidine group (P = .02 and P = .03). However, no significant difference was defined between the two groups 4 hours after operation, and the scoring was reported to be zero in both groups. Moreover, a decreased level of nausea was observed in the ginger group as compared to the of dexmedetomidine group.", "Both dexmedmotidine and ginger are effective in reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting. But the effect of ginger is greater than that of dexmodetomidine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kamali", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Beigi", "ForeName": "Shabnam", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shokrpour", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pazuki", "ForeName": "Shirin", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Altern Ther Health Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9502013", "ISSNLinking": "1078-6791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypnotics and Sedatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "67VB76HONO", "NameOfSubstance": "Dexmedetomidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dexmedetomidine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zingiber officinale"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Hypnotics and Sedatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hysterectomy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31634871", "AT5918"]}}]}
