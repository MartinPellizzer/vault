At both temperatures, refrigeration was compared with an ice/seawater cooling system. At 5 degrees C, the effect of added 0.2% acetic acid was also tested. Electronic nose measurements were compared to measurements of total volatile bases (TVB), gas chromatography of volatile compounds, and sensory analysis. TVB analysis indicated less spoilage in seawater/ice systems than in refrigeration, but the other measurements indicated more spoilage in the seawater system compared to refrigeration. The possibility of using only a few sensors in the electronic nose to predict TVB was studied using partial least squares regression and a saturated generalized linear model. The results reported herein indicate that rapid electronic nose measurements, which require no sample preparation, can be used to predict the TVB value of the raw material stored under different conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Icelandic Fisheries Laboratories, Reykjav\u00edk."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olafsd\u00f3ttir", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "H\u00f6gnad\u00f3ttir", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martinsd\u00f3ttir", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electronics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fish Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10888549", "10.1021/jf990322q", "jf990322q"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
