The control and treatment of viral diseases are very important due to the evolution of viruses and the emergence of new viruses compared to other pathogens such as fungi and bacteria. <i>Astragalus membranaceus</i> (AM) is a significant medicinal plant. The potential use of this plant and its chemical components in the treatment of inflammatory illnesses and viral diseases has been vigorously researched recently.<i> Astragalus</i> polysaccharides (APS) make up the majority of AM's ingredients. The main mechanisms of the antiviral effect of APS have been investigated in some studies. The results of these studies show that APS can exert its antiviral effect by enhancing type I IFN signaling, inhibiting the expression of Bax and Caspase-3 proteins in the apoptosis pathway, and other antiviral mechanisms such as anti-inflammatory activities. The most well-known inflammatory products of APS's antiviral effects are B-cell proliferation, antibody products, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), and IL(s). Although it has a known effectiveness, there are some limitations to this substance's use as medicine. The use of nanotechnology is removing these limitations and its ability to be used as an anti-virus agent. The purpose of this review is to emphasize the role of AM, especially APS, in controlling inflammatory pathways in the treatment of viral infections. With the emergence of these herbal medications, a new path has been opened in the control and treatment of viral infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Virology Department, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Policy Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghabeshi", "ForeName": "Soad", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Virology, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mousavizadeh", "ForeName": "Leila", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Plants Research Center, Basic Health Sciences Institute, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghasemi", "ForeName": "Sorayya", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Antiinflamm Antiallergy Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101462262", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5230"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Astragalus propinquus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38115620", "10.2174/0118715230280333231207114927", "AIAAMC-EPUB-136737"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
