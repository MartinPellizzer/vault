Models of hemorrhagic shock for 60 minutes and reperfusion for 90 minutes were created. The animals were administrated 3 mL therapeutic solution before reperfusion. At the end of study, intestinal pathology was observed, and the concentration of lactic acid (LD), nitric oxide (NO), endothelin (ET) of intestinal mucosa were detected.", "The intestinal pathology showed that intestinal mucosa epithelial cells damage in model group was severe, in low dosage group was medium, in high dosage group was slight, and no obvious damage was found in normal group. The concentration of LD and NO of small intestine mucous membrane in model group and low dosage group were significantly higher than those in high dosage group and normal group (P < 0.05), but there were no significant differences between high dosage group and normal group (P > 0.05). The concentration of ET of small intestine mucous membrane in model group was the highest of the four groups (P < 0.05).
