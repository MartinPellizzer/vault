The results obtained indicated the heterogeneity of legumin molecular species. The nature of the heterogeneity was common to all cultivars examined from the standpoint of the molecular sizes of the subunits. Four groups of molecular species with molecular weights of 320 000, 350 000, 380 000 and 400 000 were detected by gradient gel electrophoresis. The smallest molecular species was composed of only three kinds of subunit, with molecular weights of 20 500, 23 000 and 36 000, and the largest one was composed of five kinds of subunit with molecular weights of 19 000, 23 000, 36 000, 49 000 and 51 000. All molecular species were composed of intermediary subunits which consisted of acidic and basic subunits. The intermediary subunits with molecular weights of 61 700, 59 800 and 48 000 are composed of the acidic subunits with molecular weights of 51 000, 49 000 and 36 000 and the basic subunits with molecular weights of 19 000, 19 000 and 23 000 or 20 500, respectively. The possible molecular species constructed from the subunit groups classified according to their sizes were presented."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Utsumi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mori", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biochim Biophys Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0217513", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60-24-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercaptoethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mercaptoethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "2", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7353037", "10.1016/0005-2795(80)90170-1", "0005-2795(80)90170-1"]}}]}
