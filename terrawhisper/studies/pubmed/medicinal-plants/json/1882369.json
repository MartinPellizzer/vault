Processing standards to attain an optimum nutritional value will then have to be based on the nutritional evaluation of legume and oil seeds. Priorities in studying the effects of processing these raw materials are to attain an optimum degree of nutritional value of protein rather than the reduction of ANFs. Obviously, reduction of proteinaceous ANFs can be accomplished by thermal methods of treatment. Residual activities of the ANFs alone, however, do not predict the quality of protein in vivo, in every case. Other factors (storage protein, carbohydrates) may also be important in addition to ANFs. This means that elimination of ANFs alone however, cannot always ensure a sufficient increase in digestibility as determined in experimental studies in animals. By correlating the results of technological experiments with those of trials in animals, optimum information may be gathered in attempting to attain an optimum nutritional value by technological methods of treatment. This will contribute to a more correct and accurate understanding of the effects of animal feed technology on the performance of animals and the consequences for the excretion of undigested nutrients in the environment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Vakgroep Veevoeding, Landbouwuniversiteit, Wageningen."}], "LastName": "van der Poel", "ForeName": "A F", "Initials": "AF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Negatieve effecten van antinutritionele factoren in diervoeders op de stikstofbelasting van het milieu en mogelijkheden tot reductie."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Tijdschr Diergeneeskd", "NlmUniqueID": "0031550", "ISSNLinking": "0040-7453"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1882369"]}}]}
