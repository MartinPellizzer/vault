The practitioners of traditional medicine are specialists recognized by the culture as having spiritual power to promote health. These individuals have been interviewed in order to determine which plants are presently in use. The healers interviewed represent a disappearing tradition which is not being passed on to the next generation. An effort has been made to record all of the plants used by all of the healers which remain in the Rotuman culture (on the island).
