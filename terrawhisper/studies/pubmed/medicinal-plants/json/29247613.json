However, the precise mechanisms are unclear. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms of LA against HepG2 cells. LA anti-tumor activity was assessed with the CCK-8, Ki-67, and immunofluorescence staining. Cells apoptotic ratio was evaluated by Annexin V/PI double-staining assay. A proteomic approach was used to identify differentially expressed proteins after LA treatment. JC-1 staining was carried out to detect the mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m), and the Western blot analysis was used to analyse the apoptosis-associated proteins. Our results suggested that LA significantly suppressed the viability of HepG2 cells. The CCK-8 and Ki-67 expression indicated dose-dependent decreases in cell proliferation. Flow cytometry analysis showed that LA exhibited a apoptosis-inducing effect. The proteomic study observed the presence of apoptosis-associated proteins and mitochondrial dysfunction in HepG2 cells after LA-treatment. Further analysis showed that LA could trigger the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway, based on a decrease in \u0394\u03a8m; deliver of cytochrome c; activation of caspase-9/-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; and decrease of the proportion of Bcl-2/Bax. Collectively, our studies found that LA exhibits significant cytotoxic effects by inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, possibly via activation of the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
