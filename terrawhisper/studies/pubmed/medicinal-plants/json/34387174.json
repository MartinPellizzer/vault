Flavonoids are naturally occurring phytochemicals produced in plants through metabolisms, and they have anti-hyperlipidemia, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic activity. Flavonoids have been identified in fruits, nuts, vegetables, seeds, stems, flowers, and tea. Kaempferol is a natural flavonoidal compound present in edible plants such as apples, broccoli, strawberries, beans, grapefruit, propolis, and medicinal plants such as Aloe vera, Ginkgo biloba, Rosmarinus officinalis, Crocus sativus L., Hypericum perforatum L. Kaempferol have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, proapoptotic, cardio-protective and anti-cancer activities.", "Glycosides of kaempferol such as kaempferitrin, also called kaempferol 3,7-dirhamnoside are known to be more abundant than their flavonoid monomers in plants. Various literature databases have been searched to collect all the scientific information of kaempferitrin in the present investigation and analyzed in order to know the therapeutic benefit and biological potential of kaempferitrin. Moreover, all the information has been presented here in two broad sections, i.e., pharmacological and analytical.", "From the analysis of all the collected and presented information, it was found that kaempferitrin has potent insulin-mimetic potential and could be used for the treatment of diabetes and related complications. However, it has also shown anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-convulsant, anti-osteoporotic, anti-depressant, anthelmintic, immunostimulatory, and natriuretic properties and inhibits cell proliferation and apoptosis. Kaempferitrin also improves the meat quality of broiler chickens.", "The presented information in this work will be valuable to justify the biological importance and therapeutic potential of kaempferitrin in the scientific field."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences Naini, Prayagraj, 211007, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Dinesh Kumar", "Initials": "DK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Cardiovasc Hematol Disord Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "101269160", "ISSNLinking": "1871-529X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Kaempferols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VPV01U3R59", "NameOfSubstance": "lespenefril"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Kaempferols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "41"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34387174", "10.2174/1871529X21666210812111931", "CHDDT-EPUB-117304"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
