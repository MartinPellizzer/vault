An accumulation of mitochondria was found in freshly invaded host cells, containing only a few symbiosomes (SBs) that are released from highly branched intracellular ramification of the infection threads. Moreover, besides the fusion between the SB membrane with host secretory vesicles, we observe also a great number of fusions between the outer leaflets of adjoining SB membranes, thus resulting in structures that resemble the tight junction network (zona occludens with a five-layered structure) of epithelian cells. This process was found to be induced strongly and earlier both in the invaded host cells of ineffective nodules (elicited by Fix- mutant strains of R. etli) and in the older (senescence) invaded cells of effective nodules, whereas bacteroid division is seldom if ever observed. Our observations strongly suggest that multiple-occupancy SBs also arise by fusion of single-occupancy SBs and the physiological consequence of this process is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Institute of Genetics and Biophysics, CNR, Naples, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cermola", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fedorova", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tat\u00e9", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Riccio", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Favre", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Patriarca", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Plant Microbe Interact", "NlmUniqueID": "9107902", "ISSNLinking": "0894-0282"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.18.6.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "microbiology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Symbiosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10875334", "10.1094/MPMI.2000.13.7.733"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
