In Cameroon, this infection shows a great variability in prevalence in the country and even within different population groups. However, the prevalence of HBV in the southwestern region is not yet known.", "This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B, its associated factors, and the patient's knowledge about the infection at the Buea Regional Hospital.", "We conducted a hospital-based cross-sectional study from March 29th to June 30th, 2021 involving participants of both sexes with ages ranging from 13 to 60+. A random sampling method was used to obtain a sample size of 113 participants as calculated using Lorentz's formula. The study questionnaires were administered to participants and their blood samples were collected by venous puncture. The blood samples were collected in non-hepainized test tube at the collection units of the Hospital. Diaspot one-step Hepatitis B Surface Antigen test strips with 99% sensitivity and 97% specificity were used to determine the status of the participants. The data were analysed using SPSS 25.0. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were used to obtain associated factors. The level of significance was set at p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05.", "A total of 125 participants were recruited. However, only 119 provided complete data (questionnaire and blood samples). A proportion 61 (51.3%) of the participants were females in the 20-29-year age group. The prevalence of hepatitis was 8.4%. Fifty-three percent (64) of the participants had adequate knowledge of Hepatitis B. Having had more than one sexual partner in the last six months and having visited a dentist in the past was significantly associated with Hepatitis B positive status (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05).", "The prevalence of Hepatitis B in the Buea Regional Hospital is 8.4% and 53.8% of the participants had adequate knowledge of the infection.
