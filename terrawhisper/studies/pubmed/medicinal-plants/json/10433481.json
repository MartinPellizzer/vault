Since the hypertension in this model depends largely on the increasing concentrations of vasopressor agents (prostaglandins and angiotensin II) there is a strong indication that reducing these factors could contribute in controlling the pathological rise in blood pressure. In this study, single or multiple doses of 0.5 ml of aqueous extract of garlic were given orally to 2K-1C rats. The data shows that the single dose of garlic used had a maximum antihypertensive effect 2-6 h after administration. The residual effect of this single dose continued for up to 24 h. The multiple dose of garlic appeared to be effective in restraining the expected rise in blood pressure that normally occurs in 2K-1C rats. Switching multiple-dose treatments halfway through the experiment further strengthened the findings. The study suggests that garlic does have an effective antihypertensive ability, and may be used as a supplementary and natural remedy in cases of unilateral renovascular hypertension."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Kuwait, Safat."}], "LastName": "Al-Qattan", "ForeName": "K K", "Initials": "KK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alnaqeeb", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension, Renovascular"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10433481", "10.1016/s0378-8741(98)00173-1", "S0378-8741(98)00173-1"]}}]}
