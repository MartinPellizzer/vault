Thus it seems that such commercial RIA-kits can reach at best a CV within-assay of 5% and a similar variation between assays. Without a good control of the performance, the variation can increase 5-6 times. We found that the precision of digoxin RIA as performed at 27 Swedish laboratories using 10 different methods varied from 0.05 to 0.61 nmol/L in between-assay SD for a pool of 2.60 nmol/L. Up to 100% deviations between the highest and lowest reported concentration of a spiked plasma pool may occasionally occur. Such deviations mostly depend on the laboratory, but there are contributions from the kit and effects of the matrix as well. Matrix effects were observed in plasma samples from patients with uremia, acute myocardial infarction and treated with spironolactone to which digoxin was added to a concentration of 2.50 nmol/L. We found 10% underestimation by one method, 10% overestimation by two methods and 5% overestimation by a fourth method, respectively, with the above described samples. For a good judgement of a found plasma concentration value, calculation of a confidence interval is useful. This can be done by computer fitting of the standard curve after duplicate runs of standards and samples in random order. One source of error in RIA appears to be the use of inaccurate standards. We found that standards provided with different RIA-kits for digoxin varied up to 30%. Various physicochemical properties of cardiac glycosides, which could influence the assays were studied. Both digitoxin and digoxin are sparsely soluble in water (5.1 and 36 mumol/L, respectively). Methanol is a much better solvent, which dissolves 6.9 mmol/L of digoxin and 20-24 mmol/L of digitoxin. Chloroform is a good solvent for digitoxin (29-34 mmol/L) but not for digoxin (0.42 mmol/L). Partition of cardenolides between chloroform and water reflected their lipophilic or hydrophilic character. Thus, digitoxin had a high affinity to the organic phase (distribution constant KD = 10(3.65)), while the hydrophilic deslanoside was preferentially found in the aqueous phase (KD = 10(-3.08). Interestingly, the sugar moiety digitoxose in the digoxin molecule turned out to be a substituent that increased lipophilicity. Adsorption of cardiac glycosides occurs to plastics and glass from aqueous solutions. To overcome losses at low concentrations, the solutions must contain plasma, albumin, alcohol or similar solubility-increasing ingredients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Molin", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Toxicol (Copenh)", "NlmUniqueID": "0370572", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6683"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Digitalis Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reagent Kits, Diagnostic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "73K4184T59", "NameOfSubstance": "Digoxin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Digoxin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Radioimmunoassay"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Reagent Kits, Diagnostic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research Design"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3739734"]}}]}
