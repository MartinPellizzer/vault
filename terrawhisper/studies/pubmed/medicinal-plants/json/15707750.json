Ethanolic extract, hexane and ethyl acetate fractions of Mikania laevigata and Mikania glomerata were chemically identified by chromatographic methods and tested on mutans streptococci from culture collection and clinical isolates. Twenty-two compounds were identified in both Mikania extracts, including coumarin, 1-octadecene, and diterpenic, cupressenic and kaurenoic acids. Antimicrobial activity was assessed by determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and inhibition of cell adherence to a glass surface. Hexane fraction from both plant extracts was the most effective in inhibiting the growth of the bacterial strains tested (MIC values between 12.5 microg/ml and 400 microg/ml, and MBC values between 25 microg/ml and 400 microg/ml). In addition, sub-MIC levels of the crude extracts and their hexane fractions significantly inhibited the adherence of the microorganisms to a glass surface. The data indicate that the biologically active compounds are present mostly in the hexane fraction of both Mikania species, which showed remarkable inhibitory activities against mutans streptococci. Mikania genus plant is a promising source for novel antimicrobial agents against oral pathogens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Dentistry of Piracicaba, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Piracicaba SP, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yatsuda", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosalen", "ForeName": "P L", "Initials": "PL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cury", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murata", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rehder", "ForeName": "V L G", "Initials": "VL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Melo", "ForeName": "L V", "Initials": "LV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koo", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mikania"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Streptococcus mutans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15707750", "10.1016/j.jep.2004.09.042", "S0378-8741(04)00496-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
