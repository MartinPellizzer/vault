However, their specific impact on both the yield and quality of Paris polyphylla (P. polyphylla), along with the underlying mechanisms, remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the distinct effects of organic fertiliser (at concentrations of 5% and 10%) and biochar application (at levels of 2% and 4%) on P. polyphylla saponin content. This content is intricately regulated by available soil nutrients, enzyme activities, and microbial community compositions and activities. Our results clearly demonstrated a significant increase in the saponin content, including total saponin, polyphyllin I (PPI), polyphyllin II (PPII), polyphyllin VI (PPVI), and polyphyllin VII (PPVII), in P. polyphylla following the application of both biochar and organic fertiliser. Moreover, in comparison to the control group, the addition of biochar and organic fertiliser led to a considerable rise in the activity of glycosyltransferase enzyme (GTS) and cycloartenol synthase (CAS) in P. polyphylla. Additionally, it increased soil available potassium (AK) and soil organic matter (SOM) concentration, along with the activity of urease, acid phosphatase, and catalase, although biochar amendment resulted in a decrease in nitrate nitrogen (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N) concentration. Crucially, our findings revealed a positive correlation between total saponin content and the activity of CAS in P. polyphylla, soil AK, SOM concentration, and the activities of urease, acid phosphatase, and catalase. Conversely, there was a negative correlation with NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N content. Furthermore, the application of organic fertiliser and biochar significantly influenced microbial community structures and specific microbial taxa. Notably, total saponin content exhibited a positive relationship with the relative abundances of Dehalococcoidia, Saccharomycetes, and Agaricomycetes taxa while showing a negative correlation with the abundance of Verrucomicrobiae. In conclusion, the observed increase in saponin content can be attributed to the modulation of specific microbial taxa in soils, as well as alterations in soil nutrients and enzyme activities resulting from the application of biochar and organic fertiliser. This study identifies a potential mechanism for enhancing saponin content in the artificial cultivation of P. polyphylla."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
