However, extraction from plants is time-consuming, environmentally unfriendly, and insufficient. Although microbial synthesis of flavonoids has been extensively reported, synthesis of downstream modified 4'-deoxyflavones has not, and their yields are extremely low. Here, we reassembled the <i>S. baicalensis</i> 4'-deoxyflavone biosynthetic pathway in a Crabtree-negative yeast, <i>Pichia pastoris</i>, with activity analysis and combinatorial expression of eight biosynthetic genes, allowing production of 4'-deoxyflavones like baicalein, oroxylin A, wogonin, norwogonin, 6-methoxywogonin, and the novel 6-methoxynorwogonin. <i>De novo</i> baicalein synthesis was then achieved by complete pathway assembly. Toxic intermediates highly impaired the cell production capacity; hence, we alleviated cinnamic acid growth inhibition by culturing the cells at near-neutral pH and using alcoholic carbon sources. To achieve pathway balance and improve baicalein and oroxylin A synthesis, we further divided the pathway into five modules. A series of ethanol-induced and constitutive transcriptional amplification devices were constructed to adapt to the modules. This fine-tuning pathway control considerably reduced byproduct and intermediate accumulation and achieved high-level <i>de novo</i> baicalein (401.9 mg/L with a total increase of 1182-fold, the highest titer reported) and oroxylin A (339.5 mg/L, for the first time) production from ethanol. This study provides new strategies for the microbial synthesis of 4'-deoxyflavones and other flavonoids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China."}], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Zhilan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jiahui", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xinjie", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Yijia", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Yanna", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0596-5579"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Resources, Shanghai Chenshan Botanical Garden, Shanghai Chenshan Plant Science Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201602, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6225-8515"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of Optogenetic Techniques for Cell Metabolism, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Menghao", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Synth Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101575075", "ISSNLinking": "2161-5063"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "49QAH60606", "NameOfSubstance": "baicalein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "53K24Z586G", "NameOfSubstance": "5,7-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-2-phenylchromen-4-one"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavanones"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35389625", "10.1021/acssynbio.2c00026"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
