The appearance of these structures is temporally correlated with the disappearance of single-stranded reticulum and the onset of seed dehydration. These aggregates can be demonstrated also in the dry, mature seed and during the first few hours after imbibition with water; they disappear however during germination. In germinated root tips reformation of the aggregates can be induced by severe water stress. It is concluded that the observed membrane aggregates represent a storage form of rough endoplasmic reticulum during periods of low protoplasmic hydration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bergfeld", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schopfer", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Cell Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "7906240", "ISSNLinking": "0171-9335"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Endoplasmic Reticulum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Mustard Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Development"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6734628"]}}]}
