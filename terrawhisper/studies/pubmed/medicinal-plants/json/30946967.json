In Persian ethnomedicine, several formulations of sugarcane extracts including faniz, shekar-e- sorkh and black strap molasses have been used to treat pediatric constipation.", "To evaluate efficacy and safety of oral intake of black strap molasses syrup (BSM) on FC in children.", "A randomized controlled double blinded trial was performed on children aged 4-12 years diagnosed with FC according to ROMIII Constipation Measurement Questionnaire. Ninety-two patients were randomly divided in two groups of BSM or PEG syrups (40%) with a dose of 1\u202fmL/kg body weight/day for 1 month. Symptoms were evaluated every two weeks. Possible serological side-effects and changes in children's body weight were investigated. BSM syrup constituents were determined by pharmacognostic methods.", "Treatment was successful with both interventions with no significant difference between the groups. Defecation per week was significantly improved in both groups. Symptoms including volitional stool retention, large diameter stool, painful or hard stool and large fecal mass in the rectum decreased significantly two and four weeks after intervention (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). There was no significant difference between groups except for the rate of large diameter stool. No side -effects were observed. The BSM naturally contained polyphenols (960\u202f\u03bcg/mL), potassium (12430\u202f\u03bcg/mL), iron (80\u202f\u03bcg/mL) and calcium (3320\u202f\u03bcg/mL).", "BSM and PEG syrups had similar efficacy on FC.
