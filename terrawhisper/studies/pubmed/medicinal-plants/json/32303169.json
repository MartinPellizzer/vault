Maintaining healthy skin is important for a healthy body. Medicinal plants have long provided reliable therapy in the treatment of skin diseases in humans through a diverse range of bioactive molecules. Skin diseases may have a various basis, or may be genetically determined; together, they constitute approximately 34% of all occupational diseases encountered in people of all ages. Of these, melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms, with very poor prognosis for patients if it is diagnosed too late. This review of the literature over the past five years examines the role and utilities of plant extracts in treating various skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, acne or melanoma with various potential mechanisms of action."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Pharmaceutical Botany, Medical University of Lodz, Poland."}], "LastName": "Sitarek", "ForeName": "Przemys\u0142aw", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Genetics, University of Lodz, S.
