Activation of TLRs results in the production of cytokines, chemokines and interferons along with activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, resulting in inflammatory perturbations. TLR4 signaling pathway is the most extensively studied of TLRs. TLR4 is expressed on renal microvascular endothelial and tubular epithelial cells. So, targeting TLR4 modulation could be a therapeutic approach to attenuate kidney diseases that are underlined by inflammatory cascade. Medicinal plants with anti-inflammatory activities display valuable effects and are employed as alternative sources to alleviate renal disease linked with inflammation. Flavonoids and other phytochemicals derived from traditional medicines possess promising pharmacological activities owing to their relatively cheap and high safety profile. Our review focuses on the potent anti-inflammatory activities of twenty phytochemicals to verify if their potential promising renoprotective effects are related to suppression of TLR4 signaling in different renal diseases, including sepsis-induced acute kidney injury, renal fibrosis, chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity, diabetic nephropathy and renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. Additionally, molecular docking simulations were employed to explore the potential binding affinity of these phytochemicals to TLR4 as a strategy to attenuate renal diseases associated with activated TLR4 signaling."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, United Kingdom."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physiology Division, Zoology Department, Faculty of Science, Beni-Suef University, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mahmoud", "ForeName": "Ayman M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry Laboratory, Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Assiut University, Asyut, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Sayed", "ForeName": "Ahmed M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Ajman University, United Arab Emirates."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Medical and Bio-Allied Health Sciences Research, Ajman University, United Arab Emirates."}], "LastName": "Ahmeda", "ForeName": "Ahmed F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Beni-Suef University, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abd-Alhameed", "ForeName": "Esraa K", "Initials": "EK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Assiut University , Asyut, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Salem", "ForeName": "Shimaa H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, College of Science, Princess Nourah, Bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alruhaimi", "ForeName": "Reem S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy & Medical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford, Bradford, UK."}], "LastName": "Shukur", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University-Assiut Branch, Asyut, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hassanein", "ForeName": "Emad H M", "Initials": "EHM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Comb Chem High Throughput Screen", "NlmUniqueID": "9810948", "ISSNLinking": "1386-2073"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toll-Like Receptor 4"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "TLR4 protein, human"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Toll-Like Receptor 4"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Nephropathies"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36650620", "10.2174/1386207326666230116124532", "CCHTS-EPUB-128866"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
