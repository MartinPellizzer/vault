For treating the intermittent claudication many drugs are used, which may give rise to therapeutical side effects. In 50 patients with diagnosed arteriosclerosis affecting the lower extremities in II stage according to Fontain, a vegetable preparation PADMA-28 was applied for 16 weeks. A marked, statistically significant elongation of the claudication distance was achieved. That was measured, under standardized condition, on an ergometer-treadmill. Moreover, there was also a decrease in the index of blood platelets aggregation, a drop in the level of cholesterol, triglycerides, total lipids, beta lipoproteins, and an increase in ++alpha lipoproteins. Also 50 patients were receiving placebo for 16 weeks, but no positive results were observed in comparison with preparation PADMA-28. The studies were carried out by the method of double blind test, the latter was accomplished by randomized method. Observation, the performed biochemical examinations did not reveal any undesirable effect. Drug tolerance was excellent. The positive influence of the drug may result from summed action of components contained in the preparation namely: bioflavonoides, salicylates, valepotriates, tannins, phenol acids, ethereal oils and esters of acids. PADMA-28 may be a useful adjuvant to therapeutic methods with regard to chronic ischemia of the lower extremities in II stage, according to Fontain."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oddzia\u0142u Klinicznego Chor\u00f3b Zawodowych Instytutu Farmakologii i Toksykologii Pomorskiej Akademii Medycznej."}], "LastName": "Smulski", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"], "VernacularTitle": "Leczenie przewlek\u0142ego niedokrwienia ko\u0144czyn dolnych z\u0142ozonym preparatem zio\u0142owym."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Ann Acad Med Stetin", "NlmUniqueID": "7506854", "ISSNLinking": "1427-440X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "122879-13-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Padma 28"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood", "complications"], "DescriptorName": "Arteriosclerosis Obliterans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "complications"], "DescriptorName": "Intermittent Claudication"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood supply"], "DescriptorName": "Leg"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1816752"]}}]}
