While drugs that target several pathways underlying AD have been proposed, effective treatments remain to be discovered. BACE1, an enzyme associated with AD progression, is a promising target for developing anti-Alzheimer drugs. To find novel multifunctional anti-Alzheimer agents, we designed and synthesized a series of new substituted benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl-N-cyclohexylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-amine. The in vitro screening results revealed that most of the compounds exhibited moderate to potent BACE1 and BuChE inhibitory and antioxidant activities. Compounds 7f and 7g, bearing dichloro (2,3-Cl<sub>2</sub> and 3,4-Cl<sub>2</sub>) moieties on the benzyl pendant were selected as the most active compounds in our BACE1 inhibitory assay with respective IC<sub>50</sub> values of about 12 and 8.9\u00a0\u03bcM. In addition, compounds 7g and 7h (4-bromo derivative) showed the highest BuChE inhibitory activity with IC<sub>50</sub> of 3.2 and 2.5\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively. Compound 7g also possessed antioxidant activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 10.2\u00a0\u03bcM and metal chelation potential. Moreover, docking studies were performed to investigate the possible mechanism of inhibition. Taken together, we demonstrate that N-cyclohexylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine containing triazole motif derivatives deserve further investigation for anti-Alzheimer drug development."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
