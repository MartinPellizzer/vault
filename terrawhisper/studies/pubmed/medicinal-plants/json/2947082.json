Following oral administration, expired 14C-CO2 represented 16% of the administered dose excreted within the first 3 hours post-dose out of a total of 38% after 72 hours. An additional 21% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine. The absorption of the radiolabelled Ginkgo biloba extract was at least 60%. The pharmacokinetics of the drug, based on blood specific activity data versus time course, were characteristic of a two-compartment model with an apparent first order phase and a biological half-life of approximatively 4.5 h. During the first 3 hours, radioactivity was primarily associated with the plasma, but through a gradual uptake after 48 h. The specific activity in erythrocytes matched that of plasma. A site of absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract is suspected since specific activity in blood peaked after 1.5 hours. Glandular and neuronal tissues and eyes showed a high affinity for the labelled substance. These results provide the first tentative link between the therapeutic effectiveness of Ginkgo biloba extract and the biological fate of some of its constituents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Moreau", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Eck", "ForeName": "C R", "Initials": "CR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "McCabe", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Skinner", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Absorption, distribution et \u00e9limination de l'extrait marqu\u00e9 de feuilles de Ginkgo biloba chez le rat."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Presse Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8302490", "ISSNLinking": "0755-4982"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "9", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2947082"]}}]}
