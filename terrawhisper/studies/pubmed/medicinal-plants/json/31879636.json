Furthermore, Candida albicans is the most common VVC agents followed by, non-albicans Candida species. Nowadays, extensive studies are being conducted on alternative therapies and the use of herbal medicines.", "The present study was conducted to compare the effect of curcumin and clotrimazole vaginal cream in the treatment of VVC.", "The present randomized controlled trial study was performed on 94 women passing through their productive age after their being diagnosed with VVC. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups, with one receiving curcumin-based vaginal 10% cream and the other receiving clotrimazole vaginal 1% cream. The treatment period was 1 week and a full 5 g applicator was used every night. Required follow-up was implemented 4-7 days after the end of treatment.", "The results showed no significant differences between the two groups in terms of vaginal discharge, itching, vulvovaginal irritation, and vulvovaginal erythema (<i>P</i> > 0.05); however, the number of negative cultures in the group receiving curcumin was significantly lower in comparison with the other group, which received clotrimazole (<i>P</i> = 0.002).", "It seems that although curcumin could be effective in the treatment of clinical symptoms of VVC, it, quite similar to clotrimazole vaginal cream, did not affect vaginal culture."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2019 Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery, Reproductive Health Promotion Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abouali", "ForeName": "Nilufar", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moghimipour", "ForeName": "Eskandar", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Mycology, School of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahmoudabadi", "ForeName": "Ali Zarei", "Initials": "AZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy, Marine Pharmaceutical Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Namjouyan", "ForeName": "Foroogh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery, Reproductive Health Promotion Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbaspoor", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Family Med Prim Care", "NlmUniqueID": "101610082", "ISSNLinking": "2249-4863"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no financial interests related to the material in the manuscript."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Workowski KA, Bolan GA.
