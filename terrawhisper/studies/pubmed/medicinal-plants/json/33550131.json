Wats) is an aromatic grass with great industrial potential. It is cultivated for its essential oil (EO) which has great economical value due to its numerous medicinal, cosmetic and culinary applications. The present study was conducted on silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) application to lemongrass with the objective of overall agronomic enhancements. Graded concentrations (50-200\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) of SiNPs were exogenously applied to lemongrass leaves. The physiological and biochemical analyses revealed that 150\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> SiNPs is the optimum concentration for lemongrass plants. This concentration triggered photosynthetic variables, gas exchange modules and activities of enzymes involved in EO (geraniol dehydrogenase) and nitrogen (nitrate reductase) metabolism as well as in the antioxidant system (catalase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase). These SiNPs-induced metabolic changes altogether significantly (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) enhanced overall plant growth and yield. Moreover, SiNPs treatments assisted in palliating lipid peroxidation and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content in lemongrass leaves which added further advantage to plant metabolism. Overall, data indicates SiNPs elicit beneficial effects on lemongrass growth and yield through inducing various physiological and biochemical responses. This renders high possibility that similar objectives could be achieved with SiNPs biotechnological application on further related agronomic crops as well as in diverse industries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
