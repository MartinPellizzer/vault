Based on selected articles, this review deals with the potential antiviral and virucidal activities of essential oils and essential oil compounds together with their mechanism of action as well as <i>in silico</i> studies involving viral and host cell-specific target molecules that are indispensable for virus cell adsorption, penetration, and replication. The reported <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies highlight the baseline data about the latest findings of essential oils and essential oil compounds antiviral and virucidal effects on enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, taking into account available biochemical and molecular biological tests. The results of many <i>in vitro</i> studies revealed that several essential oils and essential oil compounds from different medicinal and aromatic plants are potent antiviral and virucidal agents that inhibit viral progeny by blocking different steps of the viral infection/replication cycle of DNA and RNA viruses in various host cell lines. Studies in mice infected with viruses causing respiratory diseases showed that different essential oils and essential oil compounds were able to prolong the life of infected animals, reduce virus titers in brain and lung tissues, and significantly inhibit the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In addition, some <i>in vitro</i> studies on hydrophilic nano-delivery systems encapsulating essential oils/essential oil compounds exhibited a promising way to improve the chemical stability and enhance the water solubility, bioavailabilty, and antiviral efficacy of essential oils and essential oil compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Thieme.
