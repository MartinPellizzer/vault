Apigenin was freely soluble in dimethylsulfoxide (> 100 mg/mL), but it had low solubility (0.00135-1.63 mg/mL) in all the other solvents and surfactants tested, especially in highly hydrophilic or nonpolar solvents. The partition coefficient (log K) calculated from the solubility ratio of apigenin in n-octanol and water was 2.87. Apigenin strongly absorbed UV light, with three maximum absorption wavelengths at 212, 269, and 337 nm (epsilon = 29,800, 19,020, and 18,930 M-1 cm-1, respectively). Using quercetin as the internal standard, a reversed-phase HPLC method was developed to quantitatively analyze apigenin in epidermal cells obtained from SENCAR mice. Apigenin was labeled at position 6, 8, 3', and 5' with tritium by a platinum-catalyzed proton-tritium exchange as confirmed indirectly by 1H NMR analysis of the deuterated apigenin. The tritium label was stable in aqueous environments, especially under acidic and neutral conditions, so [G-3H]apigenin was considered suitable for subsequent absorption and metabolic studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198, USA."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Robinson", "ForeName": "D H", "Initials": "DH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Birt", "ForeName": "D F", "Initials": "DF"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P30 CA 36727", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "2985195R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3549"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "10028-17-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Tritium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chamomile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tritium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9188055", "10.1021/js960383s", "S0022-3549(15)50323-7"]}}]}
