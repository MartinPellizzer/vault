Given its ecological significance and mounting pressures from agricultural activities such as tea growing, continuous monitoring of the levels of chemical toxins like pesticides in the park and surrounding areas is needed for effective conservation strategies. Furthermore, persistent organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) like DDT were used in agricultural gardens and indoor spraying in Kanungu district between the 1950s and 80s. The focus of this study was to explore the possible exposure of mountain gorillas to OCPs and cypermethrin used by the farmers in the areas near the park. Data from our interviews revealed that glyphosate is the most widely used pesticide by the farmers in areas surrounding the park, followed by cypermethrin, and mancozeb. Samples of leaves from plants consumed by mountain gorillas along the forest edges of the park and surficial soils (15-20\u00a0cm depths) were collected from three sites (Ruhija, Nkuringo and Buhoma) and analysed for the presence of cypermethrin and OCPs residues. Concentrations of total (\u2211) DDTs and \u2211endosulfans were up to 0.34 and 9.89\u00a0mg/kg dry weight (d.w), respectively in soil samples. Concentrations of \u2211DDTs and \u2211endosulfans in samples of leaves ranged from 0.67 to 1.38\u00a0mg/kg d.w (mean\u00a0=\u00a01.07\u00a0mg/kg d.w) and 0.9 to 2.71\u00a0mg/kg d.w (mean\u00a0=\u00a01.68\u00a0mg/kg d.w), respectively. Mean concentration of \u2211DDTs in leaves exceeded the European pharmacopeia and United States pharmacopeia recommended maximum residue limit values for DDTs in medicinal plants (1.0\u00a0mg/kg). In addition, calculated hazard indices for silverbacks (36.35), females (57.54) and juveniles (77.04) suggested potential health risks to the mountain gorillas. o,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDT ratios (0.5-0.63) in samples of leaves confirmed recent input of dicofol-DDT type in Bwindi rainforest."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
