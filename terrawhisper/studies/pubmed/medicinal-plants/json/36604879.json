AMI rats underwent single injection of SM Glucose Injection, LH Glucose Injection, and LH-SM Glucose Injection in the caudal vein, respectively(3.78 mg\u00b7kg~(-1) salvianic acid, 0.049 mg\u00b7kg~(-1) rosmarinic acid, and 13.68 mg\u00b7kg~(-1) ligustrazine). Blood samples were collected from the orbital venous plexus at different time points, and the liver of the rats was removed after the last blood sampling. The plasma concentrations of salvianic acid, rosmarinic acid, and ligustrazine were detected by UPLC-MS/MS. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of CYP1 A2, CYP2 C11, CYP2 C19, CYP2 D4, CYP2 E1, and CYP3 A2 in the liver of rats in each group. As revealed by the pharmacokinetic results, compared with the LH Glucose Injection group, the LH-SM Glucose Injection group showed a downward trend of T_(1/2) of ligustrazine in AMI rats and decreased AUC(P&lt;0.05). Compared with the SM Glucose Injection, there were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of salvianic acid and rosmarinic acid in the LH-SM Glucose Injection group. Protein expression results showed that the expression levels of CYP1 A2, CYP2 C11, CYP2 D4, CYP2 E1, and CYP3 A2 in the LH-SM Glucose Injection group increased(P&lt;0.05) and the expression level of CYP2 C19 decreased(P&lt;0.05) compared with those in the LH Glucose Injection group. CYP1 A2, CYP2 C11, and CYP3 A2 are isoenzymes involved in ligustrazine \u2160 metabolism. When LH and SM were used in combination, the expression of these three enzymes increased, which changed the pharmacokinetic process in rats and accelerated the metabolism of ligustrazine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, State Key Laboratory of Efficacy and Utilization of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, State Key Laboratory of Efficacy and Utilization of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jing-Ya", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, State Key Laboratory of Efficacy and Utilization of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, State Key Laboratory of Efficacy and Utilization of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chun-Hua", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Ding-Yan", "Initials": "DY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, State Key Laboratory of Efficacy and Utilization of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V80F4IA5XG", "NameOfSubstance": "tetramethylpyrazine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rosmarinic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "23"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36604879", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220411.202"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
