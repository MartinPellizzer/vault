It is effective in the treatment of sepsis in clinical practice. However,due to the complexity of the prescription,its anti-sepsis mechanism is difficult to be clarified. The \" Cinnamomi Ramulus-Paeoniae Radix Alba\" drug pair,as the classic compatibility for medicinal and medicinal herbs,is the core of Guizhi Decoction. In this study,Cinnamomi Ramulus-Paeoniae Radix Alba drug pair was used as the research object and the molecular mechanism of its treatment of sepsis was investigated by analyzing the chemical compositions with integrative pharmacology platform( TCMIP,http://www.tcmip.cn/),predicting disease target,analyzing gene function and pathway of \" Cinnamomi Ramulus-Paeoniae Radix Alba\" in treatment of sepsis,and establishing a multi-dimensional network relationship of \" Chinese medicine-chemical components-core targets-key pathways\". The prediction results of \" Cinnamomi Ramulus-Paeoniae Radix Alba\" drug pair showed that its anti-sepsis effect was associated with 45 active components,and the active components played an anti-sepsis role through multiple targets and pathways,involving inflammatory targets such as PF4,MyD88,TLR4,BDKRB2,CD14,and NOS3. The sepsis was relieved mainly by regulating Toll like signaling pathway,Fox O signaling pathway,chemokines signaling pathway,thyroid and insulin endocrine signaling pathways and biological processes. This study provides a scientific basis for further development of Cinnamomi Ramulus-Paeoniae Radix Alba drug pair and Guizhi Decoction against sepsis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine,Key Laboratory of Systematic Research,Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST,Pharmacy College,Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137,China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Qing-Xin", "Initials": "QX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine,Key Laboratory of Systematic Research,Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST,Pharmacy College,Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137,China."}], "LastName": "Lyu", "ForeName": "Hong-Jun", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine,Key Laboratory of Systematic Research,Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST,Pharmacy College,Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology,Kaifeng Central Hospital Kaifeng 475000,China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine,Key Laboratory of Systematic Research,Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST,Pharmacy College,Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137,China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Nan", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamomum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Paeonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Sepsis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31359679", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190416.404"]}}]}
