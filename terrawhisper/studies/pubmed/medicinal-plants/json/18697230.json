The nitrogen concentration in needles, stems and roots of seedlings decreased significantly from the first to the second growing period (from 2.55, 1.30 and 2.19% to 1.19, 0.47 and 1.00%, respectively), with needles accounting for 53-58% of the pine-N. At the end of the experiment, 98.87 +/- 1.12% of the added ryegrass-(15)N was recovered: two-thirds in the soil organic N pool and one-third in the pine seedlings. Therefore, the post-fire pulse of inorganic-N, which was successfully kept in the burnt soil-plant system through its uptake by the pioneer species, is available for trees in the medium term. Pine seedlings assimilated 16.4% and 16.9% of the added ryegrass-(15)N in the first and second year, respectively. This result contrasts with the usual yearly decrease of added N uptake by plants; a possible explanation is the transient increase of available N in burnt soils that would have modified the mineralization pattern of the (15)N-labelled phytomass. The pine-N derived from the ryegrass-N decreased from 4.05% in the first year to 2.53% in the second one, with 3.10% being the 2-year weighed average. In addition to the direct contribution of ryegrass to pine-N nutrition reflected by these figures, the rapid post-fire establishment of a herbaceous cover on the burnt soil also provides important indirect benefits for tree nutrition by reducing organic- and inorganic-N losses."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaciones Agrobiol\u00f3gicas de Galicia, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Santiago de Compostela, Spain. serafin@iiag.csic.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Prieto", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Villar", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carballas", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "8802365", "ISSNLinking": "0951-4198"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Isotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fires"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pinus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18697230", "10.1002/rcm.3678"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
