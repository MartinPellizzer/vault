Considering that plant extracts are attractive sources of new drugs, the aim of the present study was to verify the influence of incorporating 70% hydroalcoholic of <i>M.\u00a0bella</i> leaves in nanostructured lipid systems on the mutagenic and antifungal activities of the extract. In this work, we evaluated the antifungal potential of <i>M.\u00a0bella</i> loaded on the microemulsion against <i>Candida</i> sp for minimum inhibitory concentration, using the microdilution technique. The system was composed of polyoxyethylene 20 cetyl ether and soybean phosphatidylcholine (10%), grape seed oil, cholesterol (10%: proportion 5/1), and purified water (80%). To investigate the mutagenic activity, the Ames test was used with the <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium tester strains. <i>M.\u00a0bella,</i> either incorporated or free, showed an important antifungal effect against all tested strains. Moreover, the incorporation surprisingly inhibited the mutagenicity presented by the extract. The present study attests the antimicrobial properties of <i>M.\u00a0bella</i> extract, contributing to the search for new natural products with biological activities and suggesting caution in its use for medicinal purposes. In addition, the results emphasize the importance of the use of nanotechnology associated with natural products as a strategy for the control of infections caused mainly by the genus <i>Candida</i> sp."], "CopyrightInformation": "Thieme.
