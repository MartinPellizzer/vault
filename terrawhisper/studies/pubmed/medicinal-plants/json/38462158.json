The disease's genesis is multifaceted, and its pathophysiology is complicated. Malfunction of mitochondria has been regarded as one of the intracellular events that are substantially damaged in the onset of AD and are likely a common trait of other neurodegenerative illnesses. Several mitochondrial characteristics begin to diminish with age, eventually reaching a state of significant functional failure concurrent with the beginning of neurodegenerative diseases, however, the exact timing of these processes is unknown. Mitochondrial malfunction has a multitude of negative repercussions, including reduced calcium buffering and secondary excitotoxicity contributing to synaptic dysfunction, also free radical production, and activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition. Hence mitochondria are considered a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's. Traditional medicinal systems practiced in different countries employing various medicinal plants postulated to have potential role in the therapy and management of memory impairment including amnesia, dementia as well as AD. Although, the preclinical and clinical studies using these medicinal plants or plant products have demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy for AD, the precise mechanism of action is still obscure. Therefore, this review discusses the contribution of mitochondria towards AD pathogenesis and considering phytotherapeutics as a potential therapeutic strategy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
