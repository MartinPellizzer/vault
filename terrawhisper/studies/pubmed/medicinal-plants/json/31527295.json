Malaria is still a health problem mainly because of the cost of effective antimalarial drugs and the growing parasite resistance to conventional antimalarial drugs, making a great proportion of the people in malaria endemic countries dependent on plants for its treatment. Corollary, a large number of the rural populations consume antimalarial herbal preparations in large or excessive quantities despite the fact that it has been reported that some of them could cause male-factor infertility, a growing global health concern. Few studies have compiled information on the scientifically validated male-factor antifertility effects of these antimalarial plant remedies. The aim of this review therefore is to compile information on commonly used antimalarial plant remedies that have been experimentally validated as having male-factor antifertility effects. Thus, antimalarial plant remedies with experimentally confirmed male-factor antifertility potentials and compounds isolated from them are identified and discussed. The male-factor antifertility effects of these plants include reduction of sperm quality, regulation of reproductive hormone levels and induction of lipid peroxidation. Indiscriminate use of such antimalarial plants is discouraged when male contraception is not desired."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6761-3798"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Medical Sciences Ondo, Ondo, Ondo State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Adewole", "ForeName": "Kayode Ezekiel", "Initials": "KE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Drug Development, University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Attah", "ForeName": "Alfred Francis", "Initials": "AF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Complement Integr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101313855", "ISSNLinking": "1553-3840"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimalarials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antimalarials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Infertility, Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31527295", "10.1515/jcim-2018-0214", "/j/jcim.ahead-of-print/jcim-2018-0214/jcim-2018-0214.xml"]}}]}
