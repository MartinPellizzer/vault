The isolates were characterized morphologically, biochemically and physiologically and the genus level identification of the selected strains was done by 16SrRNA gene sequencing. In small scale cultivation (50ml broth), the isolates were grown in A-medium to prepare the crude extracts. These crude extracts were subsequently evaluated for their antimicrobial, anticancer and antioxidant activity and the metabolomics profile of each of the extract was determined by TLC and HPLC-UV/MS.", "The taxonomic studies showed that the isolates belong to the group actinobacteria based on their morphological and physiological characteristics and the 16SrRNA gene sequencing of the selected strains identified the genera including <i>Streptomyces, Micromonospora</i> and <i>Nocardia</i>. Cumulatively,53% of extracts exhibited anti-Gram-(+) activity,47% exhibited anti-Gram-(-) activity,32% exhibited antifungal activity and 30% were cytotoxic to PC3 and A549 cancer cell lines and most of the extracts have shown antioxidant activity greater than 50%. The metabolomics analysis predicted the presence of an array of low molecular weight metabolites and indicated the promising isolates in collection for further studies for novel bioactive metabolite isolation and structure elucidation.", "Overall the study provides an overview of the endophytic actinobacteria residing in the roots of the selected medicinal plants prevalent in south Asian region and their potential to produce the medicinally and biotechnologically useful compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics (MMG), University of the Punjab, Lahore - Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Pharmaceutical Research and Innovation (CPRI) College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky - USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky - USA."}], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "Ashba", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Pharmaceutical Research and Innovation (CPRI) College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky - USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky - USA."}], "LastName": "Ponomareva", "ForeName": "Larissa V", "Initials": "LV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Pharmaceutical Research and Innovation (CPRI) College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky - USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky - USA."}], "LastName": "Thorson", "ForeName": "Jon S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Pharmaceutical Research and Innovation (CPRI) College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky - USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky - USA."}], "LastName": "Shaaban", "ForeName": "Khaled A", "Initials": "KA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics (MMG), University of the Punjab, Lahore - Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Pharmaceutical Research and Innovation (CPRI) College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky - USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky - USA."}], "LastName": "Sajid", "ForeName": "Imran", "Initials": "I"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P20 GM130456", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R37 AI052218", "Acronym": "AI", "Agency": "NIAID NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "UL1 TR000117", "Acronym": "TR", "Agency": "NCATS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "UL1 TR001998", "Acronym": "TR", "Agency": "NCATS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Adv Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101664376", "ISSNLinking": "2310-5380"}, "CoiStatement": "Competing Interest The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Bais HP, Weir TL, Perry LG, Gilroy S, Vivanco JM.
