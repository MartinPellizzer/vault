Here, D. nobile was regularly sprayed with different concentrations (0, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1000, 2000\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) of zinc to study its effect on the growth and biosynthesis of medicinal components. Samples were taken at 0, 7, 14, and 21 days to detect physiological and medicinal components. The results showed that the net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, and Chl A and Chl B levels of leaves first increased and then decreased as the concentration of zinc increased. At 400\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> concentration, these parameters reached their maximum values. Thus, a certain dose of zinc could promote the photosynthesis of D. nobile. There was an obvious increase in the synthesis of superoxide dismutase (SOD), while the content of ascorbate peroxidase and ascorbic acid (AsA) were the highest after treatment with 400\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> zinc. Maximum levels of polysaccharides and polyphenols were observed on day 7 and 14, respectively, at a zinc concentration of 400\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>. These results suggest that exogenous zinc may promote the accumulation of medicinal components in D. nobile. It was also found that polysaccharides could combine well with zinc to form a polysaccharide-zinc chelate and transform inorganic zinc into organic form, which is stored in the form of polysaccharide-Zn and is known to reduce the damage induced by Zn stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.
