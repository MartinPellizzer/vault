(lady's mantle) comprises 1000 species, of which more than 300 have been characterized from Europe. Notably, as folk medicines, Alchemilla species have long been prescribed for the treatment of dysmenorrhea, pruritus vulvae, menopausal complaints, and related diseases in women. This review summarizes the traditional uses, highlights promising plant species, and focuses on phytochemical and biological studies to highlight future areas of research.", "This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Alchemilla species, covering their botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, and biological and pharmacological activities, and to summarize the current research status to better understand the application value of Alchemilla plants in modern phytotherapy.", "The search strategy utilized the major thematic platforms Reaxys, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, ScienceDirect, PubMed, the USDA Plant Database and Kew Science (Royal Botanic Gardens) and was performed with the term Alchemilla. These platforms were systematically searched for articles published from 1960 to 2023.", "Alchemilla species, as members of the Rosaceae family, produce tannins, phenolic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins, coumarins, triterpenes and violet compounds. Effort has been made with this comprehensive review of Alchemilla plants to highlight the recent developments and milestones achieved in modern phytochemistry and phytotherapy, underlaying a broad spectrum of the activities of these plants, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antimicrobial, antiobesity, cardiovascular, anticancer, and wound healing effects.", "An increasing number of studies on the plants in the Alchemilla genus have provided data about the main constituents and their importance in modern medicine. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that Alchemilla plants possess an extensive spectrum of biological activities. Regardless of the remarkable medical potential of Alchemilla extracts, clinical studies are limited and need to be performed to produce safer and less expensive plant-based drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
