The concentration of adriamycin(ADM) in the cells was measured by reversal-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The immunofluorescence method was used to determine the expression of P-glucoprotein(Pgp) on cell membrane.", "When ADM was combined with Siwu Mixture, its concentration in the cells and the reversal index of MDR were significantly higher than those of blank control (P < 0.01). However, the expression of Pgp on cell membrane showed little difference ( P > 0.05).", "In case of noncytotoxic dose, Siwu Mixture showed significant effect on reversing MDR of cell line K562/ADM. The effect might be related to decreasing efflux of anticancer drugs in the cells and increasing their concentration in the cells. Nevertheless, it had no influence on the expression of Pgp on cell membrane."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chinese Science and Engineering, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiong University, Hangzhou 310027, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "80168379AG", "NameOfSubstance": "Doxorubicin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Angelica sinensis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Doxorubicin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Multiple"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "K562 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ligusticum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Paeonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rehmannia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15506297"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
