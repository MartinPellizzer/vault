The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Sebastiania hispida in an animal model with a wound infected by Staphylococcus aureus. The crude ethanol extract (Ext<sub>EtOH</sub>) of S. hispida underwent phytochemical analysis, quantification of metabolites and antibacterial activity analysis performed using S. aureus. Wistar rats were used to test healing activity, and the groups evaluated comprised gels of Ext<sub>EtOH</sub> at the concentrations 0.2 and 2% compared with control groups. Animals were inoculated with the bacteria S. aureus resistant to methicillin. The treatment periods were of 3 and 21 days. Macroscopic and microscopic analysis were conducted and data were submitted to analysis of variance (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Phytochemical and quantification analysis indicated that phenolic compounds and flavonoids are the major constituents, followed by tyterpenes. Ext<sub>EtOH</sub> 0.2% was the most effective gel against the growth of strains of S. aureus. Histological wound and regression analysis showed that Ext<sub>EtOH</sub> gels (0.2% and 2%) were similar and effective in promoting wound healing. In the quantification of collagen fibers, the animals from all groups showed a high amount of thick collagen fibers. Thus, Ext<sub>EtOH</sub> gels based on the shoots of S. hispida can be used for the treatment of infected wounds as a complementary therapy for infected wound closure and further assays are required with other means. The healing effectiveness may be due to the high content of phenolics, flavonoids and triterpenes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
