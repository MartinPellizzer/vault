In particular, Fritillariae Bulbus (FB) as a precious traditional medicine has thousands of years of medical history in China. Herbs of Fritillaria have a high market value and demand while limited by harsh growing circumstances and scarce wild resources. As a consequence, fraudulent behaviors are regularly engaged by the unscrupulous merchants in an attempt to reap greater profits. It is of an urgent need to evaluate the quality of Fritillaria herbs and their products using various analytical instruments and techniques. This review has scrutinized approximately 160 articles from 1995 to 2022 published on the investigation of Fritillaria herbs and related herbal products. The botanical classification of genus Fritillaria, types of counterfeits, technologies applied for differentiating Fritillaria species were comprehensively summarized and discussed in the current review. Molecular and chromatographic identification were the dominant technologies in the authentication of Fritillaria herbs. Additionally, we brought some potential and promising technologies and analytical strategies into attention, which are worthy attempting in the future researches. This review could conduce to excellent reference value for further investigations of the authenticity assessment of Fritillaria species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Research Center for Modernization of Traditional Chinese Medicine, National Engineering Research Center for TCM Standardization Technology, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Ya-Ling", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Research Center for Modernization of Traditional Chinese Medicine, National Engineering Research Center for TCM Standardization Technology, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Wen-Long", "Initials": "WL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Research Center for Modernization of Traditional Chinese Medicine, National Engineering Research Center for TCM Standardization Technology, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "De-An", "Initials": "DA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9004784", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8347"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "24"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36227577", "10.1080/10408347.2022.2132374"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
