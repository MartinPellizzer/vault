Soil and leaves from a traditional medicinal plant, <i>Vachellia karroo,</i> known as the sweet thorn plant, were assessed to determine the extent of pollution by PTEs from gold mine tailings in a case study area of Matjhabeng Local Municipality, South Africa. A risk classification tool was developed using the different indicators of pollution quantified to describe the pollution risk at each sampling site. High concentrations of copper, cadmium, lead, nickel, and zinc were measured in the soil, which exceeded the maximum permissible soil quality limits. The enrichment factor and geoaccumulation index results also confirmed heavy soil pollution by copper, nickel, and zinc, with exceptionally heavy pollution by cadmium and selenium. The PTEs in the soil were in an exchangeable form, with the sweet thorn plant accumulating lead and selenium at toxic levels, which poses a risk to the health of the local people as the plant is used for medicinal purposes. The overall pollution risk classification tool of the sampling sites showed that 17% were high-risk areas, 53% were moderate-risk areas, and 20% of the sites were low-risk areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7855-4626"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Environmental Management, University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Belle", "ForeName": "Gladys Nyoh", "Initials": "GN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Environmental Management, University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Oberholster", "ForeName": "Paul Johan", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Mastery, Boskruin View Office Park, Randburg, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Fossey", "ForeName": "Annabel", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences, Central University of Technology, Bloemfontein, Free State, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Esterhuizen", "ForeName": "Leana", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Physics, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Manchester, London, UK."}], "LastName": "Moodley", "ForeName": "Roshilia", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-57-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Gold"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7OV03QG267", "NameOfSubstance": "Nickel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H6241UJ22B", "NameOfSubstance": "Selenium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J41CSQ7QDS", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gold"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nickel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Selenium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Zinc"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mining"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36469548", "10.1080/10934529.2022.2151283"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
