However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of ML-I on natural host defenses are unknown. After 24 h incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the presence of 10 and 1 ng/ml of ML-I, mRNA expression and secretion of a panel of cytokines were evaluated by reverse polymerase chain reaction and by ELISA, respectively. The lectin induced expression of interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor and IL-10 genes but no expression of IL-2 and IL-5 genes could be detected. Regarding cytokine secretion, IL-6 and TNF-alpha production was induced by 10 ng/ml ML-I. On the other hand, IL-10 secretion was only stimulated by 1 ng/ml lectin. No production of IFN-gamma or, as expectable, IL-2 could be detected. In addition, ML-I increased the percentage of HLA-DR+ T lymphocytes in vitro. In tests performed on whole blood, monocytes and granulocytes bound the fluorescence-conjugated ML-I molecules to a higher degree than lymphocytes. Expression of IL-1 beta and IFN-gamma genes could also be observed upon ML-I stimulation of nonadherent cells. These results suggest that lectin-sugar interactions on the cell surface of immunocompetent cells can induce cytokine gene expression and protein synthesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Research, University Hospital of Basle, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Hostanska", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hajto", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Spagnoli", "ForeName": "G C", "Initials": "GC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fischer", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lentzen", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Herrmann", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Nat Immun", "NlmUniqueID": "9206126", "ISSNLinking": "1018-8916"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toxins, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "mistletoe lectin I"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ribosome inactivating protein, Viscum"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes, Mononuclear"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Toxins, Biological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8933823"]}}]}
