Here, we demonstrate that the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Colorless nonripening (Cnr) epimutant exhibits increased Fe retention in cell wall pectin due to an increase in pectin methylesterase (PME) activity. This ultimately leads to Fe deficiency responses even under Fe-sufficient conditions when compared to the wild type (WT). Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing revealed that modifications to cell wall-related genes, especially CG hypermethylation in the intron region of PECTIN METHYLESTERASE53 (SlPME53), are involved in the Cnr response to Fe deficiency. When this intron hypermethylation of SlPME53 was artificially induced in WT, we found that elevated SlPME53 expression was accompanied by increased PME activity and increased pectin-Fe retention. The manipulation of SlPME53, either through overexpression in WT or knockdown in Cnr, influenced levels of pectin methylesterification and accumulation of apoplast Fe in roots. Moreover, CG hypermethylation mediated by METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (SlMET1) increased SlPME53 transcript abundance, resulting in greater PME activity and higher Fe retention in cell wall pectin. Therefore, we conclude that the Cnr mutation epigenetically modulates SlPME53 expression by SlMET1-mediated CG hypermethylation, and thus the capacity of the apoplastic Fe pool, creating opportunities for genetic improvement of crop mineral nutrition."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
