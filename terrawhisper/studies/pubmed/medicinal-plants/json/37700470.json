It is a widely used traditional medicinal material with definite curative effect. At the same time, it is also a commonly used soup material among the folk in South China. In March 2022, a serious leaf spot disease with symptoms similar to anthracnose was observed on <i>F. hirta</i> in several plantations in Qinzhou and Zhanjiang City of China, with an incidence of 32~65%. The early symptoms of infected leaves were small, round, yellow spots that further expanded into larger, brown, irregular, necrotic lesions surrounded by dark brown edges, which eventually led to leaf wilt. Twenty symptomatic leaves were collected from three plantations with a total area of about 10 hm<u>2</u>. Fragments (2\u00d72 mm) from the 20 infected leaves were surface sterilized, plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 28\u00b0C. After 3 days, isolates with similar cultural morphology were obtained and three representative isolates (WZMT-1, WZMT-3 and WZMT-8) were randomly selected for following study. The colonies by single-spore purification on PDA were initially cottony, pale white and became grayish green with age. The conidia were hyaline, abundant, cylindrical, with rounded ends, 14.4~18.2 \u03bcm\u00d74.6~6.0 \u03bcm (av. 16.2 \u03bcm\u00d75.4 \u03bcm, n=100). Conidiogenous cells hyaline, cylindrical or ampulliform, 6.2~22.7 \u03bcm \u00d7 2.7~5.0 \u03bcm (av. 12.9 \u03bcm\u00d73.8 \u03bcm, n=50). Appressoria were brown to dark brown, ovoid to clavate, elliptical or irregular, 7.9~13.4 \u03bcm \u00d7 5.6~9.2 \u03bcm (av. 10.6 \u03bcm\u00d77.9 \u03bcm, n=50). The morphology of the fungus resembled <i>Colletotrichum fructicola</i> (Prihastuti et al. 2009). For molecular identification, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase (<i>GAPDH</i>), actin (<i>ACT</i>), beta-tubulin 2 (<i>TUB2</i>), calmodulin (<i>CAL</i>), partial manganese superoxide dismutase (<i>sod2</i>), partial Apn2-Mat1-2 intergenic spacer and partial mating type (Mat1-2) (<i>ApMat</i>) genes were amplified from genomic DNA for the isolates using the primers described by Silva et al. (2012) and Weir et al. (2012). The sequences of the above seven loci of the three isolates (accession nos. OQ121661 to OQ121663 and OQ133400 to OQ133417) were obtained and showed over 99% identity with the existing sequences of ex-type culture ICMP 18581 of <i>Colletotrichum fructicola</i> (Weir et al. 2012). A multilocus phylogenetic analysis of the seven loci concatenated sequences using the maximum likelihood method revealed that the isolates belong to <i>C. fructicola</i>. To confirm pathogenicity, five 3-month-old potted plants were used for inoculation with each representative isolate. Tested plants were sprayed with 10 ml of a conidial suspension (1 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> conidia/ml) , and the controls plants were sprayed with sterile water. All the plants were incubated in a growth chamber at 26 \u00b1 2\u00b0C with 95% relative humidity. After 10 days, typical lesions like those observed on the field plants appeared on all inoculated plants, while the control remained healthy. The same fungal pathogen was reisolated and the identity was confirmed by morphological characterization and molecular analysis, confirming Koch's postulates. The pathogen has been reported as the causal agent of anthracnose on a wide range of plant hosts worldwide (Marquez-Zequera et al. 2018; Horfer et al. 2021; Jiang et al. 2022; Li et al. 2023).
