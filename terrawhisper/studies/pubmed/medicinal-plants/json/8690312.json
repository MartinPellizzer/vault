A control group of 20 males and 20 females received 50 mg/kg (derived from the background level of alkaloid in lupin flour). The rats were treated for a minimum of 90-98 days. A dose-related reduction in red blood cell count and haematocrit (HCT) occurred in both sexes after 45 days, and the mean cell volume (MCV) was decreased in all the male treatment groups. The reductions in HCT and MCV persisted in the males until termination of the study when decreased haemoglobin levels were also observed in the top-dose males. The relative liver weights of female rats showed a dose-related increase. Altered foci of liver parenchymal cells were seen in five females receiving dietary levels of 5050 mg/kg, in one female fed 250 mg/kg and in one male from each of the 250 mg/kg and 1050 mg/kg treatment groups. No foci were seen in the control group. Basophilic foci are uncommon in young rats suggesting that the low incidence in this study is compound related."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BIBRA International, Carshalton, Surrey, UK."}], "LastName": "Butler", "ForeName": "W H", "Initials": "WH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ford", "ForeName": "G P", "Initials": "GP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Creasy", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8207483", "ISSNLinking": "0278-6915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Flour"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hematocrit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lethal Dose 50"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8690312", "10.1016/0278-6915(96)00025-7", "0278-6915(96)00025-7"]}}]}
