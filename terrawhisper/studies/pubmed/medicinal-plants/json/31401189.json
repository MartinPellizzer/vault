Decreased adhesive capacity, cytoskeletal reorganization, and increased mobility are hallmarks of the EMT. Several molecular mechanisms promote EMT, Including regulation of the levels of specific cell-surface proteins, ECM-degrading enzymes, and altering the expression of certain transcription factors and microRNAs. EMT process is modulated through multiple signaling pathways including the AKT/mTOR pathway. AKT is a key component in numerous processes which was recently shown to regulate the EMT through suppression of the expression of E-cadherin via EMT transcription factors. On the other hand, mTOR complexes can also regulate the EMT through the regulation of cell's actin cytoskeleton by altering the PKC phosphorylation state and direct phosphorylation and activation of Akt. Here we review the effect of AKT and mTOR on EMT and consequently metastasis and cell motility."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
