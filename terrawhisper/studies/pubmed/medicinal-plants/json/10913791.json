Each rat in these two behavioral experiments was tested with the three types of spatial-learning tasks (distance movement task, DMT; random-reward place search task, RRPST; and place-learning task, PLT) in a circular open field using intracranial self-stimulation as reward. The results in the DMT and RRPST tasks indicated that motivational and motor activity of young rats with hippocampal lesions with and without ginseng were not significantly different from that of sham-operated young rats in Experiment 1. However, young rats with hippocampal lesions displayed significant deficits in the PLT task. Treatment with red ginseng significantly ameliorated place-navigation deficits in young rats with hippocampal lesions on the PLT task. Similarly, red ginseng improved performance of aged rats on the PLT task in Experiment 2. The results, along with previous studies showing significant effects of red ginseng on the central nervous system, suggest that red ginseng ameliorates learning and memory deficits through effects on the central nervous system, partly through effects on the hippocampal formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Sugitani 2630, 930-0194, Toyama, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Y M", "Initials": "YM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishijo", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Uwano", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tamura", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kawanishi", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ono", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Physiol Behav", "NlmUniqueID": "0151504", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9384"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Association Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electric Stimulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrodes, Implanted"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood supply", "drug effects", "pathology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hippocampus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ischemic Attack, Transient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Memory"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Orientation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Self Stimulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spatial Behavior"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10913791", "10.1016/s0031-9384(00)00206-7", "S0031938400002067"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
