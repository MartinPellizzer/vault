Some mycotoxins are found in fruits, vegetables, and botanical roots. These contaminants have a broad range of toxic effects, including carcinogenicity, immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and reproductive and developmental toxicity. The public health concerns related to both acute and chronic effects of mycotoxins in animals have prompted more than 100 countries to establish regulatory limits for some of the well-known mycotoxins, such as the aflatoxins (AFL). Our research focused on method development for 2 of these toxins, AFL and ochratoxin A (OTA), in ginseng and other selected botanical roots. Methods using an immunoaffinity column (IAC) cleanup, liquid chromatographic separation, and fluorescence detection were modified and evaluated. Two types of IAC cleanup were evaluated: IAC for AFL, and IAC for both AFL and OTA. Three derivatization techniques to enhance the fluorescence of the AFL were compared: precolumn trifluoroacetic acid, postcolumn bromination, and postcolumn ultraviolet irradiation. No derivatization was needed for OTA. Results for AFL using the single analyte IAC cleanup and the 3 derivatization techniques were all comparable for ginseng and for other roots such as ginger, licorice, and kava-kava. Recoveries of added AFL for ginseng at levels from 2 to 16 ng/g were about 80%. Using IAC cleanup for both AFL and OTA recoveries of added AFL for ginseng at 4-16 ng/g were about 70%, and for ginger, licorice, and kava-kava were about 60%. Recoveries of added OTA for ginseng, ginger, and echinacea at 4 ng/g were about 55%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 5300 Paint Branch Pkwy, College Park, MD, USA. mary.trucksess@fda.hhs.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trucksess", "ForeName": "Mary", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weaver", "ForeName": "Carol", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oles", "ForeName": "Carolyn", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "D'Ovidio", "ForeName": "Kathleen", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rader", "ForeName": "Jeanne", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "223-01-2464", "Agency": "PHS HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J AOAC Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9215446", "ISSNLinking": "1060-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ochratoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1779SX6LUY", "NameOfSubstance": "ochratoxin A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry Techniques, Analytical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Affinity"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Ochratoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Miller JD.
