The 70% ethanol extract of A. chinense subsp. pauciflorum was isolated and purified by D-101 macroporous resins, silica gel, Sephadex LH-20 and other methods. As a result, nineteen compounds were isolated and identified as 4-cyclohexene-1\u03b1,2\u03b1,3\u03b1-triol-1-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside(1), 1\u03b2,4\u03b1,6\u03b1,13-tetrahydroxy-eudesm-11(12)-ene(2), sucrose(3), 1'-O-benzyl-\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1\u2033\u21926')-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside(4), bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzene-1,2-dicarboxylate(5),(Z)-10-heneicosenoic acid(6), di-O-methylcrenati(7), methyl-\u03b1-D-fructofuranoside(8), \u03b2-daucosterol(9), syringic acid(10), vanillicacid(11), octacosanol(12), isoarborinol(13), 2,7-dihydroxy-6-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)-1-naphthalenecarboxylate(14),vanillin(15), coniferyl aldehyde(16), 9(11)-dehydroergosterolperoxide(17), 5\u03b1,8\u03b1-epidioxy-(22E,24R)-ergosta-6,22-dien-3\u03b2-ol(18), \u03b2-sitosterol(19), respectively. Compounds 1 and 2 were new compounds, compounds 5-11, 13, 15-18 were isolated from Alangium for the first time.The anti-inflammatory activity of compourd 1 was determinded by the LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage inflammation model. The results showed that the new compound 1 has a certain inhibitory effect on LPS-induced NO production of RAW264.7 cells, and the inhibitory rate was 54.57%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine,Ministry of Education/State Key Laboratory of Efficacy and Utilization of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Qian-Qian", "Initials": "QQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine,Ministry of Education/State Key Laboratory of Efficacy and Utilization of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine,Ministry of Education/State Key Laboratory of Efficacy and Utilization of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Min-Hui", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine,Ministry of Education/State Key Laboratory of Efficacy and Utilization of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Mei-Qin", "Initials": "MQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine,Ministry of Education/State Key Laboratory of Efficacy and Utilization of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Preparation, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Preparation, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine,Ministry of Education/State Key Laboratory of Efficacy and Utilization of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Preparation, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yong-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alangiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38621877", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20231109.202"]}}]}
