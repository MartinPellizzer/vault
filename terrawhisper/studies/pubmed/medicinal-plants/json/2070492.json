The isolated DNA was analysed by 32P-postlabelling for the presence of aromatic adducts. Only lucidin formed up to five different DNA adducts in the range from 0.995 to 3.05 adducts/10(8) nucleotides. Lucidin was also incubated with polynucleotides poly[d(A-T)] and polydG*polydC in the presence of S9 mix. Analysis of polydG*polydC revealed a similar adduct pattern to that obtained with lucidin-modified DNA. Alizarin, lucidin, a glycoside mixture containing alizarinprimeveroside and lucidinprimeveroside, and Rubia Teep (a herbal drug made from Rubia tinctorum containing lucidin) were incubated with primary rat hepatocytes for 24 h and the isolated DNA was analysed by 32P-postlabelling. Lucidin, the glycoside mixture and Rubia Teep gave rise to DNA adducts, but alizarin did not. Male Parkes mice were treated orally for 4 days with alizarin (10 mg/d), lucidin (2 mg/d), the glycoside mixture (20 mg/d) or Rubia Teep (1/2 tablet/d) and DNA was isolated from liver, kidney, duodenum and colon. Analysis by 32P-postlabelling revealed that lucidin, the glycoside mixture and Rubia Teep, but not alizarin, formed DNA adducts in all the tissues examined but that the adduct patterns were organ-specific."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology, University of Hamburg Medical School, FRG."}], "LastName": "Poginsky", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Westendorf", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bl\u00f6meke", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Marquardt", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hewer", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grover", "ForeName": "P L", "Initials": "PL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "D H", "Initials": "DH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Carcinogenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8008055", "ISSNLinking": "0143-3334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthraquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60MEW57T9G", "NameOfSubstance": "alizarin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60Q5564O9D", "NameOfSubstance": "lucidin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Anthraquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2070492", "10.1093/carcin/12.7.1265"]}}]}
