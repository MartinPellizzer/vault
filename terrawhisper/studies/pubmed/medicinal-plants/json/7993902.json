The same substrate is also bound very tightly by the human and bovine enzymes, with Ki values of 8 and 25 microM, respectively. All three enzymes hydrate 2-acetamido-D-glucal, yielding N-acetyl-D-glucosamine as the product in each case. This is the first time that proton transfer has been shown to occur from the top face during the hydration of a glycal by a retaining beta-glycosidase. Kinetic studies of this hydration reaction with the jack bean enzyme demonstrate that the tight binding observed is due to the formation of a high-affinity, reversible complex, and not due to the accumulation of a reaction intermediate. This indicates that correctly substituted glycals might act as transition state mimics and suggests approaches to the design of high-affinity inhibitors of beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada."}], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "E C", "Initials": "EC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Withers", "ForeName": "S G", "Initials": "SG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0370623", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2960"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexosamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "10293-59-1", "NameOfSubstance": "2-acetamidoglucal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexosaminidases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hexosamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hexosaminidases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Binding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7993902", "10.1021/bi00253a012"]}}]}
