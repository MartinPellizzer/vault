Cogn in Wistar rats.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Kedrostis africana (L.) Cogn (Cucurbitaceae) is used in South African traditional medicine and pharmacopoeia as an emetic, purgative and diuretic, and it is used against dropsy in the management of obesity. Aim of the study In this study, acute and subacute toxicity of aqueous extract of K. africanatuber\u2009was evaluated in male and female Wistar rats in order to assess its safety profile. Materials and methods In acute toxicity, the effects of a single oral dose (2,000 and 5,000\u2009mg/kg) of aqueous extract was determined in both sexes. General behavior, adverse effects and mortality were determined for 3 h and then periodically for 14 days. The subchronic toxicity test was performed in rats. The effects of the extract in daily single oral administration at the doses of 200, 400 and 600\u2009mg/kg for 28 days were determined. Food and water intakes were monitored daily while body weight was monitored on a weekly bases. Hematological, biochemical and organ parameters were determined at the end of the 28-day administration. Results In the acute study, a single administration of the aqueous extract at the doses of 2,000 and 5,000\u2009mg/kg did not induce mortality. Thus, the LD50 of the aqueous extract of K. africana (AEKA) has been estimated to be higher than 5,000\u2009mg/kg. In the subchronic study, daily oral administration of the AEKA did not result in death of the rats or significant changes in hematological or biochemical parameters at the highest dose of 600\u2009mg/kg. No alteration was observed in body weight, food and water intake. Liver, kidney and heart histopathology did not reveal morphological alteration. Conclusions The results showed that the aqueous tuber extract of K. africana did not cause any death, nor did it cause abnormalities in necropsy and histopathology findings. There were no acute or subchronic toxicity observed, and this indicates that the plant extract could be considered safe for oral medication."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Economic Development (MPED) Research Centre, Department of Botany, University of Fort Hare, Alice 5700, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Unuofin", "ForeName": "Jeremiah Oshiomame", "Initials": "JO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Economic Development (MPED) Research Centre, Department of Botany, University of Fort Hare, Alice 5700, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Otunola", "ForeName": "Gloria Aderonke", "Initials": "GA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Economic Development (MPED) Research Centre, Department of Botany, University of Fort Hare, Alice 5700, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Afolayan", "ForeName": "Anthony Jide", "Initials": "AJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Complement Integr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101313855", "ISSNLinking": "1553-3840"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cucurbitaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lethal Dose 50"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests, Acute"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests, Subacute"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29791313", "10.1515/jcim-2017-0139", "/j/jcim.ahead-of-print/jcim-2017-0139/jcim-2017-0139.xml"]}}]}
