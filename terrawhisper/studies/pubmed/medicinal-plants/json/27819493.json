The current research was conducted to study the effect of Pseudomonas fluorescens RB4 and Bacillus subtilis 189 on the growth and phytoremediation potential of Catharanthus roseus in Cu- and Pb-contaminated soils. The bacterial strains exhibited significantly higher level of water-extractable Pb and Cu in Pb, Cu, and Cu+Pb-contaminated. The P. fluorescens RB4 inoculated plants, produced 102%, 48%, and 45% higher fresh weight (FW) in soils contaminated with Cu, Pb, and both elements, respectively, as compared to un-inoculated control plants. Similarly, B. subtilis 189 inoculated plants produced 108%, 43%, and 114% more FW in the presence of Cu, Pb, and both elements. The plants co-cultivated with both bacteria exhibited 121%, 102%, and 177% higher FW, in Cu, Pb, and both elements contaminated soils, as compared to respective un-inoculated control. Co-cultivation of P. fluorescens RB4, B. subtilis 189, and P. fluorescens RB4 + B. subtilis 189 resulted in higher accumulation of Cu and Pb in shoots of the C. roseus grown in contaminated soils as compared to un-inoculated control. Bacterial treatments also improved the translocation and metal bioconcentration factors. The growth and phytoextraction capability of C. roseus was improved by inoculation of P. fluorescens RB4 and B. subtilis 189."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a College of Earth and Environmental Sciences , University of the Punjab , Lahore , Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Waheed Ullah", "Initials": "WU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a College of Earth and Environmental Sciences , University of the Punjab , Lahore , Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Sajid Rashid", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b University of the Punjab , Resident Office-II , Lahore , Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Yasin", "ForeName": "Nasim Ahmad", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Botany , University of Sargodha , Sargodha , Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Aamir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Institute for Medicinal Plants, College of Plant Science and Technology , Huazhong Agricultural University , Wuhan , China."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Aqeel", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Phytoremediation", "NlmUniqueID": "101136878", "ISSNLinking": "1522-6514"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Catharanthus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas fluorescens"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27819493", "10.1080/15226514.2016.1254154"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
