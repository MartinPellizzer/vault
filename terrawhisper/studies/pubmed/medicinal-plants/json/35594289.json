As a natural antifungal agent, clove essential oil (CEO) is a substance generally recognised as safe (GRAS) and shows strong activity against fungal pathogens. Here, we aimed to investigate the control efficacy of CEO in nano-emulsions (CEN) against OTA production in licorice roots and rhizomes during storage. The experiments were performed under simulated conditions of all four seasons (i.e. Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter). Relative humidity (RH) and temperature were simulated in desiccators along with various salt solutions in incubators. Fresh licorice roots were immersed in CEN at various concentrations (150, 300, 600, 1200 and 2400\u2009\u00b5l/l). Before utilising the nano-emulsions, we measured their polydispersity index and mean droplet size by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique. Also, the chemical composition of the CEO was determined using GC and GC-MS analyses. Sampling was carried out to monitor OTA once every five days. The samples were dried immediately and analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results showed that various concentrations of CEN inhibited the growth of fungi and OTA production. The most effective CEN concentrations were 1200 and 2400\u2009\u00b5l/l, which reduced OTA production to 19 and 20\u2009ppb under Winter and Autumn conditions, respectively. These results suggest an effective eco-friendly method for the storage of licorice to reduce postharvest fungal decay."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, School of Agriculture, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Haghighi", "ForeName": "Tahereh Movahhed", "Initials": "TM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, School of Agriculture, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Processing Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Saharkhiz", "ForeName": "Mohammad Jamal", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, School of Natural Sciences, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Khalesi", "ForeName": "Mohammadreza", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, School of Agriculture, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mousavi", "ForeName": "Seyyed Sasan", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, School of Agriculture, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ramezanian", "ForeName": "Asghar", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "101485040", "ISSNLinking": "1944-0057"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ochratoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ochratoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Penicillium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35594289", "10.1080/19440049.2022.2077460"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
