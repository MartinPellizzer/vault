Advanced liver illnesses can develop from the prevalent clinical condition known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). There is no effective treatment, is still unclear. Therefore, in order to create novel therapeutics, it is necessary to comprehend the pathogenic pathways causing disease onset and progression. Natural components from medicinal plants are currently the subject of a larger number of studies since they provide fresh promise for NASH. This review provided an overview of the aetiology of NASH, in addition the role of natural products as alternative or complementary therapeutic agent for management of NASH <i>via</i> autophagy induction. It was concluded that, alternative and complementary supplement of natural functional food as Arabica coffee that rich with chlorogenic acid targeting autophagy mechanism mediate amelioration effect of NASH."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mohamed", "ForeName": "Merehan Alaa-ElDin", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Rihan", "ForeName": "Shaimaa", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Biotechnology, October University for Modern Sciences and Arts, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Elbakry", "ForeName": "Mustafa M M", "Initials": "MMM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Moselhy", "ForeName": "Said S", "Initials": "SS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "58"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38362886", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2316328"]}}]}
