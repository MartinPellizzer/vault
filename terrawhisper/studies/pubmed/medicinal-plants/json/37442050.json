Ginseng plants grown in mountain have longer longevity which ensures higher accumulation of ginsenoside components than those grown in farms. However, wild-simulated ginseng over certain age cannot be easily distinguished in morphology. To identify transcriptomic mechanism of ginsenoside accumulation in older wild-simulated ginseng without large phenotype change, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis for leaf, shoot, and root tissues of 7-yr-old and 13yr-old wild-simulated ginseng. Of 559 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in comparison between 7-yr-old and 13yr-old wild-simulated ginseng, 280 leaf-, 103 shoot-, and 164 root-mainly expressing genes were found to be changed in transcript level according to age. Functional analysis revealed that pentose-phosphate shunt and abscisic acid responsive genes were up-regulated in leaf tissues of 7-yr-old ginseng while defense responsive genes were up-regulated in root tissues of 13-yr-old ginseng. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that jasmonic acid responsive genes, ERDL6, and some UGTs were up-regulated in 13-yr-old ginseng in higher order lateral root tissues. These data suggest that bacterial stimulation in mountain region can enhance the expression of several genes which might support minor ginsenoside biosynthesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
