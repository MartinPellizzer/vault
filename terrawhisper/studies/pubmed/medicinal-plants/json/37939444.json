Then, their bio-activity against the \u03b1-glucosidase (\u03b1-Glu) was further evaluated. Among them, almost all compounds displayed better bio-activity with IC<sub>50</sub> from 31.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.89 to 213.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.19\u00a0\u03bcM than acarbose (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0700.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.55\u00a0\u03bcM). In particular, compound 5o showed the best potency to inhibit \u03b1-Glu in a mixed manner. Moreover, the action mechanisms of 5o were further clarified including fluorescence quenching, circular dichroism spectra, three-dimensional fluorescence spectra, molecular docking, etc. All mechanism studies revealed that 5o could arouse the changed secondary structure of \u03b1-Glu to hinder enzyme catalytic activity. It was observed from an in vivo study that 5o of 20\u00a0mg/kg could significantly decrease by 24.45\u00a0% postprandial blood glucose in mice vs. the control. Meanwhile, 5o had low drug-drug interaction potential and was likely to be an orally active compound. Moreover, 5o was observed to be no obvious cytotoxicity to HEK-293\u00a0cells. In summary, compound 5o exhibited one potential to be further applied as an antidiabetic drug."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
