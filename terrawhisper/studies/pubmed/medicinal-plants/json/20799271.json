A comprehensive study on the major phytochemicals in different plant parts (fruit, leaf, seed, root and flower) and sources is of great value for fully understanding their diverse medicinal benefits.", "To quantitatively determine the major iridoid components in different parts of noni plants, and compare iridoids in noni fruits collected from different tropical areas worldwide.", "The optimal chromatographic conditions were achieved on a C(18) column with gradient elution using 0.1% formic acid aqueous formic acid and acetonitrile at 235\u2009 nm. The selective HPLC method was validated for precision, linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantitation and accuracy.", "Deacetylasperulosidic acid (DAA) was found to be the major iridoid in noni fruit. In order of predominance, DAA concentrations in different parts of the noni plant were dried noni fruit > fruit juice > seed > flower > leaf > root. The order of predominance for asperulosidic acid (AA) concentration was dried noni fruit > leaf > flower > root > fruit juice > seed. DAA and AA contents of methanolic extracts of noni fruits collected from different tropical regions were 13.8-42.9 and 0.7-8.9 \u2009mg/g, respectively, with French Polynesia containing the highest total iridoids and the Dominican Republic containing the lowest.", "Iridoids DAA and AA are found to be present in leaf, root, seed and flower of noni plants, and were identified as the major components in noni fruit. Given the great variation of iridoid contents in noni fruit grown in different tropical areas worldwide, geographical factors appear to have significant effects on fruit composition. The iridoids in noni fruit were stable at the temperatures used during pasteurisation and, therefore, may be useful marker compounds for identity and quality testing of commercial noni products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research and Development Department, Tahitian Noni International, 737 East, 1180 South, American Fork, UT 84003, USA. shixin_deng@tni.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Shixin", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "West", "ForeName": "Brett J", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Palu", "ForeName": "'Afa K", "Initials": "'K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jensen", "ForeName": "C Jarakae", "Initials": "CJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochem Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "9200492", "ISSNLinking": "0958-0344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "asperulosidic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Beverages"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iridoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Morinda"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20799271", "10.1002/pca.1246"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
