Antenatal care included avoidance of exposure to heat, no sleep during the day, and plenty of nourishment, although certain dietary precautions were recommended. Moderate intercourse during the first trimester was permitted but prohibited near the time of parturition. In general, midwives counseled the prospective mother to eat well, to rest physically and mentally, and to engage very moderately in manual labor. Massage was given at regular intervals, and vapor baths were taken. Juices of medicinal plants were administered during labor both to expedite it and to relieve pain. Women assumed a squatting position during labor, which was also assisted by abdominal massage and the manual dilation of the vulva. If parturition was prolonged, pressure was applied by the midwife who used her feet for this purpose. The child was bathed immediately after birth. Lactation was prolonged among the Mexicans."]}], "GeneralNote": [], "PMID": "12261469", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1980", "Month": "06", "Day": "10"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "03"}, "Article": {"ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Language": ["eng"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0743-3131", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "4", "Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1932", "Month": "Mar"}}, "Title": "Annals of medical history", "ISOAbbreviation": "Ann Med Hist"}, "ArticleTitle": "Obstetrics in Mexico prior to 1600.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "203", "EndPage": "212", "MedlinePgn": "203-12"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van Patten", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Med Hist", "NlmUniqueID": "15020250R", "ISSNLinking": "0743-3131"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Americas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Community Health Workers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Demography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnicity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indians, North American"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Latin America"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Midwifery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "North America"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Characteristics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Dynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy in Adolescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sexual Behavior"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1932", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1932", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1932", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12261469", "PMC7945238"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
