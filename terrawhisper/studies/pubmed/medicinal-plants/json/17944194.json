The ratio of cell proliferation was determined by non-radioactive MTS/PES as-say.

It was shown that TNF-alpha significantly induced rat VSMCs proliferation (P < 0.05). The ratio of cell proliferatioh was 0.905 +/- 0.044 in flavone from leaves of Diospyros kaki group corresponding to concentration of 50 microg/ml. It was shown that flavone from leaves of Diospyros kaki alone had no effect on rat VSMCs proliferation (p > 0.05). With TNF-alpha stimulation, flavone from leaves of Diospyros kaki significantly inhibited rat expression of ASK1 protein enhanced by TNF-alpha was significantly inhibited rat-VSMNCs proliferation (1.247 +/- 0.061 vs. 1.865 +/- 0.093, p < 0.05).
