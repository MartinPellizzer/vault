PKC is a key factor in cardiovascular and other disorders; targeting it can reduce the risk of these diseases. We evaluated Allium humile for PKC inhibition and therapeutic efficacy against atherosclerosis. Soxhlet extraction was done to obtain extracts (hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol, ethanol and aqueous) and then tested for DPPH radical scavenging and PKC inhibitory activity. The methanolic extract was more active than the other extracts, so it was subjected to column chromatography, and seventeen fractions were obtained. Only 11, 12, and 15 showed good activity against PKC. Wistar rats were divided into six groups and each group received high fat diet for 30\u00a0days. Then the three potent fractions (10\u00a0mg/kg) were administered for 15\u00a0days along with high fat diet. Fraction II had the highest effectiveness (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) in decreasing lipid levels, lipid peroxidation, reducing IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 expression, and raising nitric oxide. This also demonstrated a decrease in PKC activity, as well as a decrease in the formation of the lipoidal layer in the aorta wall and rupture of the intima and media as validated by histological analysis. The two compounds, phytol acetate and cyanidin 3-(6\u2033-o-malonyllaminaribioside) were characterised in fraction II by NMR and HRMS and cyanidin 3-(6\u2033-o-malonyllaminaribioside) inhibited PKC more efficiently. Thus, Allium humile has strong anti-atherogenic activity as well as the ability to inhibit PKC both in vitro and in vivo."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
