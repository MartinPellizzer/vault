The participant's bio-data, clinical conditions treated, methods of treatment, medicinal plants used, methods of preparation and administration, and dosage forms were recorded.", "A total of 99 medicinal plants and 12 complementary preparations employed in the treatment of 64 medical conditions were identified. The most widely used plant was <i>Rotala tenella</i> which was used to treat nine medicinal conditions; seven each for <i>Aloe tweediae</i> and <i>Dovyalis abyssinica</i>; and six each for <i>Basella alba</i> and <i>Euclea divinorum</i>. The plants belonged to 55 families with Fabaceae family being the most frequently used (10), followed by Apocynaceae and Solanaceae, each with six species, respectively. We identified plants used to determine the sex of an unborn baby and those used to treat several conditions including anthrax and cerebral malaria and herbs used to detoxify meat from an animal that has died from anthrax. Of special interest was <i>R. tenella</i> which is used to prevent muscle injury.", "We have documented several plants with potential therapeutic effects.
