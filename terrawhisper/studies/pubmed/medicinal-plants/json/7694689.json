In 80% of cells 10(-6) M TG blocked Ca2+ uptake by SR at rest, depleted the SR Ca2+, inhibited postrest potentiation and changed the pattern of response to premature contractions. Amplitude of steady state contractions was reduced to 11 +/- 4% of pre-TG control. In 20% of cells TG had similar effect on the SR function, however, amplitude of contractions was reduced to only 50 +/- 7% of control. It is concluded that the results obtained in 80% of the cells are compatible with the wide-spread notion that contractions of rat cardiac myocytes are activated predominantly by Ca2+ released from SR. However, population of myocytes of ventricular myocardium of this species is not homogeneous in this respect. In 20% of them contractions are activated by both sarcolemmal and SR Ca2+ contribution being approximately equal. These cells occupy intermediate position between guinea-pig cells and the bulk of rat cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Physiology, Medical Centre of Postgraduate Education, Warsaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Lewartowski", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wolska", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "J Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9114501", "ISSNLinking": "0867-5910"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "67526-95-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Thapsigargin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Ventricles"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine Release"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sarcoplasmic Reticulum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thapsigargin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7694689"]}}]}
