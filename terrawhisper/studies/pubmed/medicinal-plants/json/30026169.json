The aim of this study was (1) to identify wild medicinal species and evaluate their local importance in local peoples' healthcare as well as in protected area conservation; and (2) to compare traditional medicinal plant knowledge among the informants.", "A total of 206 M\u00fc\u00fcn, Ng'gah and Daai informants from 20 villages were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. Species use-reports were computed to determine plant local importance and the informant consensus factor. Descriptive and the inferential statistics Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were employed to evaluate and compare the informants' traditional medicinal knowledge.", "A total of 75 wild ethnomedicinal taxa in 40 plant families across 16 ICPC-based disease categories were recorded. Species which recorded the highest number of use-reports appeared to play an important role not only in informants' primary healthcare and in park conservation, but also in local livelihood.", "This study presents the diversity of ethnomedicinal plants and their local importance in Chin indigenous peoples' healthcare.
