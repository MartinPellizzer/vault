A total of 7 samples from Jiangsu, Fujian, Shanghai, and Zhejiang were collected, which were then cultivated with conventional method and mycorrhizal fungi, separately. The content of 17 mineral elements in stems and leaves was measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry(ICP-MS), and the content changes of the mineral elements were analyzed. The health risks of Pb, Cd, Hg, and As in stems were assessed by target hazard quotient(THQ). The results showed that the content of polluting elements in stems and leaves of D. officinale was low, and the content in the plants cultivated with mycorrhizal fungi was reduced. The content of K, Ca, Mg, and P was high in stems and leaves of the species, suggesting that cultivation with mycorrhizal fungi improved the content of other elements irregularly. According to the THQ, the safety risk of stems of D. officinale cultivated with either conventional method or mycorrhizal fungi was low, particularly the D. officinale cultivated mycorrhizal fungi. The results indicated that cultivation with mycorrhizal fungi influenced the element content in stems and leaves of D. officinale. It is necessary to study the culture substrate, processing technology, and the mechanism of the increase or decrease in mineral elements of D. officinale in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jia-Qi", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Li-Xia", "Initials": "LX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xiao-Mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Shun-Xing", "Initials": "SX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mycorrhizae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "33"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36472000", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220623.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
