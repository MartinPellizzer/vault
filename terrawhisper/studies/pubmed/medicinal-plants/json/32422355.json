Grey correlation analysis was applied to establish the spectral effect relationship and give the anticoagulant potency of different saponins. Network pharmacology and molecular docking were adopted to clarify and verify the possible mechanisms of anticoagulant action.", "The results showed that the blood physiological regulation activities of Panax medicinal plants were different according to the solvent concentration, processing, species and dosage. Overall, the most suitable solvent for extraction of SQ was 75% ethanol; At low dosage (10-100\u202fmg/mL), the anticoagulant effect of Panax medical plants was: ZJS\u202f>\u202fZZS\u202f>\u202fSQ\u202f>\u202fRS\u202f>\u202fHS, and at high doses (100-1000\u202fmg/mL) was: SQ\u202f>\u202fZJS\u202f>\u202fZZS\u202f>\u202fRS\u202f>\u202fHS. GRA and molecular docking results showed the contribution of some components (NG-R2, NG-Fc/G-Ra1/G-Ra2, G-Rc, G-Rk3, and G-Rh4) to the whole anticoagulant activity of the drug were increased, while the effect of CS-IVa was just decreased with the increase of dosage; the anticoagulant effect of G-Rg3 (the main anticoagulant component) is mainly related to the targets F2, AR, RHO, ACR, MB, GZMB, B2M, CA2, CAT, and PAPOLA.", "This study determined the effective substance of anti-coagulation of ginseng genus herbal medicines and the regulation of different anticoagulant effects of TCM by changing various influencing conditions, including processing method, extraction method, and dose. It also provided an effective strategy for effective substances identification of multicomponent, multifunction, and multipurpose herbal medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
