Among them, WVV has been transplanted from its top-geoherb region, Guangdong, to its current main production area, Yunnan, for >50\u00a0years in China. However, the genetic and transcriptomic differentiation among multiple AF source species (or varieties)\u00a0and between the origin and transplanted populations of WVV is unknown. In our study, the observed overall higher expression of terpenoid biosynthesis genes in WVV than in WVX provided possible evidence for the better pharmacological effect of WVV. We also screened six candidate borneol dehydrogenases (BDHs) that potentially catalyzed borneol into camphor in WVV and functionally verified them. Highly expressed genes at the P2 stage of WVV, <i>Wv05G1424</i> and <i>Wv05G1438</i>, were capable of catalyzing the formation of camphor from (+)-borneol, (-)-borneol and DL-isoborneol. Moreover, the <i>BDH</i> genes may experience independent evolution after acquiring the ancestral copies, and the following tandem duplications might account for the abundant camphor content in WVV. Furthermore, four populations of WVV, WVX, and WL are genetically differentiated, and the gene flow from WVX to WVV in Yunnan contributed to the greater genetic diversity in the introduced population (WVV-JH) than in its top-geoherb region (WVV-YC), which showed the lowest genetic diversity and might undergo genetic degradation. In addition, <i>terpene synthesis</i> (<i>TPS</i>) and <i>BDH</i> genes were selected among populations of multiple AF source species (or varieties)\u00a0and between the top- and non-top-geoherb regions, which might explain the difference in metabolites between these populations. Our findings provide important guidance for the conservation, genetic improvement, and industrial development of the three source species (or varieties)\u00a0and for identifying top-geoherbalism with molecular markers, and proper clinical application of AF."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.
