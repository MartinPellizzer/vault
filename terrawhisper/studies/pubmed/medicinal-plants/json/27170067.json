Among these isolates, 12 were screened for their plant growth promoting abilities and antagonistic potential against Sc.\u00a0rolfsii. Further, these isolates were validated in\u00a0vivo for their ability to protect chickpea against Sc.\u00a0rolfsii infestation under greenhouse conditions. The isolates significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b705) increased the biomass (1\u00b72-2\u00b70 fold) and reduced plant mortality (42-75%) of chickpea. On the basis of 16S rDNA profiling, the selected antagonistic strains were identified as Streptomyces diastaticus, Streptomyces fradiae, Streptomyces olivochromogenes, Streptomyces collinus, Streptomyces ossamyceticus and Streptomyces griseus.", "This study is the first report of the isolation of endophytic Actinomycetes from various medicinal plants having antagonistic and plant growth promoting abilities.
