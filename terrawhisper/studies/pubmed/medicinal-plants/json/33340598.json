Medicinal plants have many benefits for infertility treatment in men.", "In the present study, we evaluated in vitro effects of Capparis spinosa leaf extract on human sperm function, DNA fragmentation, and oxidative stress.", "We conducted this study on the hydroalcoholic extract of C. spinosa. Polyphenol compounds and antioxidant effects of the leaf and fruit extract were determined by HPLC and DPPH method, respectively. Flavones and flavonols, total flavonoid, total phenolic content, tannin, and the total carbohydrate content were determined calorimetrically. Semen samples from 50 healthy men (20-45 years) were divided into control and experimental (15, 30, and 45\u00a0ppm of C. spinosa leaf extract) groups. Motility, viability, lipid peroxidation, and DNA fragmentation were evaluated 24\u00a0h after incubation.", "The antioxidant effect of leaf extract was six times greater than fruit. Progressive and total motility of caper-treated groups (30 and 45\u00a0ppm) were crucially higher than the control group. Viability in all treatments was significantly higher than the control group. There was no significant difference in lipid peroxidation. DNA fragmentation in the caper-treated group (45\u00a0ppm) was significantly lower than the control group.", "Our results suggest the potential positive in vitro effect of C. spinosa leaf extract on human sperm function. The use of C. spinosa leaf extract or its active metabolites in the sperm culture medium may be beneficial for maintaining motility, vitality, and sperm DNA. Since these effects were observed at very low concentrations of caper, other non-antioxidant mechanisms must be considered."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
