The medicinal material of Cameroon can provide much information on ethnic folklore practices and traditional aspects of therapeutically important natural products. Cameroon has a very rich cultural diversity with different traditional systems of medicine that need more evidence-based studies on both crude extracts and purified phytomolecules. Therefore, an ethnobotanical study was conducted on 58 socio-cultural population groups living in different phytogeographic units of Cameroon in order to collect various medicinal plants or recipes. A two by two comparison of social-cultural groups of the same phytogeographic unit indicated a significant difference in 86.97% of medicinal plants or recipes comparisons' cases. A total of two hundred and eight recipes were identified, among which 75 were used for diabetes and hypertension treatment, 74 for hypertension alone, and 59 for diabetes alone. Also, two hundred and three plants were identified among which 33 were cultivated and marketed by 25 farming families engaged in integrated agriculture and selling of antidiabetic and antihypertensive plants to enhance their socio-economic status."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Research on Medicinal Plants and Traditional Medicine, Institute of Medical Research and Medicinal Plants Studies.
