Since adult neurogenesis has been confirmed in the human brain, great interest has arisen in substances stimulating the endogenous neuronal regeneration mechanism based on adult neural stem cells. Medicinal plants are a valuable source of neuroactive small molecules. In the structure-activity study presented here, the activities of prenyl- and pyranochalcones were compared to each other, using a differentiation assay based on the doublecortin promoter sequences. The latter revealed that the pyrano ring is a crucial structural element for the induction of neuronal differentiation of adult neural stem cells, while compounds with a prenyl group show significantly lower activities. Furthermore, a decrease of pro-differentiation activity was observed following structural modifications, such as substitutions on the pyrano ring and on the B-ring of the chalcone. We also initiated the elucidation of the structural characteristics of the newly discovered lead substance xanthohumol C, which correlated with the activation of the doublecortin promoter during neuronal differentiation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8895-9416"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Weihenstephan-Triesdorf University of Applied Sciences, Organic-analytical Chemistry, 94315 Straubing, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "TUM Campus Straubing for Biotechnology and Sustainability, Technical University of Munich, 94315 Straubing, Germany."}], "LastName": "Urmann", "ForeName": "Corinna", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Experimental Neuroregeneration, Spinal Cord Injury and Tissue Regeneration Center Salzburg, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, 5020 Salzburg, Austria."}], "LastName": "Bieler", "ForeName": "Lara", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Regenerative Medicine, Spinal Cord Injury and Tissue Regeneration Center Salzburg, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, 5020 Salzburg, Austria."}], "LastName": "Priglinger", "ForeName": "Eleni", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Regenerative Medicine, Spinal Cord Injury and Tissue Regeneration Center Salzburg, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, 5020 Salzburg, Austria."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Austrian Cluster for Tissue Regeneration, https://www.tissue-regeneration.at/."}], "LastName": "Aigner", "ForeName": "Ludwig", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Experimental Neuroregeneration, Spinal Cord Injury and Tissue Regeneration Center Salzburg, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, 5020 Salzburg, Austria."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Austrian Cluster for Tissue Regeneration, https://www.tissue-regeneration.at/."}], "LastName": "Couillard-Despres", "ForeName": "Sebastien", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Weihenstephan-Triesdorf University of Applied Sciences, Organic-analytical Chemistry, 94315 Straubing, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "TUM Campus Straubing for Biotechnology and Sustainability, Technical University of Munich, 94315 Straubing, Germany."}], "LastName": "Riepl", "ForeName": "Herbert M", "Initials": "HM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chalcones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Humulus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Neural Stem Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neurogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regeneration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34542287", "10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c00505"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
