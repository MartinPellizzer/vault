It exhibits a wide range of biological activities. This study displayed that AA effectively alleviated EAE, a classical mouse model of multiple sclerosis. AA administered to the EAE greatly decreased inflammatory cell infiltration to the CNS and protected the myelin integrity in the white matter of the spinal cord. AA could block lipopolysaccharide-induced DC activation. inhibited the polarization of 2D2 mice-derived T cells by inhibiting the DCs activity. Immunoblot results indicated that the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB is significantly suppressed in AA-treated DCs. This work displayed that AA possessed a potential anti-inflammatory therapeutic effect for the treatment of autoimmune disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
