Among several cytological endpoints in these fast dividing cells, such as chromosome/chromatid aberrations, sister-chromatid exchanges and micronuclei, the most effective and simplest indicator of cytological damage is micronucleus formation. Although the Allium cepa and Vicia faba root meristem micronucleus assays (Allium/Vicia root MCN) have been used in clastogenicity studies about 12 times by various authors in the last 25 years, there is no report on the comparison of the efficiency of these two plant systems and in different cell populations (meristem and F1) of the root tip as well as under adequate recovery duration. In order to maximize the efficiency of these bioassays, the current study was designed to compare the Allium and the Vicia root MCN assays on the basis of chromosome length, peak sensitivity of the mitotic cells, and the regions of the root tip where the MCN are formed. The total length of the 2n complement of Allium chromosomes is 14.4 microns and the total length of the 2n complement of Vicia is 9.32 microns. The peak sensitivity determined by serial fixation at 12-h intervals after 100 R of X-irradiation is 44 h. The slope of the X-ray dose-response curve of Allium roots derived from the meristematic regions was lower than that derived from cells in the F1 region. Higher efficiency was also demonstrated when the MCN frequencies were scored from the F1 cells in both Allium and Vicia treated with formaldehyde (FA), mitomycin C (MMC), and maleic hydrazide (MH). The results indicated that scoring of MCN frequencies from the F1 cell region of the root tip was more efficient than scoring from the meristematic region. The X-ray linear regression dose-response curves were established in both Allium and Vicia cell systems and the coefficients of correlations, slope values were used to verify the reliability and efficiency of these two plant cell systems. Based on the dose-response slope value of 0.894 for Allium and 0.643 for Vicia, the Allium root MCN was a more efficient test system. The greater sensitivity of the Allium roots is probably due to the greater total length of the diploid complement and the higher number of metacentric chromosomes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Western Illinois University, Macomb 61455, USA."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "T H", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "McConnell", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rabago", "ForeName": "E V", "Initials": "EV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Arreola", "ForeName": "G A", "Initials": "GA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1HG84L3525", "NameOfSubstance": "Formaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "50SG953SK6", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitomycin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FST467XS7D", "NameOfSubstance": "Saccharin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TQ7L3FCV66", "NameOfSubstance": "Maleic Hydrazide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Allium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Formaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Maleic Hydrazide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Meristem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Micronucleus Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mitomycin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitotic Index"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Saccharin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7885371", "10.1016/0165-1161(95)90010-1", "0165-1161(95)90010-1"]}}]}
