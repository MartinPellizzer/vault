In addition, some older Moslem women presented during the same time with similar symptoms. In the cases of the younger women, all had just attained menarch, whereas the older women had all just given birth. The etiologic factor in common turned out to be consumption, ritually, of gingili oil, which is used in a ritual at menarch and after childbirth. Gingili oil used in these cases had been contaminated with tri-cresyl phosphate, a substance known to be responsible for outbreaks of similar polyneuropathy in surrounding areas. It is theorized that the contamination occurred during transport of the oil in containers which had previously been used to store mineral oils."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["810027", "00082543"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: LANCET."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Adolescents", "Adolescents, Female", "Age Factors", "Asia", "Biology", "Central Nervous System", "Central Nervous System Effects--etiology", "Delivery", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Demographic Factors", "Developing Countries", "Epidemiologic Methods", "Health", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Menarche", "Menstruation", "Physiology", "Plants, Medicinal--side effects", "Population", "Population Characteristics", "Postpartum Women", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Outcomes", "Puerperium", "Reproduction", "Research Methodology", "Southern Asia", "Sri Lanka", "Youth"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "6109132", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1981", "Month": "03", "Day": "24"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "06", "Day": "11"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0140-6736", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "1", "Issue": "8211", "PubDate": {"Year": "1981", "Month": "Jan", "Day": "10"}}, "Title": "Lancet (London, England)", "ISOAbbreviation": "Lancet"}, "ArticleTitle": "Toxic polyneuropathy due to gingili oil contaminated with tri-cresyl phosphate affecting adolescent girls in Sri Lanka.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "88", "EndPage": "89", "MedlinePgn": "88-9"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["An outbreak of acute polyneuropathy affected over 20 young females in Sri Lanka during 1977-78.
