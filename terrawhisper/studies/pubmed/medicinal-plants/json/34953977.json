A TTM \"Poh-Pu\" Remedy has been effectively utilized in Thailand for cancer therapy for centuries.", "To investigate anti-inflammatory activity and liver cancer cytotoxicity of Poh-Pu remedy. To determine relationships between the TTM Herbal Flavor theory and the Four Element theory and total flavonoid content and biological activities of Poh-Pu Remedy plant extracts.", "Each plant ingredient was macerated with 95% ethanol. The extracts were investigated for cytotoxic activity against liver cancer using a sulforhodamine B assay, and anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by inhibition of nitric oxide production. The total flavonoid content was determined by an aluminum chloride colorimetric assay. The relationships between the TTM theories, total flavonoid content, and biological activities were evaluated by correlation and cluster analysis.", "Mammea siamensis exerted potent cytotoxicity against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 3.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and low cytotoxicity to the non-cancerous cells (HaCat) with an IC<sub>50</sub> 33.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.40\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (Selective index (SI)\u00a0=\u00a010.6). Tiliacora triandra was selectively cytotoxic to cholangiocarcinama (KKU-M156) cells with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 12.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.92\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (SI\u00a0=\u00a06.4). Curcuma comosa was the most potent anti-inflammatory inhibitor of nitric oxide production with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.34\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Campomanesia aromatica exhibited the highest total flavonoid content of 259.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.21\u00a0mg quercetin equivalent/g. Pungent plants were most prevalent in the TTM remedy.", "Pungent, fragrant, bitter and nauseating plants utilized in TTM cancer remedy were successfully investigated and identified several lead plants and components with cytotoxic and antiinflammatory activity that require further study. The TTM wind element theory appeared to be aligned with cancer-related activity. Biological activity results of taste from herbs related with The TTM Herbal Flavor theory. The extra-oral locations of flavor receptors are a promising target for biological activity of TTM which require further scrutiny and identified several lead plants and components with cytotoxic and antiinflammatory activities that also require further study."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
