It has been reported that Dendrobium contains various bioactive components, mainly including polysaccharides and alkaloids. Previous studies have shown that Dendrobium has pharmacological activities including antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects, as well as immune regulation. Particularly, the anti-aging functions and neuroprotective effects of Dendrobium have been well characterized in a wide array of cell and animal models. In recent years, the effect of Dendrobium on the liver has emerged as a new direction to explore its therapeutic benefits and has received more and more attention. This review is focused on the beneficial effects of Dendrobium on liver toxicity and various liver disorders, which presumably are attributed to a consequence of an array of modes of action due to its multiple bioactive components, and largely lack mechanistic and pharmacokinetic characterization. A particular emphasis is placed on the potential action mechanisms related to Dendrobium's liver protection. Research perspectives in regard to the potential therapeutic application for Dendrobium are also discussed in this review."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
