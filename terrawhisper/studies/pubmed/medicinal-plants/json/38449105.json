However, the low concentration of ginsenosides in plants and the challenges associated with their extraction impede the advancement and application of ginsenosides. Heterologous biosynthesis represents a promising strategy for the targeted production of these natural active compounds. As representative triterpenoids, the biosynthetic pathway of the aglycone skeletons of ginsenosides has been successfully decoded. While the sugar moiety is vital for the structural diversity and pharmacological activity of ginsenosides, the mining of uridine diphosphate-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs) involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis has attracted a lot of attention and made great progress in recent years. In this paper, we summarize the identification and functional study of UGTs responsible for ginsenoside synthesis in both plants, such as <i>Panax ginseng</i> and <i>Gynostemma pentaphyllum</i>, and microorganisms including <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. The UGT-related microbial cell factories for large-scale ginsenoside production are also mentioned. Additionally, we delve into strategies for UGT mining, particularly potential rapid screening or identification methods, providing insights and prospects. This review provides insights into the study of other unknown glycosyltransferases as candidate genetic elements for the heterologous biosynthesis of rare ginsenosides."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Structural Pharmacology & TCM Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Fuzhou, Fujian 350122, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Xiaoxuan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Integrative Medicine, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Fuzhou, Fujian 350122, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ruiqiong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21218, United States."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Weishen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Structural Pharmacology & TCM Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Fuzhou, Fujian 350122, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Innovation and Transformation Center, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Fuzhou, Fujian 350122, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacy Department, People's Hospital Affiliated to Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Fuzhou, Fujian 350004, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Guohong", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2967-6824"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Structural Pharmacology & TCM Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Fuzhou, Fujian 350122, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Shaohua", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2196-1428"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Structural Pharmacology & TCM Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Fuzhou, Fujian 350122, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110016, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Lixia", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Innovation and Transformation Center, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Fuzhou, Fujian 350122, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Yaqian", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Structural Pharmacology & TCM Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Fuzhou, Fujian 350122, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "58-98-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Uridine Diphosphate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Uridine Diphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biosynthetic Pathways"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "56"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38449105", "10.1021/acs.jnatprod.3c00630"]}}]}
