Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex has a wide range of pharmacological effects and has been used to treat conditions such as abdominal distention, vomiting, diarrhea, food accumulation, Qi stagnation, constipation, phlegm and fluid retention and cough resulting from asthma.", "The present paper reviews advances in research relating to the botany, ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex. Prospects for future investigation and application of this herb are also discussed.", "Information on Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex was obtained from published materials, including ancient and modern books; PhD and MSc dissertations; monographs on medicinal plants; the pharmacopoeia of different countries and electronic databases, such as SCI finder, PubMed, Web of Science, ACS, Science Direct, Wiley, Springer, Taylor, AGRIS, Europe PMC, EBSCO host, CNKI, WanFang DATA, J-STAGE and Google Scholar.", "More than 200 chemical compounds have been isolated from Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, including lignans, phenylethanoid glycosides, phenolic glycosides, alkaloids, steroids and essential oils. The plant has been reported to have pharmacological effects on the digestive system, nervous system and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems, as well as antibacterial, anti-tumour, analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects.", "Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex is an essential traditional Chinese medicine with pharmacological activities that mainly affect the digestive system, nervous system and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems. This review summarises its botany, ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology. These information suggest that we should focus on the development of new drugs related to Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, including specific constituents, so that Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex can exert greater therapeutic potential. Meanwhile, it is important to pay attention to the rational use of Magnolia resources, avoiding over-harvesting which could lead to lack of resources. We should also pursue research on Magnolia substitutes and develop resources such as Magnoliae Officinalis Flos and Magnolia Leaf."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
