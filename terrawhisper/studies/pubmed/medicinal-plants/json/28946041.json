Chlorogenic acid (CGA) serves as the quality control marker of honeysuckle for its high content and antipyretic property. In this paper, a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb2E2) against CGA was produced. After optimization, mAb2E2-based indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) was developed. The concentrations of CGA producing 50% inhibition and the calibration range of the icELISA were 0.39 and 0.10-1.51ng/mL, respectively. The icELISA had cross-reactivity with 3,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid (17.53%), and the cross-reactivity levels with other analogs were all below 5%. The average recoveries obtained by standard CGA addition to honeysuckle samples were from 88.4 to 104.8%. The icELISA was applied to CGA detection in different honeysuckle samples and the results were confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. The correlation coefficient between the two assays was 0.97. The proposed icELISA provides a feasible analytical method for highly sensitive and specific, simple, fast, and high-throughput determination of CGA in honeysuckle samples."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
