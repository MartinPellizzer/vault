Historical evidence proves that the plants possess a major resource for the development of novel anti-malarial drugs. In the present study, the bioactivity guided fractionation of the oleogum-resin of Boswellia serrata Roxb. yielded the optimum activity in the ethyl acetate fraction with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.9\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and 26.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL against chloroquine sensitive (NF54) and resistant (K1) strains of Plasmodium falciparum respectively. Further, upon fractionation, the ethyl acetate fraction yielded four major compounds, of which 3-Hydroxy-11-keto-\u03b2-boswellic acid (KBA) was found to be the most potent with IC<sub>50</sub> values 4.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.60\u00a0\u00b5g/mL and 6.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.02\u00a0\u03bcg/mL against sensitive and resistant strains respectively. KBA was found to inhibit heme detoxification pathways, one of the most common therapeutic targets, which probably lead to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) detrimental to P. falciparum. Further, the induced intracellular oxidative stress affected the macromolecules in terms of DNA damage, increased lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation as well as loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. However, it did not exhibit any cytotoxic effect in VERO cells. Under in vivo conditions, KBA exhibited a significant reduction in parasitemia, retarding the development of anaemia, resulting in an enhancement of the mean survival time in Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis (chloroquine-resistant) infected mice. Further, KBA did not exhibit any abnormality in serum biochemistry of animals that underwent acute oral toxicity studies at 2000\u00a0mg/kg body weight."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
