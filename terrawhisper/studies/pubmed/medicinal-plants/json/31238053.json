Ellagic acid (EA) shows abundant pharmacological properties. Therefore, we aimed to determine the mechanism of anti-aging effects of low and high doses of EA.", "Aging model was induced by d-galactose (DG), and the anti-aging effect of EA alone or in the presence of PPAR-\u03b3 antagonist GW9662, and in combination with metformin were evaluated. The activities of ALT, AST, and AChE, the levels of FBS, HbA1c, testosterone and DHEA-SO<sub>4</sub>, MDA, GSH, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and BDNF were measured in serum, liver or brain.", "DG led to increasing in the levels of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, MDA, AChE, AGEs, ALT, AST, FBS, and HbA1c, in which decrease in the levels of body weight, GSH, BDNF, DHEA-SO4 and testosterone. Metformin (300\u202fmg/kg) abrogated the effects of DG-induced aging model. We also found that the low dose of EA (30\u202fmg/kg) decreases the deteriorative effects of DG-induced aging at 10\u202fweeks of treatment only, however, high dose of EA (100\u202fmg/kg) was effective at both 6 and 10\u202fweeks of treatment. The addition of GW9662 completely reversed the effects of the low dose of EA, but not for the high dose, on DG-induced aging model.", "We revealed that daily and oral administration of EA provides anti-aging effects at low dose in a PPAR-\u03b3 receptor-dependent fashion, but not at the high dose."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
