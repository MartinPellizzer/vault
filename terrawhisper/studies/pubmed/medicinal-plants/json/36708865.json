A flavonoid found in citrus fruits modulates cell cycle phases and inhibits the proliferation of hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells by targeting hyaluronidase.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "113638", "MedlinePgn": "113638"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Narirutin is a dietary flavanone found in lemons, oranges, passion fruit, bergamot and grapefruit. It possesses anti-allergic, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective potential, and its enriched fraction suppresses the growth of prostate cancer cells; however, there is currently no information on the chemopreventive potential of narirutin alone against hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and its mode of action. Thus, the chemopreventive possibility of narirutin was investigated in PC-3\u00a0cells by utilising cytotoxicity assays. Further, a mechanism was deduced targeting hyaluronidase, an early-stage diagnosis marker, by cell-free, cell-based and in silico studies. The results indicate that narirutin reduced the viability of PC-3\u00a0cells with the inhibitory concentration range of 66.87-59.80\u00a0\u03bcM. It induced G0/G1 phase arrest with a fold change of 1.12. Besides, it increased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a fold change of 1.34\u00a0at 100\u00a0\u03bcM. Narirutin inhibited hyaluronidase's activity in cell-free (11.17\u00a0\u03bcM) and cell-based assays (67.23\u00a0\u03bcM) and showed a strong binding interaction with hyaluronidase. Finally, the MD simulation analysis supported the idea that narirutin binding enhanced compactness and stability and created a stable complex with hyaluronidase. In addition, ADMET prediction indicates that it is a non-toxic, non-CYPs inhibitor and thus didn't alter the metabolism. The results reveal that narirutin may be a potential chemopreventive agent for hormone-resistant prostate cancer cells in addition to offering data for supporting diet-based nutraceutical agents to prevent prostate cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
