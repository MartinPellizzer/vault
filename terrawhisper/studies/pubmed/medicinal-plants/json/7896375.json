The researcher planned to use the findings to design nutrition education programs. 83.2% of the mothers were illiterate. 80% were of low or middle socioeconomic class. 66.4% worked in agriculture or animal husbandry. Preferred foods during diarrhea were khitchri (52.4%), thuli or daliya (48.5%), banana (37.9%), and chhach/curd (21.6%). Restricted foods included roti (69.7%), milk (47.1%), vegetables, chilies, and hot foods. The major herbal medicines used to cure diarrhea were isabgol ke bhusi mixed with curd (31.3%) and extracts of tea leaves, ajwain, sonth, peepla mul, black pepper, and tulsi leaves (14.4%). Preferred foods during measles were kishmish/munakka (38.5%), khitchri/rabdi of bajra (35.6%), daliya (25%), and cow's milk (23.1%). Restricted foods included roti (62.5%), all dals except moong dal (59.1%), and vegetables (42.8%). The leading herbal medicines used to treat measles were a mixture of nutmeg, mace, clove, tulsi leaves, and kishmish (26.9%) and a mixture of nutmeg, mace, clove, tulsi leaves, and brahmi (25.5%). The mothers believed that herbal medicines save their children's lives. These findings indicate the need to consider beliefs about culturally accepted and restricted foods when designing a nutritional and health education program."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["104635", "00240238"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: INDIAN PEDIATRICS."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Age Factors", "Asia", "Beliefs", "Child", "Culture", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Demographic Factors", "Developing Countries", "Diarrhea--prevention and control", "Diet", "Diseases", "Education", "Health", "Health Education", "Health Services", "India", "Kap Surveys", "Measles--prevention and control", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Nutrition", "Nutrition Programs", "Population", "Population Characteristics", "Primary Health Care", "Research Report", "Sampling Studies", "Southern Asia", "Studies", "Surveys", "Viral Diseases", "Youth"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "7896375", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1995", "Month": "04", "Day": "26"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "17"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0019-6061", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "31", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1994", "Month": "Mar"}}, "Title": "Indian pediatrics", "ISOAbbreviation": "Indian Pediatr"}, "ArticleTitle": "Maternal beliefs and practices regarding the diet and use of herbal medicines during measles and diarrhea in rural areas.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "340", "EndPage": "343", "MedlinePgn": "340-3"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Desert Medicine Research Center (ICMR), Jodhpur."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "M B", "Initials": "MB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian Pediatr", "NlmUniqueID": "2985062R", "ISSNLinking": "0019-6061"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Attitude to Health"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maternal Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Measles"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Mothers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7896375"]}}]}
