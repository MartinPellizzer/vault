This was demonstrated by comparing the antioxidant activities of compounds 1 and 2 with those of the (benzyl)(hydroxybenzyl)tetrahydrofurans 3 and 4, the bis(hydroxybenzyl)tetrahydrofurans 7 and 8, the (benzoyl)(benzyl)tetrahydrofuran 6, and the dibenzoyltetrahydrofuran 9. The activity level of compound 2 was approximately the same potency as that of the tetrahydronaphthalene-tetrahydrofuran 5. These compounds possess either a 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl group or a 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoyl group as the benzyl or benzoyl group. An examination of radical scavenging activity showed differences of activity between diastereomers. To make this comparison possible, compounds 1-9 were synthesized using new synthetic routes for several of these lignans. In this investigation, stereoisomers of the (benzyl)(hydroxybenzyl)tetrahydrofurans 3 and 4 and liovils 7 and 8 were synthesized for the first time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Agriculture, Ehime University, Tarumi 3-5-7, Matsuyama, Ehime 790-8566, Japan. syamauch@agr.ehime-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamauchi", "ForeName": "Satoshi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hayashi", "ForeName": "Yoshimasa", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakashima", "ForeName": "Yuki", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kirikihira", "ForeName": "Takuya", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "Kazuki", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Masuda", "ForeName": "Toshiya", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzene Derivatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Furans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "580-72-3", "NameOfSubstance": "matairesinol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzene Derivatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Furans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lignans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16252908", "10.1021/np050089s"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
