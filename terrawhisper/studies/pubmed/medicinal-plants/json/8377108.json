The blood of the patient was taken at 8.5 and 15.5 h after taking about 50 ginkgo albumens. After deproteinization of the serum, the supernatant was pretreated with Sep-pak C18 cartridge and was applied to HPLC. HPLC was performed with a Hibar LiChrosorb RP-18 (4.0 mm i.d. x 250 mm, 7 microns) using a fluorescence detector (wave length of excitation and fluorescence; 290 and 400 nm, respectively). The serum MPN level was determined by the absolute calibration method. The determination limit of MPN in the serum was 0.05 micrograms/ml. The serum MPN concentration was 0.09 micrograms/ml at 8.5 h after taking ginkgo seeds, and was less than the determination limit of MPN (0.05 micrograms/ml) at 15.5 h. MPN, isolated from the seed of Ginkgo biloba L., is responsible for \"gin-nan food poisoning,\" and its cardinal symptoms are mainly tonic and/or clonic convulsions and loss of consciousness. Infants are particularly vulnerable. This method may be available for proving the gin-nan food poisoning, chemically."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Higashi Nippon Gakuen University, Hokkaido, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yagi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wada", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sakata", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kokubo", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Haga", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1464-33-1", "NameOfSubstance": "4-methoxymethylpyridoxine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KV2JZ1BI6Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridoxine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Pyridoxine"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seizures"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8377108", "10.1248/yakushi1947.113.8_596"]}}]}
