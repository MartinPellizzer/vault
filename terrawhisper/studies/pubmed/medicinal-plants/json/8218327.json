To characterize the malate transport system at the vacuolar membrane of CAM plants, tonoplast vesicles were prepared from leaf mesophyll cells of the crassulacean plant Kalancho\u00eb daigremontiana. Dicarboxylate uptake, assayed by a membrane-filtration method using [14C]malate or [14C]succinate, displayed saturation kinetics with apparent Km values of 4.0 mM (malate) and 1.8 mM (succinate); competition experiments indicated that both anions were transported by the same system. Dicarboxylate uptake was stimulated severalfold by activation of the tonoplast H(+)-ATPase or H(+)-PPiase, an effect inhibitable by ionophore. Passive (non-energized) dicarboxylate uptake was sensitive to the sulphydryl reagents N-ethylmaleimide and p-chloromercuribenzene sulphonate, as well as to a range of protein modifiers. In particular, inhibition by pyridoxal phosphate was completely substrate-protectable, and that by phenylglyoxal partially so, thus implicating at least one lysine residue and perhaps also an arginine residue in the substrate-recognition site of the transport protein. The involvement of one or more critical lysine residue was supported by analysis of the initial phase of inhibition by pyridoxal phosphate: this showed pseudo-first-order kinetics with a reaction order of 1.03 +/- 0.13 and a Kd for substrate protection close to the apparent Km for dicarboxylate uptake."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford, UK."}], "LastName": "Bettey", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biochim Biophys Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0217513", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Affinity Labels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dicarboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Malates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Succinates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfhydryl Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5V5IOJ8338", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridoxal Phosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AB6MNQ6J6L", "NameOfSubstance": "Succinic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Affinity Labels"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dicarboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Malates"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pyridoxal Phosphate"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Succinates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Succinic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfhydryl Reagents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8218327", "10.1016/0005-2736(93)90258-2", "0005-2736(93)90258-2"]}}]}
