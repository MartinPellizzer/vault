Brain regions studied were cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum and spinal cord. Parameters assessed were lipid peroxidation, oxygen consumption, and lipofuscin accumulation. The endogenous lipid peroxide was found to be increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the 32-month-old animals. Neuronal lipofuscin accumulation in the neurons of cerebral motor cortex, cerebellum and cervical spinal cord was increased (P < 0.05) in the older animals. Oxygen consumption was found to be decreased significantly(P < 0.05) in the 32-month old guinea pigs. Treatment with MAK at a dose of 500 mg/kg body weight daily for two months reduced the lipid peroxidation and lipofuscin pigment accumulation significantly in brain regions and it also helped in restoring the normal oxygen consumption in the older animals. This indicates antioxidant properties of MAK."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Nutritional Histopathology, Kurukshetra University, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vohra", "ForeName": "B P", "Initials": "BP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "S P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kansal", "ForeName": "V K", "Initials": "VK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipofuscin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipofuscin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11491581"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
