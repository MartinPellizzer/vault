AP-M significantly prolonged the life span of S180-, Meth-A fibrosarcoma- and MM-2 mammary carcinoma-bearing mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.) pre- or postmedication. AP-M also inhibited the growth of S-180 solid type tumor. On the other hand, the prolongation of life span induced by AP-M on S-180 ascites type tumor-bearing mice was markedly minimized or abolished by the pretreatment of cyclophosphamide. AP-M showed considerably strong cytotoxicity on MM-2 cells in vitro, but the effect was diminished to one-tenth by the addition of serum to the culture. Against the host animals, the peripheral white blood cells in mice were significantly increased from 2 to 5 days after the i.p. injection of AP-M. On 4th day after the injection of AP-M, the peritoneal exudate cells which possessed the cytotoxic activity on MM-2 cells in vitro were also increased to about 5-fold those in the non-treated control. The spleen of the mice was enlarged, and the spleen cells possessed the capacity to uptake 3H-thymidine. However, AP-M did not show direct migration activity like other mitogens against spleen cells from non-treated mice. These results indicate that the roots of Agrimonia pilosa contain some antitumor constituents, and possible mechanisms of the antitumor activity may be some host-mediated actions and direct cytotoxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Koshiura", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miyamoto", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ikeya", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Taguchi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Jpn J Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "2983305R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-5198"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VC2W18DGKR", "NameOfSubstance": "Thymidine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ascitic Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C3H"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Transplantation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thymidine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4040585", "10.1254/jjp.38.9"]}}]}
