One promising approach is the consumption of technologically processed functional foods enriched/fortified with (poly)phenols. The current systematic review aimed to evaluate the human clinical trials evidence on the effect of intake of these foods on reducing the most common cardiometabolic risk factors. 12 randomized controlled studies were included in the systematic review, with varying food intake amounts (27-360\u2009g/day) and (poly)phenol doses (32.5-850\u2009mg/day). These interventions included consumption of functional bakery goods, cereal bars, pasta, chocolate, and yogurt, with supplementation periods spanning from 2 to 52 wk. Several foods, such as green tea extract-fortified rye bread and olive fruit (poly)phenol-fortified yogurt, significantly lowered blood pressure. Flavonoid-enriched chocolate, hydroxytyrosol-fortified bread, and other products influenced glucose metabolism. Additionally, various functional foods were associated with improved blood lipid levels. While these results indicate the health advantages of consuming technologically processed functional foods enriched/fortified with (poly)phenols, caution is warranted due to the scarcity and limitations of existing studies. Further research is needed to confirm and expand upon these results in the prevention and management of cardiometabolic risk factors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2744-8270"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, \"Iuliu Ha\u021bieganu\" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."}], "LastName": "Frumuzachi", "ForeName": "Oleg", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8055-9215"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, \"George Emil Palade\" University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences and Technology of T\u00e2rgu Mures, T\u00e2rgu Mures, Romania."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmacy, \"George Emil Palade\" University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences and Technology of T\u00e2rgu Mures, T\u00e2rgu Mures, Romania."}], "LastName": "Babot\u0103", "ForeName": "Mihai", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5029-5060"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bromatology, Hygiene, Nutrition, \"Iuliu Hatieganu\" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."}], "LastName": "Miere", "ForeName": "Doina", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5848-8457"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, \"Iuliu Ha\u021bieganu\" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, \"George Emil Palade\" University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences and Technology of T\u00e2rgu Mures, T\u00e2rgu Mures, Romania."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Chromatography, Institute of Advanced Horticulture Research of Transylvania, University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."}], "LastName": "Mocan", "ForeName": "Andrei", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2207-8998"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, \"Iuliu Ha\u021bieganu\" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."}], "LastName": "Cri\u0219an", "ForeName": "Gianina", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38214689", "10.1080/10408398.2023.2286475"]}}]}
