The ideal sterilization method was that young petiole of T. farfara was sterilized with 75% ethanol for 30 s, and then transferred to saturated bleaching power supernatant for 15 min. The suitable medium for callus induction was MS+6-BA 3.0 mg\u2022L\u207b\u00b9+2,4-D 2.0 mg\u2022L\u207b\u00b9 with 96.2% induction rate. The seedlings had better differentiation with 91% differentiation rate and 8.26 buds on the medium containing MS+ZT 2.0 mg\u2022L\u207b\u00b9+NAA 0.3 mg\u2022L\u207b\u00b9. The preferred enrichment medium of adventitious bud was MS+KT 1.0 mg\u2022L\u207b\u00b9+IBA 0.3 mg\u2022L\u207b\u00b9 with 11.81 enrichment times and 4.9 cm seedling height. The rooting medium included 1/2MS+IBA 0.2 mg\u2022L\u207b\u00b9 with the average number of rooting was 5.86 and the rooting rate was above 95.22%. The container seedlings can grow well and the survival rate was more than 90% when they were transplanted on the medium added with river sand and organic fertilizer with the ratio of 3\u22361. The field experiments indicated that significant differences in increment and yield of pollen grains among the tissue-culture, cultivation and wild type of T. farfara under the same cultivation conditions. The cultivated plants were relatively high on the increment and yield of pollen grains. The active ingredient content of the tissue culture and the wild materials was basically the same."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu Forestry Professional Technology College, Tianshui 741020, China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Ji-Wen", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu Forestry Professional Technology College, Tianshui 741020, China."}], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu Forestry Professional Technology College, Tianshui 741020, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao-Ling", "Initials": "XL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regeneration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Tussilago"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29243424", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0156"]}}]}
