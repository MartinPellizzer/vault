Analgesic effects of opioids, such as morphine and U-50,488H, were blocked by ginseng in a non-opioid dependent manner. Furthermore, ginseng inhibited the tolerance to and dependence on morphine, and prevented the suppressive effect on the development of morphine tolerance caused by co-exposure to foot-shock stress, but not psychological stress. On the other hand, behavioral sensitization (reverse tolerance to ambulation-accelerating effect) to morphine, methamphetamine (MAP) and cocaine was also inhibited by ginseng. Interestingly, ginseng also inhibited the appearance of the recurrent phenomenon (reappearance of the sensitized state was observed at the time of readministration of MAP and cocaine even after a 30-day discontinuation of drug administration) of the effect of MAP and cocaine. The conditioned place preference of MAP and cocaine was completely blocked by ginseng. These findings provide evidence that ginseng may be useful clinically for the prevention of abuse and dependence of opioids and psychostimulants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Showa University, 1-5-8 Hatanodai, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo 142-8555, Japan. stoku@pharm.showa-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tokuyama", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0420550", "ISSNLinking": "0015-5691"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics, Opioid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Psychotropic Drugs"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics, Opioid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Conditioning, Psychological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Psychotropic Drugs"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Substance-Related Disorders"}], "NumberOfReferences": "42"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11288489", "10.1254/fpj.117.195"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
