In that respect, the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) of the 252Cf emission has been determined for a continuous low dose rate irradiation. The biological system is growth inhibition in Vicia faba bean roots. A new Vicia faba \"BelB\" strain has been used, which better tolerates long periods (up to about 10 hours) of anoxia. In a first series of experiments, for a 252Cf (Dn + gamma) dose rate of 0.11 Gy . h-1, an OER of 1.4 +/- 0.1 was observed (the gamma contribution of D gamma to the total absorbed dose Dn + gamma was 0.35 at the position of the root tips). In a second series of experiments, in somewhat different geometrical conditions with a 252Cf (Dn + gamma) dose rate of 0.13 Gy . h-1, an OER of 1.5 +/- 0.1 was observed (D gamma/Dn + gamma = 0.42). The OER values observed for similar irradiation times, with iridium-192 gamma-rays, were 2.3 +/- 0.2 and 2.6 +/- 0.1 respectively, which leads to therapeutic gain factors (GF) of 1.6 and 1.7 respectively. These GF values are slightly lower than those previously obtained (GF = 1.8) on the same system, with d(50)-Be, p(75)-Be and 15 MeV neutron beams."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wambersie", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Van Dam", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Octave-Prignot", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dutreix", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Effet oxyg\u00e8ne (OER) et gain th\u00e9rapeutique (GF) pour une irradiation \u00e0 faible d\u00e9bit par le californium-252."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "C R Seances Soc Biol Fil", "NlmUniqueID": "7505439", "ISSNLinking": "0037-9026"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "44448S9773", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "975X05H15A", "NameOfSubstance": "Californium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Californium"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Iridium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neutrons"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Dosage"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Radioisotopes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6215110"]}}]}
