The aerial parts have a wide folk reputation for antisyphilitic, sudorific, antipyretic, laxative and diuretic activity, and are reported to be useful in preparing post partum baths and to enhance wound healing. Its four most studied alkaloids are vertine, lyfoline, lythrine and nesodine. Structural relationships of the Heimia alkaloids and certain synthetic 4-arylquinolizidines are reviewed here. Preliminary clinical evaluation indicates that vertine and lythrine given orally appear to lack the psychodysleptic activity that has been touted for native brews said to incorporate H. salicifolia. Most of the animal studies discussed here have focused on the ataractic, antiinflammatory and antispasmodic potential of vertine and on the hydrodiuretic potential of lythrine and decine, a structurally related alkaloid found in Decodon verticillatus. The ataractic activity of vertine does not appear to be dependent on the depletion or blockade of catecholamines, while its antiinflammatory capacity seen in both exudative and immunologic systems seems to be dependent in part on an intact pituitary-adrenal system and in part on inhibition of prostaglandin synthase. The antisplasmodic activity of vertine has been demonstrated on many isolated tissues using different agonists, but appears to be largely musculotropic in nature. Only lythrine and decinine have been shown to be true hydrodiuretics and may prove to be useful in treating Addison's disease and general nephrosis. A number of synthetic 4-arylquinolizidines and related compounds appear to possess antiinflammatory potential."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, University of the Pacific, Stockton, CA 95211."}], "LastName": "Malone", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rother", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Central America"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South America"}], "NumberOfReferences": "99"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7934084", "10.1016/0378-8741(94)90080-9", "0378-8741(94)90080-9"]}}]}
