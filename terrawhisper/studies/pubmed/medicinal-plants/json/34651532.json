Coastal saline-soil plots planted with <i>S. aizoon</i> and <i>T. mongolicum</i> and bare plots were used to explore their effects on the microbial community structure of coastal saline soil. The diversity and function of soil bacterial communities were analyzed using Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that the \u03b1-diversity of soil bacterial communities were higher in planted than in bare plots, in the following order: <i>T. mongolicum</i> plot > <i>S. aizoon</i> plot\u2009>\u2009bare plot. The soil bacterial communities also changed after planting <i>S. aizoon</i> and <i>T. mongolicum</i>. The LDA effect size analysis showed that there were 37 indicator species among the three plot types. Correlation analysis of environmental factors showed that EC, AP, and OM were the main factors influencing bacterial community composition in this coastal saline soil. The PICRUSt functional prediction showed that the numbers of metabolic functions of bacterial communities were in the following order: <i>T. mongolicum</i> plot > <i>S. aizoon</i> plot\u2009>\u2009bare plot.
