R\u00fcdiger, the then pharmacist in Kralupy, and with great participation of PhMr. K. Sch\u00fcrer, the then owner of a firm furnishing pharmacies, participated in the Jubilee Country's Exhibition from May 15 to October 18, 1891 in Prague. Sixteen Czech pharmacists exhibited the products of their laboratories and manufacturing plants, galenical and chemical preparations and the first \"specialities of pharmacies\", personal and home medicine-cases and various adjusting and auxiliary material (such as bottles and ointment jars), \"medicinal wafers\" and the pertinent devices for their closing (PhMr. Fr. Sevc\u00edk from Prague). K. Sch\u00fcrer exhibited a complete equipment of a modern pharmacy with glass and porcelain drug jars and various pharmaceutical utensils. It was for the first time that pharmaceutical historical material, documentary and literary items were exhibited for the general public. The top exhibit was the Prague baroque pharmacy \"The Golden Crown\", which was donated to the National Museum in Prague when the exhibition was closed. The exhibition was put under a boycott by some German industrialists and the German pharmacists from Bohemia ostentatiously rejected any participation. The exhibition and its pharmaceutical part thus resulted in a distinguished achievement of Czech effort and work."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hanzl\u00edcek", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Jubilejn\u00ed zemsk\u00e1 v\u00fdstava r. 1891 a Cesk\u00e9 l\u00e9k\u00e1rnictvo."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Czech Republic", "MedlineTA": "Cesk Farm", "NlmUniqueID": "0372720", "ISSNLinking": "0009-0530"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anniversaries and Special Events"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Czechoslovakia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exhibitions as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History of Pharmacy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1893411"]}}]}
