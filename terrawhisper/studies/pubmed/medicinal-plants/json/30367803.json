The nephroprotective properties of methanol stem bark extract of Abrus precatorius against gentamicin-induced renal damage in rats was evaluated in this study. Methods Thirty male Wistar rats were divided into five equal groups. Group A was the negative control group while B was the positive control group which received gentamicin 100 mg/kg intra-peritoneally for 6 days. Group C were pretreated with 100 mg/kg extract for the 3 days and then concurrently with gentamicin 100 mg/kg for 3 days and group D were pretreated with 200 mg/kg extract for 3 days and then concurrently with gentamicin 100 mg/kg for 3 days. Group E received gentamicin intraperitoneally for 6 days followed by administration of 200 mg/kg of the extract for 3 days. Blood samples, kidneys and kidney homogenates were collected for haematological, biochemical, histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Results The results showed that no significant haematological changes were noted. The groups treated with extract exhibited significant increase in body weight gain. While group B significantly exhibited focal areas of inflammation, fatty degeneration, congestion of vessels, tubular necrosis and glomerular atrophy, the lesions were mild with the treated groups. Treated groups exhibited a dose dependent significant decrease in serum creatinine, urea, XO, NO and Myeloperoxidase, AOPP, Protein carbonyl, H2O2 generated and MDA levels when compared with group B. There were significant dose dependent improvements in SOD, GST, GSH, Protein thiol, and non-protein thiol levels in the treated groups when compared with group B. In immunohistochemistry, Group B exhibited over expression of CRP and NF-\u03baB levels, and marked reduction in expression of Bcl-2 while the reverse was seen in the groups treated with methanol extracts of Abrus precatorius. Conclusion The methanol extract of Abrus precatorius plays a vital role against gentamicin induced renal damage by reducing levels of renal markers of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis, enhancing enzymatic and non enzymatic renal antioxidant system, alongside an increase in Bcl-2 and a decrease in NF-\u03baB and CRP expressions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Falayi", "ForeName": "Olufunke Olubunmi", "Initials": "OO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Physiology and Biochemistry, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Oyagbemi", "ForeName": "Ademola Adetokunbo", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Omobowale", "ForeName": "Temidayo Olutayo", "Initials": "TO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Faculty of Science, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ayodele", "ForeName": "Emmanuel Abiodun", "Initials": "EA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Adedapo", "ForeName": "Aduragbenro Deborah", "Initials": "AD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Interdisciplinary Sciences, College of Science, Technology and Engineering, Texas Southern University, 3100 Cleburne Avenue, Houston, TX 77004, USA."}], "LastName": "Yakubu", "ForeName": "Momoh Audu", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Adedapo", "ForeName": "Adeolu Alex", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Complement Integr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101313855", "ISSNLinking": "1553-3840"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gentamicins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AYI8EX34EU", "NameOfSubstance": "Creatinine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Abrus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Creatinine"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gentamicins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "genetics", "metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Bark"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30367803", "10.1515/jcim-2017-0176", "/j/jcim.ahead-of-print/jcim-2017-0176/jcim-2017-0176.xml"]}}]}
