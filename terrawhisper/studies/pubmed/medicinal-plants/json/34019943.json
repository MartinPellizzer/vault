This study investigated the chemical interactions between BGM and the enzyme CYP2C9. BGM exhibited time-, concentration-, and NADPH-dependent inhibition of CYP2C9. Co-incubation with diclofenac, a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C9, attenuated the time-dependent enzyme inhibition. Exhaustive dialysis did not restore enzyme activity post-inhibition. Glutathione (GSH) and catalase/superoxide dismutase failed to reverse BGM-induced CYP2C9 inactivation. A GSH trapping study suggested that BGM was metabolized to an epoxide and/or \u03b3-ketoenal that may have been responsible for the enzyme inactivation. In conclusion, BGM can be characterized as a mechanism-based inactivator of CYP2C9 acting via the formation of an epoxide and/or \u03b3-ketoenal."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
