Herbal medicines have been frequently used for preventing and treating obesity in many countries, but in most cases, the key anti-obesity constituents in herbs and their anti-obesity mechanisms are poorly understood. This study demonstrated a case study for uncovering the anti-obesity constituents in an anti-obesity herbal medicine (Ginkgo biloba extract) and deciphering their synergistic effects via targeting human pancreatic lipase (hPL). Following screening the anti-hPL effects of eighty herbal medicines, Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE50) was found with the most potent anti-hPL activity. Global chemical profiling of herbal constituents coupling with hPL inhibition assay revealed that the bioflavonoids and several flavonoids in GBE50 were key anti-hPL constituents. Among all tested thirty-eight constituents, sciadopitysin, bilobetin, quercetin, isoginkgetin, and ginkgetin showed potent anti-hPL effects (IC<sub>50</sub> values <2.5\u00a0\u03bcM). Inhibition kinetic analyses suggested that sciadopitysin, bilobetin, quercetin, isoginkgetin, and ginkgetin acted as non-competitive inhibitors of hPL, with the K<sub>i</sub> values were <2\u00a0\u03bcM. Docking simulations revealed that four bioflavonoids (sciadopitysin, bilobetin, isoginkgetin, and ginkgetin) could tightly bind on hPL at cavity 2, which it is different from the binding cavity of quercetin on hPL. Further investigations demonstrated that the combinations of quercetin and one bioflavonoid-type hPL inhibitor (sciadopitysin or bilobetin) showed synergistic anti-hPL effects, suggesting that the multi-components in GBE50 may generate more potent anti-hPL effect. Collectively, our findings uncovered the anti-obesity constituents in GBE50, and explored their anti-hPL mechanisms as well as synergistic effects at molecular levels, which will be very helpful for further understanding the anti-obesity mechanisms of Ginkgo biloba."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
