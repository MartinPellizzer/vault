In the present study, the effect of different concentrations of a single dose of aqueous extracts of garlic and onion were evaluated on serum thromboxane-B(2)synthesis in rabbits. Different concentrations of garlic and onion were administered as single doses in the ear vein of rabbits. Rabbits were bled before and at different intervals after the infusion of garlic or onion extracts. Venous blood was collected and allowed to clot at 37 degrees C for 1 h. Thromboxane-B(2)level was measured in the serum by radioimmunoassay. It was observed that garlic inhibits the thrombin-induced platelet synthesis of TXB(2)in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Maximum inhibition of TXB(2)occurred between 0.5 h and 6 h at 25 and 100 mg kg(-1)garlic. At 24 h post-garlic infusion TXB(2)inhibition was reduced to 15% of the control and TXB(2)levels were comparable to that of the control values at 72 h pots-garlic infusion. Infusion of 100 mg kg(-1)onion extract did not elicit any inhibitory effect on TXB(2)synthesis in the serum of rabbit during the treatment period. The rapid recovery of platelet cyclooxygenase activity after infusion of a single dose of garlic suggests that garlic should be taken more frequently in order to achieve beneficial effects in the prevention of thrombosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Science, Kuwait University, Safat, Kuwait."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thomson", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mustafa", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Scotland", "MedlineTA": "Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids", "NlmUniqueID": "8802730", "ISSNLinking": "0952-3278"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antithrombins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "54397-85-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Thromboxane B2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antithrombins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Coagulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Platelets"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Onions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radioimmunoassay"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Thrombosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Thromboxane B2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11049697", "10.1054/plef.2000.0212", "S0952-3278(00)90212-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
