The average counts of the LAB in the 20 winter samples and the 20 summer samples were 7.4 and 8.7 log CFU/g, respectively. The averages of the Enterobacteriaceae counts were 5.1 and 6.6 log CFU/g, respectively, and the 11 species isolated belonged to the genera Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Escherichia and Klebsiella. The average yeast counts in winter and summer samples were 3 and 3.2 log CFU/g, respectively, and the 5 species isolated were in the genera Saccharomyces, Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula and Candida. Although Salmonella was not isolated from any sample and the Staphylococcus aureus count in all samples was < 1 log CFU/g, microbial hazards could be associated with the high Enterobacteriaceae counts and the presence of Escherichia coli. Total alkaloid concentration in 30% of the samples examined was higher than 0.02%, thus making the seeds a potential chemical hazard. Boiling the turmus directly before consumption and discarding the seeds with a bitter taste may help in avoiding some of the microbial and chemical hazards which could be associated with turmus consumption."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition and Food Technology, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan."}], "LastName": "Yamani", "ForeName": "M I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tayeh", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Salhab", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "451W47IQ8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Enterobacteriaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Lactobacillaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Chloride"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9829189", "10.4315/0362-028x-61.11.1480", "S0362-028X(22)01738-0"]}}]}
