Intraperitoneal administration of ginseng total saponin (GTS, 200 mg/kg of body weight) prior to and during chronic administration of methamphetamine inhibited the development of reverse tolerance. Dopamine receptor supersensitivity was also developed in reverse tolerant mice which had received the same methamphetamine. The development of dopamine receptor supersensitivity was evidenced by the enhanced hypothermic response to apomorphine (1 mg/kg) and the enhanced ambulatory activity of apomorphine (4 mg/kg). GTS also prevented the development of dopamine receptor supersensitivity induced by the chronic administration of methamphetamine. These results show that GTS may be useful for the prevention of and therapy for the adverse action of methamphetamine. It is concluded that the development of reverse tolerance to methamphetamine may be associated with the enhanced dopamine receptor supersensitivity since both phenomena were blocked by GTS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rheu", "ForeName": "H M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "D H", "Initials": "DH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "K W", "Initials": "KW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Dopamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "44RAL3456C", "NameOfSubstance": "Methamphetamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Methamphetamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Dopamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7700985", "10.1055/s-2006-957991"]}}]}
