Extract efficacy was evaluated using the agar well diffusion assay against four filamentous fungi and two yeasts monitored by standard antifungal disks. The results showed that all but, in particular, ethanol and chloroform of the examined plant extracts reveal variable degree of bioactivity against at least two of the tested microbes. The highest ethanol extract activity was exhibited by Cressa cretica. L. against Penicillium citrinum. Thom (32.2 mm) followed by Candida albicans. (C. P. Robin) Berkhout (25.7 mm). The diffusable metabolites of Heliotropium curassavicum. also demonstrated marked inhibitory effect against the same microorganisms. Chloroform extract of Emex spinosa. Campd. displayed an elevated potency against Alternaria alternata. (Fries) Keissler (27.9 mm) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. (27.5 mm). Zone of inhibition against other fungi varied from 19.9 mm to 25.9 mm, indicating a novel class of metabolite. However, the highest growth inhibition was encountered with Fagonia indica. Burm f. against Penicillium citrinum. (29.3 mm). With the exception of chloroform extracts from cultivated soils, various extracts of plants randomly collected from saline-affected soils exhibited higher fungal radius inhibition than plants from cultivated soils. The significance of these results in relation to ethnobotanical data are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biology."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mandeel", "ForeName": "Qaher", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Chemistry, College of Science, University of Bahrain, Isa Town Campus, Kingdom of Bahrain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taha", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812552", "ISSNLinking": "1388-0209"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28925840", "10.1080/13880200590951766"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
