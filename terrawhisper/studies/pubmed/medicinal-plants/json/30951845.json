Ethnopharmacological evidence suggests that plants of the genus Canarium cure a variety of inflammatory diseases.", "The pharmacological mechanisms of C. subulatum Guillaumin remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate inflammatory mechanisms and target molecules using C. subulatum Guillaumin methanol extract (Cs-ME) in inflammatory reactions managed by macrophages.", "To identify the anti-inflammatory activities of Cs-ME, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages and a murine HCl/EtOH-induced gastritis model were chosen. The luciferase reporter gene assay, Western blot analysis, overexpression strategy, and the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) were employed to investigate the molecular mechanisms and target enzymes of Cs-ME. The active ingredients of this extract were also determined by HPLC.", "Released levels of nitric oxide (NO) and mRNA expression levels of iNOS and IL-6 were downregulated by Cs-ME without exhibiting cytotoxicity. This extract inhibited MyD88-induced promoter activity and the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB. Moreover, we found that Cs-ME reduced the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB upstream signaling molecules including I\u03baB\u03b1, IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, Src, and Syk in LPS-stimulated macrophage-like RAW264.7\u202fcells. The results of Western blot and CETSA confirmed that Src and Syk are anti-inflammatory targets of Cs-ME. In addition, orally injected Cs-ME alleviated HCl/EtOH-induced gastric ulcers in mice. HPLC analysis indicated that quercetin, luteolin, and kaempferol are major active components of this extract with anti-inflammatory activity.", "Cs-ME exhibits anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo by targeting Src and Syk in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Consequently, Cs-ME could be developed as an anti-inflammatory herbal medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
