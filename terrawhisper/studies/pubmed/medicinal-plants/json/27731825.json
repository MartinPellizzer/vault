Recently natural products are studied worldwide, as safer alternatives, which are not duly supported with scientifically proved data. Melia azedarach (Bakayan, China berry tree) is medium sized tree belonging to family Meliaceae. Traditional use of plant is as anthelmintic, antilithic and diuretic. Topical application of oil for cramps and rheumatism is beneficial. Methanolic extract of flowers (BFM), twigs (BTM) and roots (BKB) were the test drugs to study different activities on NMRI mice. This is the first report regarding CNS activity of Melia flowers. Significant anxiolytic activity (p=0.000) of extract of flowers (BFM) and of roots (BKB) (p=0.002) was determined by \"elevated plus maze\" and \"Light and dark activity box\". Antidepressant activity was seen by BFM (p=0.000) in \"forced swim test\". Diazepam and Imipramine were used as positive controls respectively. In conclusion flower extract have shown very powerful anxiolytic and anti-depressant activity and cytotoxic potential of twigs cannot be ruled out."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Hamdard University, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ishaq", "ForeName": "Humera", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Azadirachta"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maze Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Bark"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swimming"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27731825"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
