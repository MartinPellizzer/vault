The concentrations of curcumol were determined and pharmacokinetics was calculated. A good linearity was obtained from 0.25 to 100 ng x mL(-1) in plasma. The relative recoveries were from 91.33% to 103.17%, and the absolute recoveries were from 31.61% to 37.20%. The intra-day and inter-day variances (RSD) were < 15%. The main pharmacokinetic parameters of curcumol after intravenous injection of 7.5, 10 and 12.5 mg x kg(-1) zedoary turmeric oil fat emulsion were as follows, T1/2 : (2.0 +/- 0.4), (1.7 +/- 0.2) and (2.3 +/- 0.8) h, AUC(0-infinity): (15.1 +/- 2.7), (18.3 +/- 2.0) and (29.5 +/- 4.0) ng x mL(-1) x h; MRT: (0.9 +/- 0.1), (0.8 +/- 0.2) and (0.8 +/- 0.1) h, CL: (21.9 +/- 4.0), (24.9 +/- 6.0) and (18.4 +/- 1.2) L x h(-1) x kg; Vd : (65.4 +/- 26.5), (62.0 +/- 13.4) and (61.2 +/- 19.8) L x kg(-1), respectively. The developed method was rapid, highly sensitive and specific and could be used in curcumol pharmacokinetic studies in vivo. A three-compartment model was best fit to the plasma concentration--time curves obtained in Beagle dogs and the plasma AUC was increased proportionally with doses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ben-Jie", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Heng-Li", "Initials": "HL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao-Li", "Initials": "XL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Chun-Min", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Rui-Chen", "Initials": "RC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "856YO1Z64F", "NameOfSubstance": "turmeric extract"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9190RTN07X", "NameOfSubstance": "curcumol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Area Under Curve"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Curcuma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18050741"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
