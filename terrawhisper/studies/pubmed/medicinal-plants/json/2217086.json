The results suggested both extrusion and pressure cooking with lime to be equally effective in improving the protein quality of Canavalia and superior to pressure cooking alone and roasting, the latter effective possibly in destroying the antiphysiological factors in Canavalia but possibly also damaging its protein quality. The individual effects of roasting, cooking with different levels of calcium hydroxide, and with water under pressure at different times on the protein quality of Canavalia were also studied. These indicated a beneficial effect of calcium hydroxide added at a level of 0.45% by weight of seed, for 30 minutes under pressure. Cooking in water under pressure for 30 minutes with and without lime added was slightly better than cooking for longer periods of time. Roasting was also effective in improving the quality of Canavalia particularly when the T was adjusted at 170 degrees C, and roasting conducted for 15 minutes. A significant improvement in the protein quality of processed Canavalia was obtained by methionine supplementation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Agriculture and Food Science, Institute of Nutrition of Central America and Panama (INCAP), Guatemala."}], "LastName": "Bressani", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sosa", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PF5DZW74VN", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Hydroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Hydroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1982 Jan 25;257(2):832-8", "ArticleIdList": ["6274867"]}, {"Citation": "Br J Nutr. 1963;17:69-78", "ArticleIdList": ["14041133"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1953 May;202(1):91-6", "ArticleIdList": ["13061435"]}, {"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 1974 Mar-Apr;22(2):309-12", "ArticleIdList": ["4840580"]}, {"Citation": "Q Rev Biol. 1977 Jun;52(2):155-78", "ArticleIdList": ["331385"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2217086", "10.1007/BF01104144"]}}]}
