Several studies have found that treatment with statins may decrease the progress of AAA and the risk of rupture by suppressing the inflammatory mediators, decreasing oxidative stress, and inhibiting mechanisms involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Moreover, some studies have reported that prehospital therapy with statins can decrease mortality after surgery. The novelty of this paper is that different studies including those performed in humans and animals were reviewed and the potential mechanisms by which statins can have an effect on AAA were summarized. Overall, the evidence suggested an association between treatment with statins and improvement of AAA."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.
