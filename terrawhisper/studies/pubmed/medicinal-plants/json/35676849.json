Several medicinal plants and their components are being researched and explored for their possible therapeutic contribution to CNS disorders. Thymoquinone (TQ) is one such molecule. Thymoquinone, one of the constituents of Plant Nigella Sativa, is effective against several neurodegenerative diseases like, Alzheimer's, Depression, Encephalomyelitis, Epilepsy, Ischemia, Parkinson's, and Traumatic. This review article presents the neuropharmacological potential of TQ's, their challenges, and delivery prospects, explicitly focusing on neurological disorders along with their chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity. Since TQ has some pharmacokinetic challenges, scientists have focused on novel formulations and delivery systems to enhance bioavailability and ultimately increase its therapeutic value. In the present work, the role of nanotechnology in neurodegenerative disease and how it improves the bioavailability and delivery of a drug to the site of action has been discussed. There are a few limitations to developing novel drug formulations, including solubility, pH, and compatibility of nanomaterials. Since here we are targeting CNS disorders, the bloodbrain barrier (BBB) becomes an additional challenge. Hence, the review summarized the novel aspects of delivery and biocompatible nanoparticles-based approaches for targeted drug delivery into CNS, enhancing TQ bioavailability and its neurotherapeutic effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, School of Pharmaceutical Education & Research, Jamia Hamdard University, New Delhi-110062, India."}], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Rishabh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, 110062, India."}], "LastName": "Sartaj", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, 110062, India."}], "LastName": "Qizilbash", "ForeName": "Farheen Fatima", "Initials": "FF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy Practice, College of Pharmacy, Al Maarefa University, Ad Diriyah, Riyadh 13713, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ghoneim", "ForeName": "Mohammed M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alshehri", "ForeName": "Sultan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Imam", "ForeName": "Syed Sarim", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Maulana Azad University, Village Bujhawar, Tehsil Luni, Jodhpur, 342802, Rajasthan, India."}], "LastName": "Kala", "ForeName": "Chandra", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Jazan University, Jazan, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alam", "ForeName": "Md Shamsher", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Basic Health Science, Preparatory Year, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, 11671, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Gilani", "ForeName": "Sadaf Jamal", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Maulana Azad University, Village Bujhawar, Tehsil Luni, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, 342008, India."}], "LastName": "Taleuzzaman", "ForeName": "Mohamad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Metab", "NlmUniqueID": "100960533", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O60IE26NUF", "NameOfSubstance": "thymoquinone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Benzoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nigella sativa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35676849", "10.2174/1389200223666220608142506", "CDM-EPUB-124272"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
