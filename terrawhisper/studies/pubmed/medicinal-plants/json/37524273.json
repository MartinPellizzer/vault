Ammonia serves as a significant biomarker of food spoilage which falls under the category of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The designed colorimetric solid-state sensor was comprehensively characterized using FE-SEM, EDS-mapping, XRD, FTIR, and contact angle analyses. The results confirmed the superior stability, water permeability, good crystallinity and desirable morphology of the prepared sensor platform. Additionally, customized smartphone was developed and applied for online signaling and colorimetric analysis. The findings demonstrated two linear ranges: 1-100\u00a0ppb and 0.1-1340\u00a0ppm with a detection limit of 0.02\u00a0ppm. The solid-state sensor exhibited high selectivity in the presence of other VOCs such as methanol, ethanol, acetone, 2-propanol, toluene, humidity, and hexane. It displayed acceptable repeatability in both inter-day (RSD\u00a0=\u00a03.38\u00a0%) and intraday (RSD\u00a0=\u00a03.86\u00a0%), long-term stability over 4\u00a0days as well as reusability over 3\u00a0cycles. We successfully applied this sensing platform for ammonia monitoring in spoiled meat foods including veal, fish and chicken. The results indicated favorable percentage recovery and repeatability, confirming the feasibility and potential applicability of this intelligent packaging system for monitoring freshness. The platform allows for real-time monitoring and data analysis via smartphone-based online signaling, providing a convenient and effective method for ensuring food quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
