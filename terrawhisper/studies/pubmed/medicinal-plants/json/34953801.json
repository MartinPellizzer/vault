Vitexin, a bioflavonoid isolated from various medicinal plants, possesses a variety of activities; however, whether vitexin protects against AIH remains unclear. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the hepatoprotective effects and mechanism of action of vitexin in both an experimental autoimmune hepatitis (EAH) mouse model and in D-galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide (D-GalN/LPS)-induced hepatocyte injury. Syngeneic liver antigen S100 was used to establish EAH. Vitexin treatment significantly decreased the infiltration of inflammatory and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the liver, reduced ALT and AST levels in the serum and attenuated hepatic injury due to oxidative stress. Moreover, vitexin mitigated the upregulation of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 and the downregulation of Bcl-2 in the livers of AIH mice. These regulations were accompanied by not only increased phosphorylation of AMPK, AKT and GSK-3\u03b2 but also activation of Nrf2. Furthermore, vitexin inhibited apoptosis and the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines in D-GalN/LPS-treated AML12\u00a0cells. In addition, vitexin enhanced the phosphorylation of AMPK, AKT and GSK-3\u03b2. When AML12\u00a0cells were treated with an inhibitor of AMPK/AKT or specific siRNA targeting Nrf2, vitexin did not further induce the activation of Nrf2/HO-1. A molecular docking study confirmed that vitexin could interact with AMPK through hydrogen bonding interactions. In conclusion, vitexin ameliorated hepatic injury in EAH mice through activation of the AMPK/AKT/GSK-3\u03b2 pathway and upregulation of the Nrf2 gene."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
