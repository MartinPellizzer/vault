The aim of this study was to explore why this is so, from their perspective. Sixteen persons with Type 2 diabetes in Yazd City, Iran, were interviewed in April and May 2020 for this study. A thematic analysis of the transcripts of those interviews was done using MAXQDA 10 software. Six themes were identified: beliefs about medicinal plants, psychological factors, accessibility and economic barriers, patients' knowledge and awareness, social pressure, and the role of family culture. The recommendation of the study is that health counselors and specialists should provide needed information and skills for the proper use of medicinal plants, and the pharmaceutical infrastructures need to be expanded to provide enough drugs to facilitate better access to needed medication and reduce reliance on medicinal plants for persons with Type 2 diabetes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Diabetes Research Center, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fattahi Ardakani", "ForeName": "Mojtaba", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Education and Promotion, School of Public Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Salahshouri", "ForeName": "Arash", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, School of Public Health, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sotoudeh", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research, Health Science/Physiology, Clinical Research Development Unit, Hajar Hospital, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fard", "ForeName": "Mohammad Rafati", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Ferdows School of Allied Medicine and Public Health, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran."}], "LastName": "Dashti", "ForeName": "Saeed", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nursing, Ferdows School of Allied Medicine and Public Health, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ahmadi Chenari", "ForeName": "Hadi", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2155-848X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Professor of Nursing, Hunter College, Williston Park, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Baumann", "ForeName": "Steven L", "Initials": "SL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nurs Sci Q", "NlmUniqueID": "8805022", "ISSNLinking": "0894-3184"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interpersonal Relations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}], "CoiStatement": "Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the authorship and/or publication of this review."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38491885", "10.1177/08943184231224454"]}}]}
