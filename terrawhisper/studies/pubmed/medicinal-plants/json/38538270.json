Their easy isolation and growth procedures make bacterial endophytes an untapped source of novel drugs, which might help to face the problem of antimicrobial resistance. This study investigates the antagonistic potential of endophytic bacteria isolated from different compartments of the medicinal plant <i>O. heracleoticum</i> against human opportunistic pathogens.", "A panel of endophytes was employed in cross-streaking tests against multidrug-resistant human pathogens, followed by high-resolution chemical profiling using headspace-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.", "Endophytic bacteria exhibited the ability to antagonize the growth of opportunistic pathogens belonging to the <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> complex (Bcc). The different inhibition patterns observed were related to their taxonomic attribution at the genus level; most active strains belong to the Gram-positive genera <i>Bacillus</i>, <i>Arthrobacter,</i> and <i>Pseudarthrobacter</i>. Bcc strains of clinical origin were more sensitive than environmental strains. Cross-streaking tests against other 36 human multidrug-resistant pathogens revealed the highest antimicrobial activity towards the Coagulase-negative staphylococci and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> strains. Interestingly, strains of human origin were the most inhibited, in both groups. Concerning the production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the strain <i>Arthrobacter</i> sp. OHL24 was the best producer of such compounds, while two <i>Priestia</i> strains were good ketones producers and so could be considered for further biotechnological applications.", "Overall, this study highlights the diverse antagonistic activities of <i>O. heracleoticum</i>-associated endophytes against both Bcc and multidrug-resistant (MDR) human pathogens. These findings hold important implications for investigating bacterial endophytes of medicinal plants as new sources of antimicrobial compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
