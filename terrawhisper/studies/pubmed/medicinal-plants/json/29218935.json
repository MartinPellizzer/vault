In order to probe the control method to this disease, in this study, the mycelial growth rate method was employed to investigate the antifungal effects of extracts from stem-leaf and root, root exudates, and their combination of Scrophularia ningpoensis, Chuanmingshen violaceum and Pinellia ternata The results showed that: \u2460Stem-leaf and root extracts of S. ningpoensis, C. violaceum and P. ternata exhibited different antifungal activities, and the inhibition increased with the increase of extract concentration. The antifungal effect of S. ningpoensis extracts at 0.5 g\u2022mL\u207b\u00b9 was the strongest than other medicinal plants, the inhibition rate of steam-leaf and root extracts reached 74.88%, 69.27%, respectively. The inhibitory effect of C. violaceum and P. ternata was relatively lower, however, there is a significant gain effect after combination of steam-leaf and root extracts of C. violaceum. \u2461The root exudates of S. ningpoensis, C. violaceum and P. ternata showed fungistasis to Phytophthora nicotianae, and fungistasis was enhanced with the increase of root exudate concentration. The antifungal effect in the order of C. violaceum > S. ningpoensis > P. ternata. \u2462The antifungal activity of combination of extract and root exudate from S. ningpoensis was similar with the effect of C. violaceum, they were both stronger than P. ternata, and the antifungal activity for three combination were located between the antifungal activity of their extracts and root exudates. S. ningpoensis and C. violaceum can be potentially applied to prevent and control the tobacco black shank."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zunyi Subsidiary of Guizhou Tobacco Company, Zunyi 563000, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Da-Min", "Initials": "DM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Shui-Ping", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Medical and Pharmaceutical College, Chongqing 401331, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Material Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xue", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zunyi Subsidiary of Guizhou Tobacco Company, Zunyi 563000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zunyi Subsidiary of Guizhou Tobacco Company, Zunyi 563000, China."}], "LastName": "Mo", "ForeName": "Jing-Jing", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Dong-Yan", "Initials": "DY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Xin-Mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Material Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Da-Xia", "Initials": "DX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Exudates"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytophthora"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pinellia"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Exudates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Scrophularia"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29218935", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170814.010"]}}]}
