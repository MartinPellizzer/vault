This was after the effect of the bark extract and bergenin, its isolate, on membrane lipid peroxidation and tissue natural antioxidant defences was reported. Lipid peroxidation was induced experimentally with a single intraperitoneal phenylhydrazine (2,4-DNPH) administration at the end of 3 days exposure to the bark extract or bergenin in drinking water. Three hours later, the brain, liver and red blood cells of the experimental animals were analysed for glucose level and the blood was analysed for selected key indices of oxidative stress: red blood cell (RBC) count haemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV) and white blood cell (WBC) count (total and differential). The bark extract exhibited a protective action on brain glucose, significantly inhibiting the glucose-depleting action of both 2,4-DNPH and ethanol. It also inhibited the lowering action of DNPH and ethanol on PCV, RBC and Hb concentration of rat blood, but inhibited proliferation of white blood cells (total and differential). The data on the effect of bergenin, on the side effects of 2,4-DNPH experimental lipid peroxidation and on ethanol followed an essentially similar trend to those of the bark extract on brain glucose. Bergenin, similar to the bark extract, exerted a protective action on the brain tissue, though to a lesser extent, against the oxidants, 2,4-DNPH and ethanol. It is evident that aqueous ethanol extract of S. gabonensis stem bark has biological antioxidant properties against 2,4-DNPH and ethanol-induced tissue damage exerting its action on the haematological and metabolic side effects of the oxidants. By virtue of its essentially similar activity under the same conditions, bergenin appears to be the phytochemical constituent that is largely responsible for the observed action of the bark extract."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, College of Medical Sciences, University of Maiduguri, Maiduguri, Borno State, Nigeria. chmaduka@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maduka", "ForeName": "H C", "Initials": "HC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okoye", "ForeName": "Z S", "Initials": "ZS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eje", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Vascul Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "101130615", "ISSNLinking": "1537-1891"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzopyrans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylhydrazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1N39KD7QPJ", "NameOfSubstance": "2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L84RBE4IDC", "NameOfSubstance": "bergenin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alcoholic Beverages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzopyrans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylhydrazines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Bark"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14567070", "10.1016/s1537-1891(03)00042-9", "S1537-1891(03)00042-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
