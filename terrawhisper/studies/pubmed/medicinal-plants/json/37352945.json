Nigeria is endowed with an abundance of medicinal plants, many of which are used to treat malaria. Celtis durandii Engl. is one such plant used as a traditional antimalarial remedy in southeast Nigeria. However, its antiplasmodial potential is poorly explored.", "The study aimed at identifying the antiplasmodial components of C. durandii root extract through antiplasmodial activity-guided fractionation.", "Dichloromethane/methanol mixture extract (1:1 v/v) of C. durandii root was prepared and partitioned against water to obtain the organic phase, which was further separated by column chromatography into nine (C1 - C9) fractions. The antiplasmodial activity was evaluated by in vitro screening of the different fractions against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains. Further purification of the active column fractions resulted in a potent anti-Plasmodial compound that was subsequently investigated for its effect on \u03b2-hematin formation. Additionally, the isolated compound was characterized and identified as marmesin using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.", "Celtis durandii root extract exhibited promising antiplasmodial activity {IC<sub>50</sub> (\u03bcg/ml) 5.92, 6.04, and 6.92} against PfW2mef, PfINDO, and Pf3D7 respectively. Pooled fractions with good antiplasmodial activity {IC<sub>50</sub> (\u03bcg/ml) Pf3D7: 3.99; PfINDO: 2.24} and selectivity for the parasites (SI: 21) yielded a compound that was fourteen-fold potent in antiplasmodial activity against Pf3D7(IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.28\u00a0\u03bcg/ml). It also inhibited \u03b2-hematin formation with an IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0150\u00a0\u03bcM. Further studies using spectral data, literature, and chemical databases identified the purified compound as marmesin.", "This work has demonstrated that Celtis durandii root extract has good antiplasmodial activity against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant P. falciparum.
