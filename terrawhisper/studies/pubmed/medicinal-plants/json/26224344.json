Topical therapy is extremely important for the management of dermatological condition in animals. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of biogenic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in combination with herbal oils against animal skin infections which may be responsible for causing infections in human beings. Here, the authors synthesised and characterised the AgNPs from Azadirachta indica. The oils were extracted from medicinal plants including Cymbopogon citratus, Cymbopogon martini, Eucalyptus globules, A. indica and Ocimum sanctum and the antifungal and antibacterial activity of plant oils along with AgNPs were evaluated. An excision wound model was used for the study of wound healing activity in rabbits. AgNPs functionalised oil has demonstrated remarkable antimicrobial activity against pathogens present on the skin of animals. The nano-functionalised antimicrobial oils were used in the formulation of shampoo, soap and ointment for veterinary dermatology. Antimicrobial products of plant origin with AgNPs are valuable, safe and have a specific role in controlling diseases. The authors believe that this approach will be a good alternative therapy to solve the continuous antibiotic resistance developed by many bacterial pathogens and will be utilised in various animal contacting areas in medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanobiotechnology Laboratory, Department of Biotechnology, SGB Amravati University, Amravati 444 602, India."}], "LastName": "Bansod", "ForeName": "Sunita Dashrath", "Initials": "SD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanobiotechnology Laboratory, Department of Biotechnology, SGB Amravati University, Amravati 444 602, India."}], "LastName": "Bawaskar", "ForeName": "Manisha Subrashrao", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanobiotechnology Laboratory, Department of Biotechnology, SGB Amravati University, Amravati 444 602, India."}], "LastName": "Gade", "ForeName": "Aniket Krishnarao", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanobiotechnology Laboratory, Department of Biotechnology, SGB Amravati University, Amravati 444 602, India. mkrai123@rediffmail.com."}], "LastName": "Rai", "ForeName": "Mahendra Kumar", "Initials": "MK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "IET Nanobiotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101303205", "ISSNLinking": "1751-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ointments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soaps"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Veterinary Drugs"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Green Chemistry Technology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ointments"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soaps"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Veterinary Drugs"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26224344", "10.1049/iet-nbt.2014.0042"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
