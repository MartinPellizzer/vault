In this study, the results showed that xanthone 1 is a potent inducer of anti-proliferation and apoptosis in HL-60 cells. When the cells treated with lower concentrations of xanthone 1 (12.4-74.4microM), significant proliferation inhibition was detected by cell viability assay and morphological analyses, and conspicuous G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest were observed by flow cytometric (FCM) analysis. However, when the cells treated with higher doses of xanthone 1 (82.7-330.8microM), significant apoptosis was observed by double sequential AO/EB staining, DNA fragmentation assay and FCM analysis. In addition, conspicuous DNA damage was detected by comet assay. In short, all the results showed that xanthone 1 had a significant cytotoxic effect and could induce proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in HL-60 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. It was possible that xanthone 1 could induce DNA damage in HL-60 cells, which resulted in G1 phase arrest at the lower concentrations and G2/M phase arrest at the higher concentrations, thus inhibiting the cell proliferation, and irreparable DNA damage at the higher concentrations might be responsible for the occurrence of apoptosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Northwest Normal University, No. 967 Anning East Road, Lanzhou 730070, PR China. dinglan@nwnu.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Lan", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Lin-Lin", "Initials": "LL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Qi-Yin", "Initials": "QY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qiong", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol In Vitro", "NlmUniqueID": "8712158", "ISSNLinking": "0887-2333"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "1-hydroxy-3,7,8-trimethoxyxanthone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Comet Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gentianaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HL-60 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tibet"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthones"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19344684", "10.1016/j.tiv.2009.01.010", "S0887-2333(09)00013-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
