It was characterized by drying of leaflet margins to drying of complete leaflets of older leaves. The oldest leaves were the most affected and the intensity of necrosis decreased toward the apical meristem. A single recessive gene, designated nec, was found to govern the necrotic characteristic. The nec locus was linked to gl (glabrous shoots) with a map distance of 16 +/- 3 cM. The loci slv (simple leaves), mlv (multipinnate leaves), nlv (narrow leaflets), hg (prostrate growth habit), P (pink corolla), and shp (round seed shape) segregated independently of nec."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Jawaharlal Nehru Agricultural University, Jabalpur, India. pmgaur@jnau.mp.nic.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gaur", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gour", "ForeName": "V K", "Initials": "VK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Hered", "NlmUniqueID": "0375373", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1503"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Necrosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10739134", "10.1093/jhered/91.1.79"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
