These results were obtained by separating the extracted proteins into anionic and cationic species by chromatography on CM-cellulose at pH 5.5 and analysing each kind of proteins. Anionic species were subjected to chromatography on DEAE-cellulose which lead to isolation of one nuclease (A1) and two RNAases (A2, A3), the properties of which were studied. It was shown that the RNAases pH optima are near 6; A2 is more thermolabile than A3; both are endonucleases unable to attack double-stranded structure; studies with homopolymers, i.e. poly(A), poly(I), poly(C), poly(U), showed that their base specificities were analogous to that of already known plant RNAases. The cationic proteins, analysed with CM-cellulose, contain two RNAases (C1, C2). The pH optima were near 6 and 7, respectively; C1 is much more thermolabile than C2; both were endonucleases inactive on double-stranded structures. C1 and C2 hydrolysed poly(C) and poly(U) but not poly(A) and poly(U)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Beopoulos", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Esnault", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Buri", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biochim Biophys Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0217513", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "24936-38-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Poly A-U"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribonucleases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O84C90HH2L", "NameOfSubstance": "Poly I-C"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cations"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isoelectric Point"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Poly A-U"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Poly I-C"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ribonucleases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23832", "10.1016/0005-2787(78)90049-7", "0005-2787(78)90049-7"]}}]}
