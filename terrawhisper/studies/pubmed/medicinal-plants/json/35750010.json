Neurodegenerative disorders are a range of progressive neural abnormalities characterized by cellular dysfunctions, neuronal structure, and function loss. Among many chronic disorders, oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysregulation, and cellular alterations in the human body are considered the most prevalent diagnostic symptoms. They have a profound impact on patients' health and wellbeing. The disease's poor curability, high healthcare costs, and lethality are the principal reasons for approaching and exploring the conventional treatment's phytotherapeutic alternatives. Ginkgo biloba (Maidenhair tree) is a well-known and widely used herbal plant in the Ginkgoaceae family. Its phytochemical constituents, Flavonoids, and terpenes, have been identified as the primary ingredients of Ginkgo biloba leaf extracts. It has been widely used due to its therapeutic properties, including its neuroprotective, anti-dementia, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasoactive, anti-psychotic, anti-neoplastic, and anti-platelet activity. In recent decades, plenty of Ginkgo-derived substances has been researched and elucidated to have significant therapeutic effects in numerous disease models. This review aims to provide a thorough understanding of the botanical basis for Ginkgo biloba, its usage as herbal medicine, and its pivotal role in functional foods. Additionally, the clinical significance of Ginkgo biloba, as observed in various research works and clinical investigations, is also emphasized, facilitating a better understanding of their molecular basis and application in many chronic diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
