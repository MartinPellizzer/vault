Among the most studied pharmacological activities of maytansine over the past few decades are anticancer and anti-bacterial effects. The anticancer mechanism of action is primarily mediated through interaction with the tubulin thereby inhibiting the assembly of microtubules. This ultimately leads to decreased stability of microtubule dynamics and cause cell cycle arrest, resulting in apoptosis. Despite its potent pharmacological effects, the therapeutic applications of maytansine in clinical medicine are quite limited due to its non-selective cytotoxicity. To overcome these limitations, several derivatives have been designed and developed mostly by modifying the parent structural skeleton of maytansine. These structural derivatives exhibit improved pharmacological activities as compared to maytansine. The present review provides a valuable insight into maytansine and its synthetic derivatives as anticancer agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
