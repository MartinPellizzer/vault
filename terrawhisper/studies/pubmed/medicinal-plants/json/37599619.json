The rich bioactive compounds of medicinal horehound, as well as their antioxidant activity have led to its wider application in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. The present work aimed to determine the phenolic compounds, total phenols, flavonoids, and antioxidant activity at vegetative and reproductive growth stages of <i>Marrubium vulgare</i>. The experiments were performed in Eram Garden with five replications and using SPSS software (v. 13) and Mann-Whitney <i>U</i>-Test at <i>p</i>\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01. The total content of flavonoids and main phenolic compounds increased when plants collected at vegetative stage. On the other hand, the highest vanillin content was observed in full flowering stage. Overall, this study can provide useful information about the best harvest period for horehound to produce the desired compounds for use in the food, pharmaceutical, and plant industries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, Yasuj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aeineh", "ForeName": "Mahdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agriculture, Payame Noor University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Najafian", "ForeName": "Sharareh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, Yasuj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Yasuj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security Research Group, Yasuj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseinifarahi", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37599619", "10.1080/14786419.2023.2245116"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
