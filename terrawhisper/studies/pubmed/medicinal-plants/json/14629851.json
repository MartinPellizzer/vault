The dietitians scored an average of 5.4 of a possible 8 on the herbal knowledge questions. Seventy-three percent (73%) perceived themselves to have little or no knowledge of herbal supplements. Only 37% reported using herbs and 22% recommending herbs to clients in the past year. A significant positive association was observed between herbal supplement knowledge score and frequency of personal use (p = 0.004), and recommendation to clients (p = 0.001). Eighty-nine percent (89%) agreed that herbal supplement education should be incorporated into dietetic curricula.", "The majority of the dietitians may lack herbal supplement familiarity. Therefore, these dietitians may be reluctant to personally use or recommend herbs to clients, even though the majority believe herbs can be effective for specific illness and health maintenance. These results may indicate a need to include more extensive education in the dietetic curricula and to continue education regarding herbal supplements in response to the increasing consumer herbal supplement use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition, South Shore Hospital, South Weymouth, MA 02190-2455, USA. cashmanlinda@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cashman", "ForeName": "Linda S", "Initials": "LS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Burns", "ForeName": "Jeanmarie T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Otieno", "ForeName": "Irene M", "Initials": "IM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fung", "ForeName": "Teresa", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Altern Complement Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9508124", "ISSNLinking": "1075-5535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nonprescription Drugs"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Competence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Dietetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Massachusetts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Nonprescription Drugs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14629851", "10.1089/107555303322524580"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
