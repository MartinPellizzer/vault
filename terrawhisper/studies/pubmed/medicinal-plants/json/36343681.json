Currently, Salvia is widely used to flavor and preserve food. Here, two undescribed norabietane-type diterpenoids, sadigitaloides A and B, two undescribed germacrane-type sesquiterpenoids, sadigitaloides C and D, five undescribed guaiane-type sesquiterpenoid lactones, sadigitaloides E-I, two undescribed noreudesmane-type sesquiterpenoids, sadigitaloides J and K, one known diterpenoid, three known sesquiterpenoids, and three other types of known compounds were isolated from the 95% ethanol extract of the whole plants of Salvia digitaloides. Their structures and absolute configurations were characterized using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic techniques, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, HRESIMS experiments, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Some compounds were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activities against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF-\u03b1 production in rat macrophage NR8383\u00a0cells. Sadigitaloide A showed noticeable anti-inflammatory activity at a concentration of 100.0\u00a0\u03bcM. At a concentration of 60\u00a0\u03bcM, sadigitaloide B exhibited better protection of dopaminergic neurons than the positive control n-butylidenephthalide in the Caenorhabditis elegans model injured by 6-OHDA. The phytotoxic activities of some compounds were attributed to considerable inhibitory effects on the growth of the roots and hypocotyls of Raphanus sativus L seedlings, especially cis, trans-abscisic acid, whose inhibition rates were much higher than those of glyphosate at concentrations ranging from 50 to 400\u00a0ppm. These results indicated that abietane-type diterpenoids possessed excellent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities and further suggested that the low-molecular-weight compounds exhibited outstanding phytotoxic activities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
