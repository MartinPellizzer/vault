TNBC lacks receptors and hence cannot be treated by using targeted therapies; as such, the therapeutic potential of Indonesian herbal plants against this disease is worth exploring. Herein, we explore the molecular docking and the molecular dynamics simulations of \u03b1-mangostin on glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2; PDB ID: 4ACC). Our findings reveal that \u03b1-mangostin has a weaker binding affinity to GSK3\u03b2 than the native ligand (-8.22<b>\u2009</b>kcal/mol), while the latter binds to GSK3\u03b2 with a stronger binding affinity of -8.92<b>\u2009</b>kcal/mol. According to the binding site analysis, the hydrogen bonds of the native ligand on Asp133 and Arg141, while \u03b1-mangostin only appeared to form a hydrogen bond on the enzyme's Asp133. On the other hand, \u03b1-mangostin shares similar docking sites with the native ligand (namely, Ile62, Phe67, Val70, and Thr138), thus leading to the conclusion that the native ligand and \u03b1-mangostin might share a similar molecular mechanism. The molecular dynamics simulation by using the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann and surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations' method shows that \u03b1-mangostin maintains a better affinity (with a value of \u0394GTotal at -114.463<b>\u2009</b>kJ/mol) as compared with the native ligand (with a respective \u0394GTotal value of -75.158<b>\u2009</b>kJ/mol). Our findings are suggestive of \u03b1-mangostin possessing a valuable potential as an anti-TNBC agent through GSK3\u03b2 inhibition.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
