Natural phytochemicals continue to be sought as alternative treatments for various diseases because of their non-toxic and therapeutic properties. In recent years, computational phytochemistry has enabled large-scale screening of phytochemicals, enabling researchers to pursue a wide range of therapeutic research alternatives to traditional ethnopharmacology. We propose to identify an anti-diabetic plant by computational screening on Indian herbal plants in conjunction with experimental characterization and biological validation. The methodology involves the creation of an in-house Indian herbal plant database. Molecular docking is used to screen against alpha amylase for anti-diabetic prophylaxis. <i>Cassia angustifolia</i> was chosen because its phytochemicals are able to bind to alpha amylase. Plants were experimentally extracted, botanically studied and their biological activity was evaluated. Further, the use of molecular dynamics was then applied to pinpoint the phytochemicals responsible for the affinity of alpha amylase. Results in the phytochemical analysis of the extracts revealed strong presence of alkaloids, flavonoids and cardiac glycosides. Moreover, alpha amylase biological activity with <i>C. angustifolia</i> extracts of chloroform, hexane and ethyl acetate demonstrated activity of 3.26, 8.01 and 30.33\u2009\u00b5g/ml validating computational predictions. In conclusion, this study developed, validated computational predictions of identifying potential anti-diabetic plants '<i>Cassia angustifolia</i>' from house herbal databases. Hope this study shall inspire explore plant therapeutic repurposing using computational methods of drug discovery.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
