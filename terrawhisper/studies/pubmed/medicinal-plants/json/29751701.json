Root and tuber of R. glutinosa contains stachyose, raffinose and other oligosaccharides, but the study about the process of growth and development of other organs in the non-structural changes in sugar content is rare.In this study, leaves, stems and roots of R. glutinosa were used as materials to analyze the diurnal variation and the changes of sugar content of sucrose, raffinose and stachyose in different organs of R. glutinosa. The results showed that the content of sucrose in R. glutinosa leaves gradually increased from seedling stage.However, the content of stachyose did not change much at the early stage of growth, and the stachyose rapidly increased at the later stage of growth. The raffinose content gradually decreased throughout the growing season, young leaves of R. glutinosa have higher ability to sucrose synthesis than mature leaves, while mature leaf has higher raffinose and stachyose synthesis ability than young leaves. Sucrose and stachyose content in stem gradually increased, while there was little change in raffinose content. The content of raffinose and stachyose in root increased rapidly from the beginning of fast growing period, while the content of sucrose did not change much. The content of sucrose in leaves of R. glutinosa did not change much at day and night, while the daily changes of raffinose and stachyose contents were very obvious. The contents of raffinose and stachyose in daytime were higher than those at night. The content of raffinose in root and stem was not changed much, but the change of stachyose in root, stem and leaf was very obvious, especially in stem and leaf. In summary, the leaf is the main synthetic organ of raffinose, leaves, stems and roots are stachyose synthesis organ. Sucrose, raffinose and stachyose are the major transport forms of carbohydrates in R. glutinosa."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100102, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dong-Hui", "Initials": "DH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Na", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Xue-Qi", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xian-En", "Initials": "XE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Min-Jian", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rehmannia"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29751701", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180201.003"]}}]}
