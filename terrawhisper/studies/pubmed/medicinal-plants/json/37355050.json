The great interest in this bioactive compound is related to the positive effects in human health. However, its limited solubility, moderate biological activity and poor bioavailability limit the potential and further applications of UA. Here, we explored the efficacy of MeON-Glycosides of UA in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation. A number of compounds showed significant antitumor activity against tested five cancer cell lines. Among them, compound 2a exhibited the most potent activity against HepG2 cells with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 3.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u03bcM. Especially, compound 2a could induce HepG2 cells apoptosis and reduce mitochondrial membrane potential. Western blot analysis showed that compound 2a up-regulated Bax, cleaved caspase-3/9, cleaved PARP levels and down-regulated Bcl-2 level of HepG2 cells. These results indicated that compound 2a could obviously induce the apoptosis of HepG2 cells. At the same time, compound 2a significantly decreased the expression of p-AKT and p-mTOR, which indicated that compound 2a might exert its cytotoxic effect by targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Moreover, the in silico ADME predictions showed that compound 2a has improved water solubility and other properties. Thus, compound 2a may be a promising antitumor candidate, which may be potentially used to prevent or treat cancers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
