Therefore, the current research was aimed to evaluate the phytochemical constituents and potential antioxidant, in vitro anticancer and antibacterial activity of Carpesium nepalense seeds essential oil. The analysis performed through Gas chromatography/Mass spectroscopy confirmed the presence of different types of biologically active compounds. At the concentration of 500\u03bcg/mL, n-hexane fraction of C. nepalense showed highly significant (P<0.001) antioxidant activity in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid and superoxide assays with the percentage inhibitions of 86.60\u00b11.6%, 82.55\u00b11.0% and 80.50\u00b11.0% respectively. The extract also produced highly significant anticancerous activity against different cell lines at 500\u03bcg/mL. The significant antibacterial activity of extract was observed against bacterial strains with the zone of inhibitions of 24.3\u00b10.8, 28.20\u00b10.10, 22.33\u00b10.11 and 33.22\u00b10.10 mm respectively. The significant damage in bacterial cell membranes was also observed in atomic force microscopic analysis. In the light of obtained findings, it is concluded that C. nepalence proved to be a potential candidate as an alternative medicinal agent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jinnah Sindh Medical University Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Burki", "ForeName": "Samiullah", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy for Girls, Prince Sattam Bin Abdul Aziz University, Al-Kharj, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Zehravi", "ForeName": "Mahrukh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jinnah Sindh Medical University Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Asghar", "ForeName": "Muhammad Arif", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Ijaz", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Burki", "ForeName": "Zeba Gul", "Initials": "ZG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jinnah Sindh Medical University Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rehman", "ForeName": "Ahad Abdul", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jinnah Sindh Medical University Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ansar", "ForeName": "Humaira", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "33"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34836869"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
