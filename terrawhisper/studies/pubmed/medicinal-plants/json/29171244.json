The sequence of ITS2 and psbA-trnH in fifty-one samples were amplified and sequenced, MEGA 6.0 was used to analyze the intra- and interspecific K-2P distances, neighbor-joining (NJ) tree was used to constructing clustering tree. ITS2 sequence analyzed results showed that there is no intra-specific variation among Morus alba, M. alba var. tatarica and M. nigra, but 13 variations sites were exist between M. alba and M. nigra and their inter-specific K-2P distances was 0.04, which indicated that there had significant variation in them. We didn't find informative variation sites between Morus genus plants and commercial products, and we also found that M. nigra can be distinguished from other two species by NJ Tree. PsbA-trnH analysis results showed there was only one variation site between M. alba and M. nigra, but insertion or deletion variation were remarkable evidence among M. alba, M. alba var. tatarica and M. Nigra. Inter-specific variation was accordance with intra-specific variation of commercial products. So ITS2 and psbA-trnH gene were important marker for M. alba, M. alba var. tatarica and M. nigra identification. This study provided important evidence for Uygur medicine identification and market supervision."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Institute of Chinese Materia Medica and Ethnical Materia State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ethnic Medicine Resources, Urumqi 830002, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Cong-Zhao", "Initials": "CZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Institute of Chinese Materia Medica and Ethnical Materia State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ethnic Medicine Resources, Urumqi 830002, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jian-Guo", "Initials": "JG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Testing Center of Xinjiang Entry Exit Inspection and Quarantine Portal, Urumqi 830063, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ya-Wei", "Initials": "YW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Institute of Chinese Materia Medica and Ethnical Materia State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ethnic Medicine Resources, Urumqi 830002, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao-Jin", "Initials": "XJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Ribosomal Spacer"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Ribosomal Spacer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Morus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29171244", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170714.019"]}}]}
