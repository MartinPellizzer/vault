The content of the oil obtained by hydrodistillation was 0.95% in the herb and 1.25% in the rhizome (per dry weight basis). Gas chromatography (GC) with MS detection and flame ionisation detection showed that the oil from the rhizome contains 39 compounds, of which 29 were identified. Gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection in chiral columns against standard compounds showed the presence of enantiomers of some of the components of the oil. Compounds present in largest quantities are: sabinene (35.2%) of which (+) sabinene accounts for (96.54%) and 4-terpineol (26.6%) of which (+) 4-terpineol accounts for (65.8%). 44 components were found in the herb essential oil, of which 39 compounds were identified. Compounds present in largest quantities were beta-caryophyllene (16.1%) and alpha-humulene (15.8%). The content of sabinene in the herb oil was 4.7%. The following compounds were present in the herb oil only as enantiomers: (+) sabinene (4.7%), (-) limonene (4.4%), (-) beta-pinene (0.4%). A coumarin (osthole) was detected in both essential oils (5.5% in herb oil and 5.1% in rhizome oil)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Wroc\u0142aw University of Medicine, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cisowski", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sawicka", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mardarowicz", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Asztemborska", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luczkiewicz", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Z Naturforsch C J Biosci", "NlmUniqueID": "8912155", "ISSNLinking": "0341-0382"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11837677", "10.1515/znc-2001-11-1202"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
