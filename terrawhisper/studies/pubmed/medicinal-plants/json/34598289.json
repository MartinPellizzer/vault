Research in the field of Yemeni ethnoveterinary medicine is limited to a few studies. Therefore, our work aims to substantiate scientifically the ethnoveterinary use of some documented plant species based on a literature review of their bioactivities and toxicological properties. Searching the scientific literature has revealed various pharmacological activities that may support the claimed healing activities of 11 out of 14 plant species for some of their ethnoveterinary utilization. This comprises the use of <i>Aloe</i> spp. latex for constipation, worms, boils, and wounds; <i>Boswellia sacra</i> underbark for wounds and its oleo-gum resin for mastitis; Soqotraen <i>Boswellia</i> species as an insect repellent; <i>Cissus rotundifolia</i> for stomach pain; <i>Cyphostemma digitatum</i> as an appetite stimulant; <i>Psiadia punctulate</i> for bone fracture; <i>Pulicaria undulata</i> as an insect repellent; combinations of <i>Aristolochia bracteolate</i> with <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> grains for bloating; <i>Rumex nervosus</i> and salt for eye pimples; and <i>Trigonella foenum-graecum</i> seeds with <i>Hordeum vulgare</i> grains for constipation. Some plants were found to demonstrate various toxic effects in <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> experimental studies. The local administration of <i>Calotropis procera</i> latex was also reported to induce an intense inflammatory response. It can be concluded that our work has provided valuable scientific information on the biological and toxic activities of some Yemeni ethnoveterinary remedies that could be utilized for the benefit of farmers to ration the use of these remedies and avoiding their toxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Thieme.
