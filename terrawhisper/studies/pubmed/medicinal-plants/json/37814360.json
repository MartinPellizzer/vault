However, the defence responses and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we aimed to investigate the molecular reprogramming in S. glabra leaves infected with C. gloeosporioides . Leaf tissues at 0, 24 and 48h post-inoculation (hpi) were analysed by combining RNA sequencing and Tandem Mass Tag-based liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. In total, 18\u2009441 and 25\u2009691 differentially expressed genes were identified at 24 and 48hpi compared to 0hpi (uninoculated control), respectively. In addition, 1240 and 1570 differentially abundant proteins were discovered at 24 and 48hpi compared to 0hpi, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed that transcription and translation levels were highly consistent regarding repeatability and expression. Analyses using databases KEGG and iPATH revealed tricitric acid cycle, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were induced, whereas photosynthesis and tryptophan were suppressed. Enzymatic activity assay results were consistent with the upregulation of defence-related enzymes including superoxide dismutases, catalases, peroxidases and chitinases. The transcriptome expression results were additionally validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses. This study provides insights into the molecular reprogramming in S. glabra leaves during infection, which lay a foundation for investigating the mechanisms of host-Colletotrichum interactions and breeding disease-resistant plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "<institution content-type=\"university\">College of Agriculture, Guangxi University</institution>, <city>Nanning</city> <postal-code>530004</postal-code>, <country>China</country>; and <institution content-type=\"university\">Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants</institution>, <city>Nanning</city> <postal-code>530023</postal-code>, <country>China</country>."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Ni", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "<institution content-type=\"university\">College of Agriculture, Guangxi University</institution>, <city>Nanning</city> <postal-code>530004</postal-code>, <country>China</country>; and <institution content-type=\"university\">Guangdong Key Laboratory of High Technology for Plant Protection, Institute of Plant Protection, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences</institution>, <city>Guangzhou</city> <postal-code>510640</postal-code>, <country>China</country>."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Birun", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "<institution content-type=\"university\">Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants</institution>, <city>Nanning</city> <postal-code>530023</postal-code>, <country>China</country>."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Lisha", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "<institution content-type=\"university\">Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants</institution>, <city>Nanning</city> <postal-code>530023</postal-code>, <country>China</country>."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Guiyu", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "<institution content-type=\"university\">Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants</institution>, <city>Nanning</city> <postal-code>530023</postal-code>, <country>China</country>."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhanjiang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "<institution content-type=\"university\">College of Animal Science and Technology, Guangxi University</institution>, <city>Nanning</city> <postal-code>530004</postal-code>, <country>China</country>; and <institution content-type=\"university\">Department of Omics Technology, Nanning Current Science Biotechnology Co., Ltd</institution>., <city>Nanning</city> <postal-code>530005</postal-code>, <country>China</country>."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Funct Plant Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101154361", "ISSNLinking": "1445-4416"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteome"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Colletotrichum gloeosporioides"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptome"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Colletotrichum"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Proteome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Breeding"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "51"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37814360", "10.1071/FP23084", "FP23084"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
