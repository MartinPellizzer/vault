Based on shape, GC is divided into two groups: jiaobei and dubei. It is a bitter, sour, cold and astringent substance which is usually used for treating diarrhea, constipation, bleeding, cough, vomiting, sweating, hemorrhoids, and anal and uterine prolapse. It is distributed in Japan, North Korea, and all parts of China.", "This study was aimed at carrying out a comprehensive overview of the current status of research on Galla chinensis (GC) for better understanding of it characteristics, while providing a clear direction for future studies. It has aroused the interest of researchers, leading to development of medicinal value, expansion of its application, and provision of wider and more effective drug choices. This study was focused on the traditional uses, botany, chemical composition, pharmacology and toxicology of GC. Finally, the study focused on possible future research directions for GC.", "A comprehensive analysis was done based on academic papers, pharmaceutical monographs, ancient medicinal works, and drug standards of China. This review used Galla and Galla chinensis as keywords for retrieval of information on GC from online databases such as PubMed, Elsevier, CNKI, Web of Science, Google Scholar, SCI hub, and Baidu academic.", "It was found that the chemical constituents of GC included tannins, phenolic acid, amino acids and fatty acid, with polyphenol compounds (especially tannins and gallic acid) as the distinct components. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that GC exerted numerous biological effects such as anti-caries, antibacterial, antiviral, anticancer, and antioxidant effects. The therapeutic effect of GC was attributed mainly to the biological properties of its bioactive components.", "GC is an important TCM which has potential benefit in the treatment of a variety of diseases. However, the relationship amongst the structure and biological activity of GC and its components, mechanism of action, toxicity, pharmacokinetics and target organs need to be further studied. Quality control and quality assurance programs for GC need to be further developed. There is need to study the dynamics associated with the accumulation of chemical compounds in GC as well as the original plants and aphid that form GC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
