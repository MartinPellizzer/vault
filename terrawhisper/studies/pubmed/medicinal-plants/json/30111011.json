They have essential pharmacological value for human health. In plants, the enzymes responsible for the formation of phenolic metabolites backbone structures are collectively known as type \u2162 polyketide synthases (PKSs), which are the key enzymes for the polyketides biosynthesis. The PKSs catalyze a series of condensation reactions of two-carbon acetate units with an acyl starter. A brief overview of this group of enzymes, including their reaction mechanisms, function modification, expression regulation, molecular evolution, and recent interesting findings are presented here."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai&an 271018, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education & National Engineering Laboratory for Breeding of Endangered Medicinal Materials, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bin-Bin", "Initials": "BB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education & National Engineering Laboratory for Breeding of Endangered Medicinal Materials, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Resources Conservation and Development of Southern Medicine & Key Laboratory of State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine for Agarwood Sustainable Utilization, Hainan Branch of the Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Haikou 570311, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Jian-He", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai&an 271018, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Zhen-Qiao", "Initials": "ZQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education & National Engineering Laboratory for Breeding of Endangered Medicinal Materials, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Zhi-Hui", "Initials": "ZH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "79956-01-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyketide Synthases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.1.74", "NameOfSubstance": "flavanone synthetase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polyketide Synthases"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30111011", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180514.003"]}}]}
