Thereafter, five braised carp samples were collected from each of the five selected sites and their microbiological quality assessed. The results showed that all the braising sites do not satisfy the Good Hygiene and Manufacturing Practices. Pathogenic microorganisms such as coliforms (2.17 \u00b1 0.08 to 5.94 \u00b1 0.38 Log cfu/g), <i>E.\u00a0coli</i> (3.71 \u00b1 0.20 to 6.21 \u00b1 0.48 Log cfu/g) and <i>Salmonella</i> spp. were found in braised carp samples at levels higher than the microbiological criteria of the European Commission which are 1, 1 and 0 Log cfu/g, respectively. Spoilage microorganisms such as yeasts (2.39 \u00b1 0.18 to 3.09 \u00b1 0.23 Log cfu/g) and moulds (2.30 \u00b1 0.10 to 2.92 \u00b1 0.18 Log cfu/g) as well as spore-forming (3.02 \u00b1 0.18 to 4.86 \u00b1 0.35 Log cfu/g) and anaerobic (3.74 \u00b1 0.28 to 4.52 \u00b1 0.38 Log cfu/g) bacteria were also found at higher levels.
