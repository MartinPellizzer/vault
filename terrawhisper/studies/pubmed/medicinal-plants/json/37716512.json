Epitope mapping, employing monoclonal antibodies and mass spectrometry, has emerged as a rapid and precise method to investigate viral antigenic determinants. In this report, we propose an approach to improve the accuracy of epitopic peptide interaction rate recognition. To achieve this, we investigated the interaction between the nucleocapsid protein of fig mosaic virus (FMV-NP) and single-chain variable fragment antibodies (scFv-Ab). These scFv-Ab maintain high specificity similar to whole monoclonal antibodies, but they are smaller in size. We coupled this with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The experimental design involved using two different enzymes to digest FMV-NP separately. The resulting peptides were then incubated separately with the desired scFv-Ab at different incubation times and antibody concentrations. This allowed us to monitor the relative rate of epitopic peptide interaction with the antibody. The results demonstrated that, at a 1:1 ratio and after 2\u00a0h of interaction, the residues 122-136, 148-157, and 265-276 exhibited high-rate epitopic peptide binding, with reductions in peak intensity of 78%, 21%, and 22%, respectively. Conversely, the residues 250-264 showed low-rate binding, with a 15% reduction in peak intensity. This epitope mapping approach, utilizing scFv-Ab, two different enzymes, and various incubation times, offers a precise and dependable analysis for monitoring and recognizing the binding kinetics of antigenic determinants. Furthermore, this method can be applied to study any kind of antigens."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
