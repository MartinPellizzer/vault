This study introduces an environmentally sustainable remediation technique, utilizing NiO nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized through green chemistry to immobilize a metagenome-derived laccase, PersiLac1, enhancing its application in pollutant detoxification. Salvadora persica leaf extract was used for the synthesis of NiO nanoparticles, utilizing its phytochemical constituents as reducing and capping agents, followed by characterization through different analyses. Characterization of NiO nanoparticles revealed distinctive FTIR absorption peaks indicating the nanoparticulate structure, while FESEM showed structured NiO with robust interconnections and dimensionality of about 50nm, confirmed by EDX analysis to have a consistent distribution of Ni and O. The immobilized PersiLac1 demonstrated enhanced thermal stability, with 85.55\u00a0% activity at 80\u00a0\u00b0C and reduced enzyme leaching, retaining 67.93\u00a0% activity across 15 biocatalytic cycles. It efficiently reduced rice straw (RS) phenol by 67.97\u00a0% within 210\u00a0min and degraded 70-78\u00a0% of tetracycline (TC) across a wide pH range (4.0-8.0), showing superior performance over the free enzyme. Immobilized laccase achieved up to 71\u00a0% TC removal at 40-80\u00a0\u00b0C, significantly outperforming the free enzyme. Notably, 54\u00a0% efficiency was achieved at 500\u00a0mg/L TC by immobilized laccase at 120\u00a0min. This research showed the potential of green-synthesized NiO nanoparticles to effectively immobilize laccase, presenting an eco-friendly approach to purify pollutants such as phenols and antibiotics. The durability and reusability of the immobilized enzyme, coupled with its ability to reduce pollutants, indicates a viable method for cleaning the environment. Nonetheless, the production costs and scalability of NiO nanoparticles for widespread industrial applications pose significant challenges. Future studies should focus on implementation at an industrial level and examine a wider range of pollutants to fully leverage the environmental clean-up capabilities of this innovative technology."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
