The plants cultivated in Cd amended soil showed reduced growth, dry mass, gas-exchange capacity, and chlorophyll contents. Furthermore, the plants exhibited elevated levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) under Cd stress. The bacterized plants showed higher shoot length, root length; fresh and dry weight. The improved stress tolerance in inoculated plants was attributed to the reduced quantity of MDA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, enhanced synthesis of protein, proline, phenols, flavonoids, and improved activity of antioxidant enzymes including peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, and catalase. Similarly, the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase activity, phosphate solubilization, auxin, and siderophore production capability of B. cepacia CS8 improved growth and stress alleviation in treated plants. The bacterial inoculation enhanced the amount of water extractable Cd from soil. Furthermore, the inoculated plants showed higher bioconcentration factor and translocation factor. The current study exhibits that B. cepacia CS8 improves stress alleviation and phytoextraction potential of C. roseus plants growing under Cd stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a College of Earth and Environmental Sciences , University of the Punjab , Lahore , Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Waheed Ullah", "Initials": "WU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Senior Superintendent Garden, RO-II Office , University of the Punjab , Lahore , Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Yasin", "ForeName": "Nasim Ahmad", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a College of Earth and Environmental Sciences , University of the Punjab , Lahore , Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Sajid Rashid", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Botany , University of Sargodha , Sargodha , Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Aamir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Research Scholar , Institute for Medicinal Plants, College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University , Wuhan , China."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Aqeel", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Research Scholar , Institute for Medicinal Plants, College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University , Wuhan , China."}], "LastName": "Akram", "ForeName": "Waheed", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics , University of the Punjab , Lahore , Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Faisal", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Phytoremediation", "NlmUniqueID": "101136878", "ISSNLinking": "1522-6514"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Burkholderia cepacia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catharanthus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29688047", "10.1080/15226514.2017.1405378"]}}]}
