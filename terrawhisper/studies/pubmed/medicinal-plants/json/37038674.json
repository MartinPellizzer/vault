With the exponential increase in the number of new pesticides being synthesized, it becomes more and more important to evaluate the toxicity of pesticides by means of simulated calculations. Based on existing data, machine learning methods can train and model the predictions of the effects of novel pesticides, which have limited available data. Combined with other technologies, this can aid the synthesis of new pesticides with specific active structures, detect pesticide residues, and identify their tolerable exposure levels. This article mainly discusses support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis, decision trees, partial least squares, and algorithms based on feedforward neural networks in machine learning. It is envisaged that this article will provide scientists and users with a better understanding of machine learning and its application prospects in pesticide toxicity assessment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of life Science, Shanghai University, 99 Shangda Road, Shanghai, 200444, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yunfeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of life Science, Shanghai University, 99 Shangda Road, Shanghai, 200444, China."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Junjie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of life Science, Shanghai University, 99 Shangda Road, Shanghai, 200444, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Songyu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of life Science, Shanghai University, 99 Shangda Road, Shanghai, 200444, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jiajun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of life Science, Shanghai University, 99 Shangda Road, Shanghai, 200444, China."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Yihan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory of Southwest Endangered Medicinal Resources Development, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, Goang Xi, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Xiaosheng", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of life Science, Shanghai University, 99 Shangda Road, Shanghai, 200444, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of life Science, Shanghai University, 99 Shangda Road, Shanghai, 200444, China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101240303", "ISSNLinking": "1573-4064"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neural Networks, Computer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Machine Learning"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37038674", "10.2174/1573406419666230406091759", "MC-EPUB-130729"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
