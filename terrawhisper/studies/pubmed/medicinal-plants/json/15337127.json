The work contained data on various materials of botanical, biological and mineral origin which were claimed to provide benefit to sufferers from epilepsy, though often with no clear underlying rationale for their use. Some of these materials continued to be used as antiepileptic remedies over many centuries till they were finally recognised to be without useful effect in the disorder. The longest survivor amongst the Dioscoridean antiepileptic remedies was a rather esoteric one, viz. two stones taken from the belly of a young swallow during the rising phase of the moon and also whilst the swallow's parent birds were absent from the nest. The stones, or one of them, were worn against the skin of the seizure sufferer. The use of the swallow stones for epilepsy was recommended as late as in the writings of Thomas Willis (1675)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Queensland, Herston, Brisbane 4029, Australia. m.eadie@mailbox.uq.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eadie", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Scotland", "MedlineTA": "J Clin Neurosci", "NlmUniqueID": "9433352", "ISSNLinking": "0967-5868"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticonvulsants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anticonvulsants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "history"], "DescriptorName": "Epilepsy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 17th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 18th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Medieval"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "history"], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "history", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15337127", "10.1016/j.jocn.2004.01.005", "S0967586804001523"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
