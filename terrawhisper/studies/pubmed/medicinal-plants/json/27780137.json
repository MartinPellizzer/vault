The objective of this study was to investigate the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties of the hydroalcoholic leaf extract of Vitis vinifera (EVV) on experimental models to provide scientific basis for its use.", "The EVV was chemically characterized by LC-MS/MS analyses. The in vitro antioxidant activities of the EVV extract were measured using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay and Ferric reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP). Analgesic activity using acetic acid induced writhing and formalin test in mice, anti-inflammatory activity using carrageenan induced paw oedema and acetic acid-induced vascular permeability in mice, and antipyretic activity using Brewer's yeast induced pyrexia in rats were evaluated at 100mg/kg, 200mg/kg, and 400mg/kg doses of the extract.", "The extract (EVV) was found to contain resveratrol, quercetin, catechin, flavone, flavonols, anthocyanin, gallic acid and epicatechin. EVV produced significant dose-response anti-inflammatory activity against carrageenan-induced paw edema. EVV at dosages of 100, 200 and 400mg/kgbw significantly reduced carrageenan-induced paw edema by 34.48% (P<0.05), 36.20% (P<0.05), and 41.37% (P<0.05) at 5h after carrageenan injection, respectively. Also EVV extract reduces significantly acetic acid-induced vascular permeability in mice dose dependently. EVV (100, 200 and 400mg/kgbw) produced significant dose-response analgesic activity in the formalin test. However, the low percentage inhibition (50%) suggests that it is not a centrally acting analgesic. Extract at dosages of 100, 200 and 400mg/kg bw, p.o. significantly reduced acetic acid-induced writhing by 48.15% (p<0.05), 57.97% (p<0.05), and 68.09% (p<0.05), respectively. The extract also caused marked dose-dependent inhibition of formalin-induced pain in the second phase (p<0.05). Statistical significant reduction in rectal temperatures was observed in standard group at 21 and 23h, and in 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg doses of the extract at 23h (p<0.05) compared with the 19h.", "The results obtained indicated potential analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects of them hydroalcoholic leaf extract of V. vinifera observed at doses tested which support the claim for the traditional use of the plant in the treatment of various inflammatory and pain diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.
