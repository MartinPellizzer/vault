Furthermore we planned the exploration of the biodiversity of these species and the examination of the correlations of the variable elements observed to establish the importance of these factors. Morphological, histological and phytochemical investigations were made. A new analytical method was developed through the systematic optimization of sample preparation and chromatographic (HPLC-DAD) separation. The results of the morphological, histological and phytochemical investigations were analysed by multivariate exploratory techniques. Based on our results, the investigated species can be distinguished as they are strongly heterogenous regarding certain morphological, histological and phytochemical characteristics. We made the first study on the biodiversity of these Gentiana species in their whole habitat in Hungary. Based on the results of the investigations mentioned above, distinct interspecific variability was found, in addition some results showed significant intraspecific variability as well. Numerous correlations were revealed between the variable characteristics, for example significant relationship was found between the average gentiopicroside content of the underground parts of Gentiana cruciata on the biotopes and the slope of the biotope. The knowledge of this variability and these correlations can be a benefit during the introduction and the improvement of medicinal plants with high contents of agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gy\u00f3gyn\u00f6v\u00e9ny Kutat\u00f3 Int\u00e9zet Rt., Budakal\u00e1sz, Lupaszigeti \u00fat 4.-2011."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Szucs", "ForeName": "Zolt\u00e1n", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "D\u00e1nos", "ForeName": "B\u00e9la", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nyiredy", "ForeName": "Szabolcs", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Osszehasonl\u00edt\u00f3 botanikai \u00e9s n\u00f6venyk\u00e9miai vizsg\u00e1latok a Magyarorsz\u00e1gon honos Gentiana fajokkal."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Hungary", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharm Hung", "NlmUniqueID": "0414322", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6659"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "chemistry", "classification", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Gentiana"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hungary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15279034"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
