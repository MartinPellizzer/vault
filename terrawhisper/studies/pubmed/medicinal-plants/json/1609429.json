Cell cultures were exposed to 6, 12, 25 and 50 microM toxins for 2-, 4-, 6- and 24-h periods. Cytotoxicity was determined by release of the cytoplasmic enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), in culture media, methylthiazoltetrazolium (MTT) reduction and neutral red (NR) uptake. An increase in LDH leakage was observed in liver cell cultures as early as 2 h with 50 microM T-544 and with 6 microM T-514 and T-544 at 6 h and 24 h, respectively. In the NR assay the toxicity was evident at 2 h with 12 microM T-514 and T-544 and with 6 microM concentrations of both toxins at 6 h. On the other hand, a decrease in MTT reduction was detected at 4 h with 50 microM concentrations of both toxins and with 25 microM T-544 and 12 microM T-514 at 6 h and 6 microM T-514 and T-544 at 24 h. Both toxins were shown to be highly hepatotoxic; T-514 was more toxic than T-544. In the skin cell cultures, the toxicity of the toxins was not as severe and was not expressed until 12 h of exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Farmacolog\u00eda y Toxicolog\u00eda, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Nuevo, Le\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico."}], "LastName": "Garza-Oca\u00f1as", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hsieh", "ForeName": "G C", "Initials": "GC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Acosta", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Torres-Alan\u00eds", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pi\u00f1eyro-L\u00f3pez", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Toxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "0361055", "ISSNLinking": "0300-483X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthracenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "110270-61-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Karwinskia toxin T-514"}, {"RegistryNumber": "56678-09-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Karwinskia toxin T-544"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Anthracenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Keratinocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhamnus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1609429", "10.1016/0300-483x(92)90102-k", "0300-483X(92)90102-K"]}}]}
