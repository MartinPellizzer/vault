Ham. was studied on the spontaneous movements of the whole worm and nerve-muscle preparation of Setaria cervi and on the survival of micro-filariae in vitro. Aqueous as well as alcoholic extracts caused inhibition of spontaneous motility of the whole worm and nerve-muscle preparation of S. cervi characterized by decreased amplitude, rate and tone of contractions. The concentration required to inhibit the movements of n.m. preparation was 1/3rd for aqueous and 1/20th for alcoholic extract suggesting a cuticular permeability barrier. The effect of S nudicaulis extracts was different than that produced by calcium channel blocker nifedipine on the whole worm and n.m. preparation. While nifedipine blocks the stimulant effect of Ach the extracts of S. nudicaulis fails to do so. While the response bears similarity with DEC which also does not block Ach response. Both aqueous and alcoholic extracts exhibited microfilaricidal action in vitro LC50 and LC90 being 10 and 15 ng/ml for aqueous extract, 5 and 12 ng/ml for alcoholic extract."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, J.N.
