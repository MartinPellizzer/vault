The active principles have not yet been finally elucidated. We have recently shown that hyperforin, a major active constituent of St. John's Wort, not only inhibits the neuronal uptake of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, but also that of L-glutamate and GABA. No other antidepressant compound exhibits a similar broad uptake inhibiting profile. To investigate this unique kind of property, kinetic analyses were performed regarding the uptake of 3H-L-glutamate and 3H-GABA into synaptosomal preparations of mouse brain. Michaelis-Menten kinetics revealed a reduction of Vmax (8.27 to 1.80 pmol/mg/min for 3H-L-glutamate, 2.76 to 0.77 pmol/mg/min for 3H-GABA) while Km was nearly unchanged in both cases, suggesting non-competitive inhibition. The unselective uptake inhibition by hyperforin could be mimicked by the Na+-ionophore monensin and by the Na+-K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain. However, both mechanisms can be discarded for hyperforin. Several amiloride derivatives known to affect sodium conductance significantly enhance 3H-GABA and 3H-L-glutamate uptake and inhibit the uptake inhibition by hyperforin, while monensin or ouabain inhibition were not influenced. Selective concentrations of benzamil for amiloride sensitive Na+-channels and selective concentrations of 5'-ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA) for the Na+-H+-exchangers both had an attenuating effect on the hyperforin inhibition of L-glutamate uptake, suggesting a possible role of amiloride sensitive Na+-channels and Na+-H+-exchangers in the mechanism of action of hyperforin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Biocenter Niederursel, University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wonnemann", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singer", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00fcller", "ForeName": "W E", "Initials": "WE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Neuropsychopharmacology", "NlmUniqueID": "8904907", "ISSNLinking": "0893-133X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "GABA Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ionophores"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neurotransmitter Uptake Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3KX376GY7L", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutamic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "56-12-2", "NameOfSubstance": "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5ACL011P69", "NameOfSubstance": "Ouabain"}, {"RegistryNumber": "906O0YJ6ZP", "NameOfSubstance": "Monensin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DHD7FFG6YS", "NameOfSubstance": "Phloroglucinol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RM741E34FP", "NameOfSubstance": "hyperforin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "GABA Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Glutamic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ionophores"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Monensin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neurotransmitter Uptake Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ouabain"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Phloroglucinol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Channels"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Synaptosomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10882845", "10.1016/S0893-133X(00)00102-0", "S0893-133X(00)00102-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
