The blending of HR (hairy root) cultures with ME (metabolic engineering) approaches offers new insights into, and possibilities for, improving the system productivity for known and/or novel high-value plant-derived active compounds. The introduction and expression of foreign genes in plants results in improvement of cellular activities by manipulating enzymatic, regulatory and transport function of the cell. The rational amendments in the rate-limiting steps of a biosynthetic pathway as well as inactivating the inefficient pathway(s) for by-product formation can be accomplished either through single-step engineering or through the multi-step engineering. The hierarchical control of any metabolic process can lead the engineer to apply the ME ideas and principles to any of the strata, including transcriptional, moving on to translational and enzymatic activity. The HR culture systems offer a remarkable potential for commercial production of a number of low-volume, but high-value, secondary metabolites. Taking HR as a model system, in the present review, we discuss engineering principles and perceptions to exploit secondary-metabolite pathways for the production of important bioactive compounds. We also talk about requisites and possible challenges that occur during ME, with emphasis on examples of various HR systems. Furthermore, it also highlights the utilization of global information obtained from '-omic' platforms in order to explore pathway architecture, structural and functional aspects of important enzymes and genes that can support the design of sets of engineering, resulting in the generation of wide-ranging views of DNA sequence-to-metabolite passageway networking and their control to obtain desired results."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Biotechnology Division, Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, PO CIMAP, Picnic Spot Road, Lucknow-226015, India. shaktimehrotra22@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mehrotra", "ForeName": "Shakti", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "Laiq Ur", "Initials": "LU"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kukreja", "ForeName": "Arun Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Appl Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "8609465", "ISSNLinking": "0885-4513"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Agrobacterium tumefaciens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Botany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Networks and Pathways"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transgenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20731622", "10.1042/BA20100171", "BA20100171"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
