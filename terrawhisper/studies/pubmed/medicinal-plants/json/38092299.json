Previous studies consistently reported that microorganisms were mainly considered pathogens or contaminants. However, with the development of microbial detection technology, it has been demonstrated that fungi and bacteria affect beneficially the medicinal plant production chain.", "Microorganisms greatly affect medicinal plants, with microbial biosynthesis a high regarded topic in medicinal plant-microbial interactions. However, it lacks a systematic review discussing this relationship. Current microbial detection technologies also have certain advantages and disadvantages, it is essential to compare the characteristics of various technologies.", "This review first illustrates the role of fungi and bacteria in various medicinal plant production procedures, discusses the development of microbial detection and identification technologies in recent years, and concludes with microbial biosynthesis of natural products. The relationship between fungi, bacteria, and medicinal plants is discussed comprehensively. We also propose a future research model and direction for further studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
