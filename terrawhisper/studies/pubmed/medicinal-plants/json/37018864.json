In this review, we summarize the physicochemical fundamentals of amorphous silica nucleation and discuss how plants regulate the process of silicification by influencing the thermodynamics and kinetics of silica nucleation. At silicification positions, plants overcome the thermodynamic barrier by establishing the supersaturation of the H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> solution and reducing the interfacial free energy. Among the thermodynamic-drivers, the establishment of supersaturation of H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> solution mainly depends on the expression of Si transporters for H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> supply, evapotranspiration for concentrating Si, and the other solutes in H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> solution for influencing the dissolution equilibrium of SiO<sub>2</sub>; while the interfacial free energy was reduced seemingly by the overexpression Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter SOS1 in high NaCl-stressed rice. Moreover, some kinetic-drivers, such as silicification-related proteins (Slp1 and PRP1) and new cell wall components, are actively expressed or synthesized by plants to interact with silicic acid, thereby reducing the kinetic barrier. According to classical nucleation theory, when the thermodynamic barrier is overcome, the super-saturated silicic acid solution (such as H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> in xylem sap) does not necessarily have to precipitate, just has the potential ability to precipitation. Thus, based on the mediators of SiO<sub>2</sub> deposition at the thermodynamic-driven stage, it is difficult to evaluate whether the process of plant silicification is active or passive. We conclude that the characteristics of kinetic-drivers determine the mechanism of plant silicification."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
