In\u00a0vitro biological evaluation demonstrated that compound 4f was the best pseudo-irreversible hBChE (human butyrylcholinesterase) inhibitor with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.97\u00a0\u03bcM 4f was a potent selective MAO-B (monoamine oxidase-B) inhibitor (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a05.3\u00a0\u03bcM), and could inhibit (58.2%) and disaggregate (43.3%) self-mediated A\u03b2 aggregation. 4f also could reduce the levels of pathological tau and APP clearance, and displayed a wide safe range hepatotoxicity on LO2 cells. The in\u00a0vivo studies revealed that 4f exhibited fascinating dyskinesia recovery rate and response efficiency on AlCl<sub>3</sub>-mediated zebrafish, and demonstrated significant protective effect on vascular injury caused by A\u03b2<sub>1-40</sub>. PET-CT imaging demonstrated that [<sup>11</sup>C]4f exhibited high BBB penetration (especially could reach to hippocampus and striatum of brain) and had a fast brain uptake after intravenous bolus injection. Furthermore, compound 4f could improve scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment. Further, the metabolism in\u00a0vitro of 4f was also investigated, and presented 3 metabolites in rat liver microsome metabolism, 4 metabolites in human liver microsome, and 4 metabolites in rat intestinal flora, providing previous data for the preclinical study. Therefore, these results implied that compound 4f was an advanced multi-function agent and deserved further preclinical study against mild-to-serve Alzheimer's disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.
