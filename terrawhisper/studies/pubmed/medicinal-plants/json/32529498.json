Since current diabetic medications are associated with various side effects, the naturally occurring plant-derived compounds are in demand. Bioflavonoids originating from vegetables and medicinal plants have beneficial effects on diabetes by improving glycemic control, lipid metabolism, and anti-oxidant status. The present study is focused on the effect of rutin against alloxan induced diabetic nephropathy and cardiomyopathy. Male albino Wistar rats were divided into four groups, each of six rats. Group I control rats received 0.9% saline as a single dose intraperitoneally. Group II rats were induced diabetes with a single dose of alloxan monohydrate (150\u00a0mg/kg body weight in 0.9% saline) intraperitoneally. Group III rats received 0.28\u00a0M of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl in drinking water for 3\u00a0days for the experimental induction of metabolic acidosis. Group IV rats were injected with a single dose of alloxan monohydrate (150\u00a0mg/kg bodyweight) and administered rutin hydrate (100\u00a0mg/kg) for a period of 4\u00a0weeks by oral gavage. Administration of rutin prevented urinary ketone body formation and decreased serum creatinine and urea levels in alloxan induced diabetic rats. Rutin supplementation reduced the levels of serum triglycerides and cholesterol in diabetic rats. Gene expression profiling of metabolic acidosis related genes (AQP2, AQP3 and V2R) and also histopathological results demonstrated the protective effect of rutin against diabetic ketoacidodis and fibrosis. The results of the present study revealed rutin administration prevents the progression of diabetic nephropathy and cardiomyopathy through amelioration of fibrosis and metabolic acidosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Cardiology Unit, Department of Biochemistry, Center for Excellence in Genomic Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, 625 021, India."}], "LastName": "Ganesan", "ForeName": "Divya", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Cardiology Unit, Department of Biochemistry, Center for Excellence in Genomic Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, 625 021, India."}], "LastName": "Albert", "ForeName": "Abhishek", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Cardiology Unit, Department of Biochemistry, Center for Excellence in Genomic Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, 625 021, India."}], "LastName": "Paul", "ForeName": "Eldho", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Cardiology Unit, Department of Biochemistry, Center for Excellence in Genomic Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, 625 021, India."}], "LastName": "Ananthapadmanabhan", "ForeName": "Karthikeyan", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Government Sivagangai Medical College and Hospital, Sivagangai, Tamil Nadu, 630 561, India."}], "LastName": "Andiappan", "ForeName": "Rathinavel", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6800-2104"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Cardiology Unit, Department of Biochemistry, Center for Excellence in Genomic Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, 625 021, India. selvam.biological@mkuniversity.org."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Biological Sciences, Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai, 625 021, India. selvam.biological@mkuniversity.org."}], "LastName": "Sadasivam", "ForeName": "Selvam Govindan", "Initials": "SG"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "09,201(0423)/ 18 EMR-I", "Agency": "Council\u00a0of\u00a0Scientific and Industrial Research, India", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mol Cell Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0364456", "ISSNLinking": "0300-8177"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5G06TVY3R7", "NameOfSubstance": "Rutin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SW5YHA5NG", "NameOfSubstance": "Alloxan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Acidosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Alloxan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "complications"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiomyopathies"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "complications"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Nephropathies"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Rutin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32529498", "10.1007/s11010-020-03758-y", "10.1007/s11010-020-03758-y"]}}]}
