According the area of their distribution, they were named Epimedium sagittatum, E. brevicornu, E. acuminatum, E. koreanum, E. pubescens, E. leptorrhizum and E. wushanense. Each distribution in detail and icariin and likewise compounds contents of these 7 species were provided. Other 8 Epimedium species much used were proposed. Medicinal characters 15 species were provided in this paper.", "On the basis of distribution character, resource quantity and growing with other species mingled, it is suggested that 4 main production or purchasing districts in China be divided. The most important district is northeastern district, where only E. koreanum grows there, with the best guality. Northwestern and northern district is the second one, where E. brevicornu, mainly grows with much stable guality. Then it is eastern and southern district, where E. sagittatum grows with the largest quantity but unstable quality. Southwestern district is the last one, mingle species complex and identification important. In Sichuan province, E. acuminatum and E. pubescens are main species, with other 12 species growing there. In Guizhou province, E. acuminatum, E. leptorrhizum and E. wushanense are main species, other 7 species growing there and E. leptorrhizum with poor quality. It is suggested that E. acuminatum be recorded in Chinese Pharmacopoeia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100094, China. blguo@btamail.net.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Bao-lin", "Initials": "BL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Pei-gen", "Initials": "PG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "sagittatoside B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "110623-73-9", "NameOfSubstance": "epimedin B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "110642-44-9", "NameOfSubstance": "epimedin C"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VNM47R2QSQ", "NameOfSubstance": "icariin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Epimedium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacognosy"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15139134"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
