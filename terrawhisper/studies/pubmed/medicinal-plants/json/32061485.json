After screening and evaluation, several SIRT2 selective inhibitors were identified, which can inhibit all the deacetylation, defatty-acylation and debenzoylation of SIRT2. Among these inhibitors, compound 1e was the best SIRT2 selective inhibitors. The primary study on the inhibitory mechanism indicated that compound 1e may be a suicide inhibitor acting as an irreversible way. Given almost all reported sirtuin inhibitors are non-covalent, sirtuin covalent inhibitors are still need to be developed. These findings will facilitate for further development of SIRT2 selective and suicide inhibitors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
