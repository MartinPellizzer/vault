This plant is native to China and cultivated in China, Korea, Japan, and northern Vietnam (Kwak et al. 2020). Viral diseases caused remarkable loss in the yield and quality of R. glutinosa (Ling et al. 2009). To date, ten viruses have been identified globally to infect R. glutinosa and seven of these viruses reported in China (Liu et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2021). Most plants of R. glutinosa are infected with one or more of these viruses (Kwak et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2004). In July 2020, a survey of the viral disease infecting R. glutinosa was conducted in commercial plantations of Wenxian, Wuzhi, Mengzhou, and Yuzhou counties in Henan Province, China. The disease symptoms included mosaic, chlorosis, leaf distortion, and the percentage of symptomatic plants was over 70% in the surveyed fields (n=9). Sixty leaf samples of symptomatic R. glutinosa plants were collected from nine cultivation fields in Wenxian, Wuzhi, Mengzhou, and Yuzhou counties (five to seven plants for each field). Total RNA was extracted from one pooled sample containing a portion of all above-mentioned leaf samples using RNAprep Pure Plant Plus Kit (TIANGEN Biotech, Beijing, China) and analyzed by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to identify viral pathogens. A transcriptome library was generated using NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA), and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 sequencing system at Berry Genomics Corporation (Beijing, China). A total of 27,664,949 high-quality clean reads were obtained after trimming and used for contig assembly. The assembled contigs (n=109,180) were searched using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) at GenBank. BLASTn analysis showed that the R. glutinosa plants were infected with known viruses, including broad bean wilt virus, rehmannia mosaic virus, youcai mosaic virus, and cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus. In addition, one contig (6,418 nt in length) had a nucleotide sequence identity of 99.64% with the TN29 isolate of tobacco mild green mosaic virus (TMGMV, GenBank accession no. MF139550). To confirm the presence of this virus, sixty above-mentioned samples were screened by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the specific primer pairs (Supplementary Table1) TMGMG-CPF/TMGMG-CPR targeting a 545-nt fragment within the CP gene. Amplicons with expected sizes were detected from 47 of 60 samples but not from the negative control (virus-free healthy plant through the tip meristem culture). Seventeen amplicons (11#, 13#, 14#, 21#, 22#, 23#, 25#, 26#, 27#, 31#, 32#, 33#, 37#, 52#, 57#, 59#, and 60#) of TMGMV-CP were selected, and purified. The PCR products were cloned into the pMD19-T vector (TAKARA Biotech, Dalian, China) and sequenced. The sequences were deposited into the GenBank (accession nos. MZ395944 to MZ395960). The near-full-length genomic sequence of TMGMV-Rg14 isolate was obtained from one positive sample (sample no. 14) by RT-PCR amplification of two overlapping fragments using the following primer pairs: TMGMV-40F/TMGMV-3570R and TMGMV-3220F/TMGMV-6400R. The near-full-length genomic sequence of the TMGMV-Rg14 isolate was 6 304 nucleotides (nt) in length and deposited into GenBank (accession no. MZ395975). BLASTn analysis demonstrated that the TMGMV-Rg14 isolate shared a sequence identity ranging from 96.89% (AB078435) to 99.60% (MF139550) with the other TMGMV isolates. Furthermore, the virus-free healthy R. glutinosa plants were inoculated with sap from the positive sample (14#) to confirm the infection of TMGMV. Mosaic symptoms were induced on the systemically infected leaves of the inoculated plants 14 days post inoculation. The systemically infected leaves of inoculated plants were assayed by RT-PCR using the primer pairs TMGMV-CPF/CPR. Amplicons of expected size were detected from the inoculated plants but not from non-inoculated plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of TMGMV infection on R. glutinosa. Further studies are necessary to select a suitable indicator plant for this TMGMV, its host range, and the symptoms it induces in single infection. Since R. glutinosa is cultivated by vegetative propagation, production of virus-free healthy plants is necessary. This study will help to generate virus-free healthy plants and prevent viral disease on R. glutinosa. Further study is needed to determine its pathological implications and economic impact on R. glutinosa in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Plant Protection, 1 Nongye Road, Zhengzhou, China, 450002; qinyanhong6040@163.com."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "YanHong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; yunfeiren@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; chuantaolu@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Chuantao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhengzhou, Henan, China; 2908778267@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Fengli", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 116 Huayuan Road, Zhengzhou 450002, Henan, China, Zhengzhou, China, 450002; wy412@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; nkyliuyx@163.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yuxia", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; gaosx@126.com."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Suxia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; 15517127870@163.com."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Wenping", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; 731236825@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xuemeng", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhengzhou, China; 15738394561@163.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "17"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["35286130", "10.1094/PDIS-10-21-2283-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
