The tissue localization of the cross-reactive allergen was investigated by immunogold electron microscopy.", "Monoclonal antibody 3A4 recognized IgE epitopes of the 60 kd mugwort allergen and cross-reacted with moieties of comparable molecular weights in birch and timothy grass pollen, as well as in apple and celery extracts. In pollen and plant-derived food the allergen could be localized intracellularly in ribosome-rich areas in the mitochondria and the nucleus. No labeling was observed in the pollen or cell walls or in organelles that are engaged in storage (e.g., starch granules and lipid particles).", "Tree, grass, and weed pollen, as well as plant-derived foods, contain a high molecular weight Art v 1-cross-reactive allergen that maps to similar cell compartments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Physics and Biophysics, University of M\u00fcnster, Germany."}], "LastName": "Grote", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fischer", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "M\u00fcller", "ForeName": "W D", "Initials": "WD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Valenta", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Allergy Clin Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "1275002", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6749"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Epitopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37341-29-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin E"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Epitopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "3", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9500759", "10.1016/S0091-6749(98)70390-2", "S0091-6749(98)70390-2"]}}]}
