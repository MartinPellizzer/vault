This plant has been presumed to be useful in the management of diseases including breast cancer, which is one the commonest cancers affecting women globally. Hence, this study aimed to computationally investigate the phytochemicals present in <i>O. gratissimum</i> by elucidate their binding dynamics against five selected molecular targets of breast cancer and predict their pharmacokinetics properties. Molecular docking, MMGBSA calculation and ADMET prediction were used. The results showed that isovitexin has the highest binding affinity of -9.11\u2009kcal/mol and -9.80\u2009kcal/mol for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) respectively. Rosmarinic acid has the highest binding affinity of -12.15\u2009kcal/mol for Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Nepetoidin A has the highest binding affinity of -9.14\u2009kcal/mol for oestrogen receptor (ER), and Vitexin has the highest binding affinity of -12.90\u2009kcal/mol for Progesterone receptor (PR). MMGBSA provided total binding energy that confirmed the stability of the complexes under physiological conditions. The ADMET profiles showed that <i>O. gratissimum</i> top phytochemicals identified would be safe for oral administration with no hepatoxicity. Overall, this study identified isovitexin, vitexin, rosmarinic acid, nepetoidin A and luteolin among others, as compounds that exhibit strong anti-cancer properties against breast cancer cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytomedicine and Molecular Toxicology Research Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, Federal University Oye-Ekiti, Oye-Ekiti, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ajiboye", "ForeName": "Basiru Olaitan", "Initials": "BO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioinformatics and Enzymology Research Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, Federal University Oye-Ekiti, Oye-Ekiti, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Fatoki", "ForeName": "Toluwase Hezekiah", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioinformatics and Enzymology Research Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, Federal University Oye-Ekiti, Oye-Ekiti, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Akinnusi", "ForeName": "Precious Ayorinde", "Initials": "PA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Redox Biology Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry, Federal University Oye-Ekiti, Oye-Ekiti, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ajuwon", "ForeName": "Olawale Rasaq", "Initials": "OR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytomedicine, Biochemical Toxicology and Biotechnology Research Laboratories, Department of Biochemistry, College of Sciences, Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Structural Biology (BSB) Group, Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Zululand, KwaDlangezwa, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Oyinloye", "ForeName": "Babatunji Emmanuel", "Initials": "BE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemical Immunology and Phytomedicine Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, Federal University Oye-Ekiti, Oye-Ekiti, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Jeje", "ForeName": "Temitope Olawale", "Initials": "TO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Biochemistry Unit, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Owolabi", "ForeName": "Olutunmise Victoria", "Initials": "OV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, Federal University Oye-Ekiti, Oye-Ekiti, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ogedengbe", "ForeName": "Oluwatosin O", "Initials": "OO"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2202-468X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Agriculture and Forestry Systems in the Mediterranean, Catania, Italy."}], "LastName": "Genovese", "ForeName": "Claudia", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38648537", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2344193"]}}]}
