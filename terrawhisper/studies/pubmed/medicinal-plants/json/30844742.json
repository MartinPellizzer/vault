The unique structural diversity of natural products continues to provide opportunities to discover novel compounds. Secondary metabolites, active components of natural products such as marine organisms, microbial organisms and terrestrial plants, are particularly exciting untapped resources for exploration as medicines. Sri Lanka is home to around 3700 plant species, half of which are considered as medicinal plants. Seventy per cent of the Sri Lankan population relies on this plant-based traditional medicine system for treating various illnesses such as tumors. As such these medicinal plant sources should be used to conquer terminal diseases and for prevention of diseases. Sri Lankan researchers have found several plant species that possess cytotoxic activity. This review summarizes the current information regarding the Sri Lankan plant materials that possess anticancer properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Genetics and Research Laboratory, Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Sri Jayawardenepura, Sri Lanka, anchala_k@yahoo.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka."}], "LastName": "Kuruppu", "ForeName": "Anchala", "Initials": "A", "Suffix": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka."}], "LastName": "Paranagama", "ForeName": "Priyani", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Genetics and Research Laboratory, Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Sri Jayawardenepura, Sri Lanka."}], "LastName": "De Silva", "ForeName": "Ranil", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Front Biosci (Schol Ed)", "NlmUniqueID": "101485241", "ISSNLinking": "1945-0516"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aquatic Organisms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interdisciplinary Communication"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sri Lanka"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30844742", "10.2741/S532", "532"]}}]}
