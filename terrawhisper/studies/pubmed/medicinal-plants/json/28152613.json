Soil was sandy in texture and the irrigation system was dripping irrigation. The growth parameters were determined at five successive plant ages, fresh and dry weights of herb were determined at three successive plant ages. The yield of aerial parts after 175\u00a0days, was about 7.5\u00a0Mg/ha. The essential oil (EO) was extracted by hydro-distillation for three hours with a yield of about 0.5% (w/v). The EO of each sample was subjected to gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses to study the chemical composition. The main component of the EO was identified as methyl chavicol which matched over 90% of the whole composition. Chlorophyll a and carotenes increased with increasing plant age in both sites and seasons. Flavonoids decreased with the development of plant age, while the opposite was true with coumarines content."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research , National Research Centre , Giza , Egypt."}], "LastName": "Omer", "ForeName": "Elasyed A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research , National Research Centre , Giza , Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hendawy", "ForeName": "Saber F", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research , National Research Centre , Giza , Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ismail", "ForeName": "Rasha F", "Initials": "RF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy , University of Sassari , Sassari , Italy."}], "LastName": "Petretto", "ForeName": "Giacomo L", "Initials": "GL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Chemistry , University of Warwick , Coventry , UK."}], "LastName": "Rourke", "ForeName": "Jonathan P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy , University of Sassari , Sassari , Italy."}], "LastName": "Pintore", "ForeName": "Giorgio", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allylbenzene Derivatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anisoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Carotenoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9NIW07V3ET", "NameOfSubstance": "estragole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YF5Q9EJC8Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acclimatization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allylbenzene Derivatives"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Anisoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carotenoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Distillation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Egypt"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Tagetes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28152613", "10.1080/14786419.2017.1278594"]}}]}
