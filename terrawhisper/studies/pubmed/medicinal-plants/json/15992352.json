In recent years, the anti-cancer property of various SLs has attracted a great deal of interest and extensive research work has been carried out to characterize the anti-cancer activity, the molecular mechanisms, and the potential chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic application of SLs. In this review, we attempt to summarize the current knowledge of the anti-cancer properties of SLs by focusing on the following important issues. First, we discuss the structure-activity relationship of SLs. All SLs contain a common functional structure, an alpha-methylene-gamma-lactone group, and this important chemical characteristic means that the thiol-reactivity of SLs is an underlying mechanism responsible for their bioactivities. Second, we assess the experimental evidence for the anti-cancer function of SLs obtained from both in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal models. Various SLs have been demonstrated to execute their anti-cancer capability via inhibition of inflammatory responses, prevention of metastasis and induction of apoptosis. Thirdly, we outline the molecular mechanisms involved in the anti-cancer activity of SLs, in particular, the SL-thiols reaction, the effect of SLs on cell signaling pathways such as nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Finally, we recapitulate some important SLs with regards to their anti-cancer activities and their potential in anti-cancer drug development. Taken together, many SLs are emerging as promising anti-cancer agents with potential applications in both cancer chemotherapy and chemoprevention."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community, Occupational and Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Republic of Singapore."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Siyuan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Won", "ForeName": "Yen-Kim", "Initials": "YK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ong", "ForeName": "Choon-Nam", "Initials": "CN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Han-Ming", "Initials": "HM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem Anticancer Agents", "NlmUniqueID": "101123597", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0118"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Lactones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}], "NumberOfReferences": "116"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15992352", "10.2174/1568011053765976"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
