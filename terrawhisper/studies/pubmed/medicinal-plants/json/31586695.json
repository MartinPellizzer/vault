The standard sample was prepared and transcriptional reporters for quorum sensing systems were constructed. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to clarify the mechanism. GC-MS and molecular docking were used to identify the chemicals in MHE and potential binding agents.", "We found that co-culturing of MHE with bacterial cells did not change the growth rate but substantially attenuate the production of virulence factors such as phenazine pyocyanin, siderophore pyoverdine and biofilm formation. Transcriptional responses of three major quorum sensing (QS) systems of P. aeruginosa to MHE showed that Pseudomonas quinolone signaling (PQS) system was completely repressed, rhlR/rhlI QS system was moderately inhibited, while lasR/lasI QS system was only slightly affected, suggesting that MHE might selectively target the PQS system to inhibit bacterial virulence. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) showed that MHE inhibited the binding of MvfR the corresponding pqsA promoter region, suggesting that MHE serves as a competitive agent to quench the QS functionality in P. aeruginosa.", "We prove that MHE functions as an effective countermeasure against bacterial infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
