Although various treatment options are available to treat heart failure, death rates in both men and women remain high. Potential adjunctive therapies may lie with use of herbal medications, many of which possess potent pharmacological properties. Among the most widely studied is ginseng, a member of the genus Panax that is grown in many parts of the world and that has been used as a medical treatment for a variety of conditions for thousands of years, particularly in Asian societies. There are a number of ginseng species, each possessing distinct pharmacological effects due primarily to differences in their bioactive components including saponin ginsenosides and polysaccharides. While experimental evidence for salutary effects of ginseng on heart failure is robust, clinical evidence is less so, primarily due to a paucity of large-scale well-controlled clinical trials. However, there is evidence from small trials that ginseng-containing Chinese medications such as Shenmai can offer benefit when administered as adjunctive therapy to heart failure patients. Substantial additional studies are required, particularly in the clinical arena, to provide evidence for a favourable effect of ginseng in heart failure patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "London, Ontario, Canada."}], "LastName": "Karmazyn", "ForeName": "Morris", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "London, Ontario, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "London, Ontario, Canada."}], "LastName": "Gan", "ForeName": "Xiaohong Tracey", "Initials": "XT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372712", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4212"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiovascular Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiomegaly"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Failure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28505464", "10.1139/cjpp-2017-0092"]}}]}
