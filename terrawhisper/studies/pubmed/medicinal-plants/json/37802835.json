As high as 87.6% of roots or rhizomes of Chinese medicinal materials are susceptible to root rot, which seriously affects the cultivation development of Chinese medicinal materials. Trichoderma fungi, possessing biological control functions, can induce plants to improve their resistance to microbial diseases, promote plant growth, and effectively reduce the losses caused by various microbial diseases on cultivation. At present, Trichoderma is rarely used in the cultivation of Chinese medicinal materials, so it has great application potential for the prevention and control of root rot diseases in farmed Chinese medicinal materials. Based on the above situation, after comparison and discussion, it is believed that compared with chemical control and physical control, biological control of root rot diseases of Chinese medicinal materials is more efficient and meets the development needs of Chinese medicinal materials ecological planting in China. This paper reviewed the progress in the research and application of Trichoderma in the control of root rot diseases in the root and rhizome of farmed Chinese medicinal materials in the past 10 years and found that most of the current research on the biological control of root rot diseases in Chinese medicinal materials was mostly limited to the verification of the inhibitory effect of Trichoderma strains on the growth of the pathogenic microbes. Studies on the induction effect of Trichoderma on Chinese medicinal materials are not in depth. Studies on the responding mechanisms of most Chinese medicinal materials to Trichoderma are highly absent. Moreover, there are few reports on field experiments, which indicates that there is a long way to go before Trichoderma is widely applied in the farming practice of Chinese medicinal materials. To sum up, this paper aimed to link the present and the future and advocated further relevant research and more experiments on the application of Trichoderma in the farming of Chinese medicinal materials."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China School of Traditional Chinese Medicine,Guangdong Pharmaceutical University Guangzhou 510006, China Key Laboratory of Biology and Cultivation of Herb Medicine, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Kuo", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China Key Laboratory of Biology and Cultivation of Herb Medicine, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Yang", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China Key Laboratory of Biology and Cultivation of Herb Medicine, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Xiu-Zhi", "Initials": "XZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China Key Laboratory of Biology and Cultivation of Herb Medicine, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Cheng-Cai", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China Key Laboratory of Biology and Cultivation of Herb Medicine, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yue-Feng", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China School of Traditional Chinese Medicine,Guangdong Pharmaceutical University Guangzhou 510006, China Key Laboratory of Biology and Cultivation of Herb Medicine, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Farms"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trichoderma"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37802835", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20230515.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
