They are often perceived as being \"natural\" and therefore harmless, devoid of side effects, and without unpleasant consequences. The fact is that although their risks might be less than those of conventional drugs, side effects of this therapy can and do occur and must be considered as being a relevant factor in using such methods. It is to be expected that their numbers will increase in the future because of their growing popularity and because of continuing efforts to intensify their activity and therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, now more than ever, dermatologists should be familiar with all possible side effects, risks, and toxic, allergic, and possible mutagenic reactions. This article provides fundamental and vital information for practicing dermatologists."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dermatology Unit, Kaplan Medical Center, Rechovot, Israel."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mevorah", "ForeName": "Baruch", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Orion", "ForeName": "Edith", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matz", "ForeName": "Hagit", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolf", "ForeName": "Ronni", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Dermatol Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "9700070", "ISSNLinking": "1396-0296"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Eruptions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Homeopathy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "37"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12919116", "10.1046/j.1529-8019.2003.01623.x", "01623"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
