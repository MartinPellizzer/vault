Seeds germination conditions were probed into under the national test regulations for crop seeds and related prescription from international standards.", "(1) There was a layer of slime about 10-20 microm thickness covering epicarp of Danshen seeds. The slime formed as diamond meshwork (reseau) and the weight of it was 8%-10% of total seeds weight. (2) The speed of water absorption of seeds was extremely rapid. The weight of seeds could increase above 10 times as original while the dehydration velocity was quite low. (3) The optimal temperature for the seeds germination is around 25 degrees C, and the germination rate of the new seeds gained yearly was above 75%, but the rate would decrease sharply as years went by. It was also found that the seeds germination power and exponent of vigor were quite high under the temperature transformation between 23 degrees C, 28 degrees C. Such treatments as pre-cool, PEG treatment and infusing with GA3 could increase the rate of seeds germination capacity obviously."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northwest Sci-Tech University of Agriculture and Forestry, Yangling 712100, China. sunqunsci@tom.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Qun", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Zong-suo", "Initials": "ZS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shao-jun", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wen-ting", "Initials": "WT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao-Li", "Initials": "XL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Chuan-zhong", "Initials": "CZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jing-min", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Xin-rong", "Initials": "XR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15631074"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
