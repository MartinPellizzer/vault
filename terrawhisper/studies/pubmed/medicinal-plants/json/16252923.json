The compounds were tested for inhibition of COX-1 activity. The aglycon 5, obtained by acid hydrolysis of 1, was equally effective as phloroglucinol, with an IC(50) of 3.8 microM. The inhibitory potential of the glucosides was 1>2>3 and decreased with increasing length of the acyl side chain. Compound 4 was about 2.5-fold less active than 1 (IC(50): 23.7 and 58.7 microM, respectively)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fr. 8.2 Pharmakognosie und Analytische Phytochemie der Universit\u00e4t des Saarlandes, D-66041 Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bohr", "ForeName": "Gregor", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gerh\u00e4user", "ForeName": "Clarissa", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Knauft", "ForeName": "Jutta", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zapp", "ForeName": "Josef", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Becker", "ForeName": "Hans", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DHD7FFG6YS", "NameOfSubstance": "Phloroglucinol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 1"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Humulus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phloroglucinol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16252923", "10.1021/np050164z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
