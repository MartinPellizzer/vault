Higher concentration of heavy metals decreased shoot dry weight in <i>Baft</i> (7.05%) and <i>Ramjerd</i> (43.34%) than control. Root dry weight increased in mycorrhizal <i>Baft</i> (28.23%) and <i>Ramjerd</i> (31.84%) ecotypes under H2 than non-mycorrhizal plants. In mycorrhizal plants, root colonization percentage decreased 37.07% in H2 than control. Increasing heavy metals concentration led to increase of total antioxidant activity and total phenol content. Mycorrhizal <i>Ramjerd</i> showed the lowest shoot Pb concentration in both heavy metals concentrations and the highest root Pb concentration (107.25% higher than non-mycoorhizal one) in H2. For both ecotypes, the lowest shoot Cd concentration observed in mycorrhizal plants under H1 and mycorrhizal plants had more root Cd concentration (33.83\u2009mg kg<sup>-1\u2009</sup>dry matter) than non-mycorrhizal ones. In both concentrations of heavy metals, the lowest Pb (0.026) and Cd (0.153) translocation factor (TF) observed in mycorrhizal plants. Based on the results, licorice with TF< 1 is not a hyperaccumulator plant but stabilizes Cd and Pb in root. <b>Novelty statement:</b> Licorice is a well-known medicinal plant that its root and rhizome contains diverse applications in pharmaceutical and food industries. The main source of licorice supply is through harvesting from natural habitats of Iran (one of the first exporters of licorice in the world), which during the last years have been exposed to heavy metals contamination. Therefore, the growth response of the plant in polluted habitats and most importantly, the concentration of heavy metals especially in belowground parts of the plant need more consideration. Hence, this research was carried out with an objective to investigate growth and yield potential response of two ecotypes of licorice to mycorhization under heavy metal stress (Cd and Pb) and the mechanism of heavy metal management in above and belowground parts of licorice in order to achieve its potential for further sustainable phytoremediation programs and most importantly considering the heavy metal accumulation in rhizomes and roots in accordance with world standards for medicinal and edible consumption."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science and Landscape Engineering, Faculty of Agricultural Science and Engineering, College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Tehran, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tabrizi", "ForeName": "Leila", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science and Landscape Engineering, Faculty of Agricultural Science and Engineering, College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Tehran, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Lakzaei", "ForeName": "Mahdiyeh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Soil Science Engineering, Faculty of Agricultural Engineering and Technology, College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Tehran, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Motesharezadeh", "ForeName": "Babak", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Phytoremediation", "NlmUniqueID": "101136878", "ISSNLinking": "1522-6514"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "7"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32898452", "10.1080/15226514.2020.1813076"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
