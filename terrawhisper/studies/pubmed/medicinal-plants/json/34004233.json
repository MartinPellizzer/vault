Computational Research in 21st century is giving more attention to medicinal plants for new drug design as pharmacological screening of bioactive compound was time consuming and expensive. Computational methods such as Molecular Docking, Molecular Dynamic Simulation and Artificial intelligence are significant Insilico tools in medicinal plant research. Molecular docking approach exploits the mechanism of potential phytochemicals into the target active site to elucidate its interactions and biological therapeutic properties. MD simulation illuminates the dynamic behavior of biomolecules at atomic level with fine quality representation of biomolecules. Dramatical advancement in computer science is illustrating the biological mechanism via these tools in different diseases treatment. The advancement comprises speed, the system configuration, and other software upgradation to insights into the structural explanation and optimization of biomolecules. A probable shift from simulation to artificial intelligence has in fact accelerated the art of scientific study to a sky high. The most upgraded algorithm in artificial intelligence such as Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, Neuro-fuzzy Logic has provided a wide opportunity in easing the time required in classical experimental strategy. The notable progress in computer science technology has paved a pathway for understanding the pharmacological functions and creating a roadmap for drug design and development and other achievement in the field of medicinal plants research. This review focus on the development and overview in computational research moving from static molecular docking method to a range of dynamic simulation and an advanced artificial intelligence such as machine learning."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
