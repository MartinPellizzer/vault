With the emergence of problems, such as increasing demand for HMs and shortage of resources, it often occurs the phenomenon of shoddy exceed and mixing the false with the genuine in the market. There is an urgent need to evaluate the quality of HMs to ensure their important role in health care and disease treatment, and to reduce the possibility of threat to human health. Modern analytical technology is can be analyzed for analyzing chemical components of HMs or their preparations. Reflecting complex chemical components' characteristic curves in the analysis sample, and the comprehensive effect of active ingredients of HMs. In this review, modern analytical technology (chromatography, spectroscopy, mass spectrometry), chemometrics methods (unsupervised, supervised) and their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability were introduced and summarized. In addition, the authentication application of modern analytical technology combined with chemometrics methods in four aspects, including origin, processing methods, cultivation methods, and adulteration of HMs have also been discussed and illustrated by a few typical studies. This article offers a general workflow of analytical methods that have been applied for HMs authentication and explains that the accuracy of authentication in favor of the quality assurance of HMs. It was provided reference value for the development and application of modern HMs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chunlu", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Zuo", "ForeName": "Zhitian", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Furong", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuanzhong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9004784", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8347"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemometrics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "35"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34991387", "10.1080/10408347.2021.2023460", "10.1080/10408347.2021.2023460"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
