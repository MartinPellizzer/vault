Intact sperm were evaluated before the acrosome reaction (AR), and a soluble form of PH-20 released during acrosomal exocytosis was also investigated. Western blots of SDS-PAGE of acrosome-intact sperm extracts revealed a 64-kDa form of PH-20 was recognized by a polyclonal antibody (R-10) raised in rabbits against purified, recombinant cynomolgus macaque sperm PH-20. The soluble components released during the AR which were recognized by the R-10 antibody included both the 64-kDa form and a 53-kDa form of PH-20. An ELISA-like procedure for determining PH-20 hyaluronidase activity indicated that acrosome-intact sperm exhibited two peaks of hyaluronidase activity near pH 4 and > or = pH 7. The majority of enzyme activity in acrosome-intact sperm extracts occurred at neutral pH, while the soluble hyaluronidase activity released at the AR was predominantly acid-active. Hyaluronidase activity of PH-20 at different pH optima was investigated using hyaluronic acid substrate gel electrophoresis, and results indicated that the 64-kDa polypeptide had a broad range, with the majority of activity at neutral pH (pH 7). The 53-kDa polypeptide in sperm extracts only exhibited activity at acid pH (pH 4). The hyaluronidase activities of both enzymes could be inhibited by apigenin. The soluble PH-20 hyaluronidase activity released during the AR was primarily of the acid-active 53-kDa form. Fine structural localization of PH-20 using Fab fragments of R-10 IgG demonstrated that PH-20 was associated not only with sperm membranes, but also with the dispersing acrosomal contents. These data suggest that the more neutral-active form of PH-20 (64 kDa) is present on the plasma and inner acrosomal membranes and gives rise to the soluble acid-active form at the time of the AR. The generation of the soluble form of PH-20 may result from the action of acrosomal enzymes, which could include proteases, glycosidases, and phospholipases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Toxicology, University of California, Davis, 95616 USA."}], "LastName": "Cherr", "ForeName": "G N", "Initials": "GN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Meyers", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yudin", "ForeName": "A I", "Initials": "AI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "VandeVoort", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Myles", "ForeName": "D G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Primakoff", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Overstreet", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P51-RR00169", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "U54-HD29125", "Acronym": "HD", "Agency": "NICHD NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Dev Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372762", "ISSNLinking": "0012-1606"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cell Adhesion Molecules"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.35", "NameOfSubstance": "Hyaluronoglucosaminidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.35", "NameOfSubstance": "hyaluronidase PH-20"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Acrosome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Adhesion Molecules"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Compartmentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chamomile"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Hyaluronoglucosaminidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macaca fascicularis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Immunoelectron"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sperm Capacitation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatozoa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8608861", "10.1006/dbio.1996.0102", "S0012-1606(96)90102-5"]}}]}
