At present, the prevention and control of pests and diseases is mainly carried out through chemical pesticides, and the consequent pesticide residues of P. notoginseng have attracted much attention. This study reviewed the types and detection methods of pesticide residues in P. notoginseng from 1981 to 2021, and compared the limits of pesticide residues in P. notoginseng in China and abroad to provide a reference for rational application of pesticides in P. notoginseng and quality control of medicinal materials, thereby promoting the sustainable development of the P. notoginseng industry in China. Currently, there are only 40 published papers on pesticide residues of P. notoginseng, which is indicative of a serious problem of insufficient research. At present, hundreds of pesticide residues in P. notoginseng can be detected simultaneously by using chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The pesticides detected have gradually changed from early prohibited ones, such as dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane(DDT), benzene hexachloride(BHC), and parathion, to low toxic ones(e.g., dimethomorph, procymidone, propicona-zole, and difenoconazole). The dietary risk from pesticide residues in P. notoginseng is low, which would not cause harm to consu-mers. This study concluded that in the future, the development of the quality standard for pesticide residues of P. notoginseng should be actively carried out. To increase the pesticides used in actual production in the quality standard based on the existing ones and to guide farmers to use pesticides scientifically will be the focus of future work."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology Kunming 650050, China Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Panax notoginseng Kunming 650050, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology Kunming 650050, China Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Panax notoginseng Kunming 650050, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Cheng-Xiao", "Initials": "CX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology Kunming 650050, China Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Panax notoginseng Kunming 650050, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Analysis and Testing Center, Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Sciences) Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Special Product Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Changchun 130112, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ya-Yu", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology Kunming 650050, China Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Panax notoginseng Kunming 650050, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Xiu-Ming", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology Kunming 650050, China Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Panax notoginseng Kunming 650050, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax notoginseng"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "51"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35347941", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20211221.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
