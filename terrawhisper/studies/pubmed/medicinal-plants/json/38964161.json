Chromatographic fingerprints with solvent gradients authenticate and categorise medicinal plants by capturing chemical diversity. This work focuses on optimising tea sample analysis in HPLC, using a model-based approach without requiring standards. Predicting the gradient profile effects on full signals was the basis to identify optimal separation conditions. Global models characterised retention and bandwidth for 14 peaks in the chromatograms across varied elution conditions, facilitating resolution optimisation of 63 peaks, covering 99.95 % of total peak area. The identified optimal gradient was applied to classify 40 samples representing six tea varieties. Matrices of baseline-corrected signals, elution bands, and band ratios, were evaluated to select the best dataset. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), k-means clustering, and Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) assessed classification feasibility. Classification limitations were found reasonable due to tea processing complexities, involving drying and fermentation influenced by environmental conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
