However, there are still some puzzles and misunderstandings about Daodi CMM to be treated with seriously. The main research aspects of Daodi CMM in the future could be focused on: (1) Identification and authentication of the species and producing area of Daodi CMM. (2) Establishment and implement of the commercial specification criterion of Daodi CMM.
