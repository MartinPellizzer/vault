Samples were collected over 20 min and analysed for N-nitrosoproline (NPRO), tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNA) and areca nut-specific nitrosamines using gas chromatography-thermal energy analysis, arecoline and nicotine using gas chromatography-nitrogen phosphorus-specific detector, and for nitrite and thiocyanate. When results were expressed as a ratio of NPRO (ng/ml) to nicotine (micrograms/ml), all BQT chewers had increased NPRO contents after chewing BQT with proline. For BQ chewers, when the results were expressed as a ratio of NPRO (ng/ml) to arecoline (micrograms/ml), a similar increase in NPRO content was observed. However, the presence of ascorbic acid inhibited the increased nitrosation in only four out of ten BQT chewers and in five out of ten BQ chewers; in the rest of the samples, its presence enhanced the levels of NPRO. N'-Nitrosoanatabine (NAT) and N-nitrosoguvacoline (NGCO) levels decreased significantly in saliva of chewers of BQT in the presence of ascorbic acid, suggesting inhibition of their formation. In-vitro nitrosation of BQT/BQ with proline and proline plus ascorbic acid showed a similar pattern of nitrosation at salivary pH. The study confirmed previous results that certain nitrosamines are formed during the chewing of BQT/BQ."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Environmental Carcinogens and Host Factors, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France."}], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "U J", "Initials": "UJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ohshima", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bhide", "ForeName": "S V", "Initials": "SV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bartsch", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "IARC Sci Publ", "NlmUniqueID": "8009542", "ISSNLinking": "0300-5038"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitroso Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9DLQ4CIU6V", "NameOfSubstance": "Proline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Nitroso Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Proline"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Saliva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco, Smokeless"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3679424"]}}]}
