Some beneficial bacteria help plant tolerance to many hazardous chemical elements. In this context, Cupriavidus basilensis , Novosphingobium humi , Bacillus zanthoxyli , Bacillus sp., Paenibacillus alvei , Ancylobacter aquaticus and Ralstonia syzygii metal-tolerant rhizospheric bacteria were isolated from rhizospheric soil associated with Bacopa monnieri . The beneficial effects of rhizospheric bacteria on B. monnieri plant physiology and biochemical responses were investigated under pot conditions at two levels (100\u03bcM and 500\u03bcM) of CuSO4 or FeCl3 . N. humi , A. aquaticus and R. syzygii bacterial strains were associated with significantly increased height and biomass under normal and stress conditions. An assay for indole acetic acid in isolated rhizospheric bacteria found differential secretion except Bacillus zanthoxyli . Bacoside A is a major phytocompound in B. monnieri with medicinal value; maximum induction was observed in the R. syzygii treatment. High concentration of copper and iron salts negatively influenced height, biomass and photosynthetic pigments; however N. humi , A. aquaticus , Bacilllus sp. and R. syzygii beneficial bacterial helped plants under stress conditions. Moreover, a significant enhancement in chlorophyll a and b was noticed in C. basilensis , B. zanthoxyli , Bacilllus sp., P. alvei and R. syzygii treatments, without much influence on carotenoid levels. Therefore, the present study emphasises the importance of isolating plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria for use in bacopa plants exposed to metals such as copper and iron in soil."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Allied Health Sciences, REVA University, Bangalore 560064, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Kushwaha", "ForeName": "Ramesh Kumar", "Initials": "RK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Allied Health Sciences, REVA University, Bangalore 560064, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Joshi", "ForeName": "Samyukta Madhav", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Allied Health Sciences, REVA University, Bangalore 560064, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Bajaj", "ForeName": "Renuka", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbial Technology Laboratory, CSIR (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research)-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Center, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Mastan", "ForeName": "Anthati", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Genetic Resources and Improvement Division, CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow 226001, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Vinay", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences, 53 University Road, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Himani", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Allied Health Sciences, REVA University, Bangalore 560064, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Jayashree", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dravyagun, IMS (Institute of Medical Sciences), Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Chaudhary", "ForeName": "Satya Prakash", "Initials": "SP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Funct Plant Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101154361", "ISSNLinking": "1445-4416"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "bacoside A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YF5Q9EJC8Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bacopa"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gallionellaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "41"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37045602", "10.1071/FP22263", "FP22263"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
