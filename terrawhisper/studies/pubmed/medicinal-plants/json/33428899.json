Discovery of novel therapeutic agents has crucial importance for improvement of our medical management capabilities. Dysregulation of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase pathway plays an important role in cancer progression, making this receptor an attractive molecular target for anticancer drug discovery. In this study, twenty-seven 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-one C5 amide derivatives were synthesized and their cancer cell growth inhibitory activity was examined against MCF-7, HT-29 and MOLT-4\u00a0cells and also NIH/3T3 non-cancer cells by MTT assay. The antiproliferative effect of the most potent derivatives were tested against MET-dependent EBC-1 and MKN-45, lung and gastric cancer cell lines, respectively. MET kinase inhibition was measured by a Homogenous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) Assay. The influence of the test compounds on cell cycle was examined by RNase/PI flow cytometric assay. A number of compounds exhibited considerable antiproliferative effects against breast and colon cancer and leukemia cell lines, relatively sparing non-cancer cells. Some derivatives bearing benzothiazolyl carboxamide moiety at C5 position (15, 21, 23, 31, and 37) showed the highest activities with IC<sub>50</sub> values as low as 10.9\u00a0\u03bcM. These compounds showed antiproliferative effects also against MET-amplified cells and dose-dependently inhibited MET kinase activity. They also induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest at lower doses and apoptosis at higher doses. Molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies confirmed the interaction of compound 23 with the active site of the MET receptor. These findings demonstrate that 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-one analogues may represent promising targeted anticancer agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
