Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors are used for the management of AD. In our ongoing research to search for natural AChE inhibitors from medicinal plants, we found that the Acorus calamus possesses memory-enhancing properties. \u03b1-Asarone is the major compound isolated from the Acorus calamus and it has neuroprotective action in animal models, nonetheless, its anticholinesterase activity in different brain regions was not fully understood. The purpose of this research was to determine the anti-amnesic and anti-cholinesterase activities of \u03b1-asarone against scopolamine-induced memory impairments in rats.", "The anti-cholinesterase activity of \u03b1-asarone was determined using Ellman's method in different brain areas, such as the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. In addition, the anti-amnesic effect of \u03b1-asarone was also investigated using elevated plus-maze, passive avoidance, and active avoidance tests.", "The effect of \u03b1-asarone on memory impairment against scopolamine-induced (1 mg/kg body weight) amnesia was evaluated. Administration of \u03b1-asarone (15 and 30 mg/kg body weight) for 14 days to rats significantly ameliorated the scopolamine-induced memory impairment as measured in the elevated plus-maze, passive avoidance, and avoidance active tests compared to the scopolamine-treated group. In this study, we also show that \u03b1-asarone treatment significantly (p<0.05) reduced brain acetylcholinesterase activity in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum brain regions of amnesic rats.", "These results confirmed that \u03b1-asarone has anti-amnesic and anti-cholinesterase potential which may be useful for the management of AD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, King Khalid University, Abha, Saudi Arabia. kumarve@kku.edu.sa."}], "LastName": "Venkatesan", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9717360", "ISSNLinking": "1128-3602"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allylbenzene Derivatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anisoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "asarone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DL48G20X8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Scopolamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N9YNS0M02X", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholine"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2023 Apr;27(8):3218. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_202304_32182", "PMID": "37140272"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Allylbenzene Derivatives"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Amnesia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anisoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Avoidance Learning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maze Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Memory Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Scopolamine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36111936", "10.26355/eurrev_202209_29660", "29660"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
