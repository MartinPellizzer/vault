In anesthetized rats, both histamine derivatives produced transient hypotension mediated via H1-histaminergic receptors and in the case of N,N-dimethylhistamine, via nitric oxide release. Synephrine acetonide produced transient hypertension and tachycardia, mediated via alpha- and alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptores, respectively. The chromatographic zone containing N-methyproline, proline and gamma-aminobutyric acid elicited marked and prolonged hypotension. Finally, casimiroedine did not modify the blood pressure of anesthetized rats, but lowered it persistently in anesthetized guinea pigs. It was concluded that hypotension produced by C. edulis is due to several active components. The immediate effect can be attributed to the histamine derivatives acting on H1-receptors. More prolonged hypotension would be produced by the mixture of amino acids through an unknown mechanism, as well as by casimiroedine, possibly by activation of H3-receptors. Hypotension is partially offset by synephrine acetonide through adrenergic mechanisms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, National University of Mexico, DF, Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Magos", "ForeName": "G A", "Initials": "GA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vidrio", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reynolds", "ForeName": "W F", "Initials": "WF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Enr\u00edquez", "ForeName": "R G", "Initials": "RG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylhistamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nucleosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5853-02-1", "NameOfSubstance": "casimiroedine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "820484N8I3", "NameOfSubstance": "Histamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PEG5DP7434", "NameOfSubstance": "Synephrine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Methylhistamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nucleosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Synephrine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10075120", "10.1016/s0378-8741(98)00101-9", "S0378874198001019"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
