The dietetic materia medica then became a knowledge system in Japan with reference of the knowledge system of traditional Chinese materia medica, following some related books published.<i>Dietetic Materia Medica (Yue Fu Shi Wu Ben Cao)</i> was written by Nagoya Genyi as the pioneer work on dietetic materia medica in the Edo period. The book was divided into two volumes. The first one involved a total of 290 types of dietetic materia medica and 167 types of botanical medicines (grains, vegetables, aquatic plants, fungi, fruits, and herbs). The second volume included 123 types of animal medicines (fish,meso, poultry and animal sections). Its author, Nagoya Genyi, was the first doctor to link food with clinical treatment in Japan. He mainly focused on disease treatment in terms of specific classification and exposition. In this sense, the book was characteristic of materia medica rather than its museum properties. The content of the book showed the writing style and the medical tendency of the early food materia medica in the Edo period. Researching this book can help in understanding the compilation of dietetic materia medica represented by physicians in this period in Japan."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Science and Technology Humanities, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Traditional Chinese Medicine Inheritance Research Center,Shanghai Literature Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200020,China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "18YJCZH269", "Agency": "Ministry of Education Humanities and Social Sciences Research Youth Fund Project", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2021WK134", "Agency": "Budgeted projects in Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Yi Shi Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8303081", "ISSNLinking": "0255-7053"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Books"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "50"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37474333", "10.3760/cma.j.cn112155-20220425-00049"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
