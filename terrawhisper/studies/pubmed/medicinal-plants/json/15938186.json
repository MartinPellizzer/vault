To obtain good resolution within a short time, stepwise gradient elution of CEC was employed, and the effects of experimental parameters, such as the buffer, the gradient conditions, and the mode of injection were studied systematically. Under optimized conditions, analysis could be accomplished in 25 min on a monolithic rod of macroporous poly(butyl methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate). With two identified flavonoids, epicatechin and apigenin, as markers, a quality control method for Shiyacha and its relevant products was established. The calibration curves exhibited good linear behavior over the concentration range of two orders of magnitude. On combination with an on-line concentration technique, the detection limit of flavonoids could be decreased to 25 ng for apigenin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Chromatographic Research & Analysis Center, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116023, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lingyi", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lihua", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Weibing", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yukui", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Sep Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101088554", "ISSNLinking": "1615-9306"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7V515PI7F6", "NameOfSubstance": "Apigenin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8R1V1STN48", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Apigenin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Catechin"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Micellar Electrokinetic Capillary"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15938186", "10.1002/jssc.200400080"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
