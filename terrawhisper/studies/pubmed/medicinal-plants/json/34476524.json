(P. vulgaris). Their molecular scaffolds comprise different hydroxylation and degree of esterification. Vulgarisins have attracted many attentions in the fields of food and medicine for their potent bioactivities. Firstly, four reference compounds were analyzed by higher-energy collisional dissociation mass spectrometry (HCD MS/MS) and the fragmentation patterns for molecular scaffold were summarized. And then, a high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-HR-MS) method was adopted to investigate the P. vulgaris extracts. Finally, the proposed analysis results were successfully applied to facilitate the discovery of the vulgarisins analogues from P. vulgaris. For the four reference compounds, the sodium adduct was the predominate ion in full scan. A specific fragmentation pathway of [M+Na]<sup>+</sup> ions leads to produce diagnostic ions of vulgarisins at m/z 325 under HCD, which was formed through consecutive-side chains lost. Twenty-three diterpenoids, including 18 vulgarisins analogues, were identified or tentatively characterized in the botanical extracts of P. vulgaris based on their elemental constituents and characteristic fragment ion profiles. Two new vulgarisins analogues in the plant were isolated and their structures were illustrated based on extensive spectroscopic analysis using <sup>1</sup>D and <sup>2</sup>D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The HCD MS/MS method, including the profiles of the diagnostic ions induced by characteristic fragmentation, is an effective technique for the discovery of vulgarisins analogues in P. vulgaris. The expected fragmentation pattern knowledge will also facilitate the analysis of other natural products."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021.
