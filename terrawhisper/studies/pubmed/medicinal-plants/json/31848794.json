However, in planta delivery of the two core GE components, Cas9 and small guide RNA (sgRNA), often involves time-consuming and labor-intensive production of transgenic plants. Here we show that Foxtail mosaic virus, a monocot- and dicot-infecting potexvirus, can simultaneously express Cas9, sgRNA, and an RNAi suppressor to efficiently induce GE in Nicotiana benthamiana through a transgenic plant-free manner."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Plant RNA Signaling and Zhejiang Provincial Key
