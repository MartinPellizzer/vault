Endomyocardial biopsies were performed in 32 subjects. Results from six were normal. Ventricular failure in the other 26 was idiopathic (n = 15), familial (n = 3), alcohol induced (n = 5), or related to doxorubicin therapy (n = 3). The biopsies were analyzed for total, mitochondrial, Na+-K+, Ca++, and Mg++ ATPase activities. Total and mitochondrial ATPase activities correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.65 and 0.67, respectively; both p = 0.0001). Residual Mg++ ATPase activity correlated weakly with ventricular function as measured by echocardiography (p = 0.05). Na+-K+ ATPase activity was depressed in patients receiving digitalis (p = 0.01). These results suggest that progressive ventricular dysfunction may be associated with a progressive loss of total ATPase, mitochondrial ATPase and, to a lesser extent, Mg++ ATPase activity. Although depressed mitochondrial ATPase activity is not likely to be the primary cause of ventricular dysfunction, it could perpetuate failure by leading to inadequate production of adenosine triphosphate. Further study of ATPase activities may provide additional insight into the pathogenesis of cardiac failure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus 43210."}], "LastName": "Unverferth", "ForeName": "D V", "Initials": "DV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "S W", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wallick", "ForeName": "E T", "Initials": "ET"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01-HU-22619", "Agency": "PHS HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am Heart J", "NlmUniqueID": "0370465", "ISSNLinking": "0002-8703"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphatases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 7.2.2.10", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium-Transporting ATPases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 7.2.2.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphatases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium-Transporting ATPases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiomyopathy, Dilated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Endocardium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria, Heart"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2827453", "10.1016/0002-8703(88)90529-7", "0002-8703(88)90529-7"]}}]}
