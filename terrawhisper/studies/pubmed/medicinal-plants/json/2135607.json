The effect of Sunphenon on cariogenic Streptococcus mutans groups (serotype c and g) was studied in both in vitro and in vivo. The summary of results were described as follows; 1) Addition of Sunphenon to S. mutans JC-2 (c) caused a decrease in cell viability. The activity of Sunphenon showed that multiple application are required for killing and maximum effect was seen between 60 and 90 min treatment. However, treatment of S. mutans with Sunphenon did not induce complete cell death after 90 min incubation. 2) When S. mutans JC-2 (c) was pretreated with Sunphenon, the cellular attachment on saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surface was significantly reduced. 3) When saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surface was pretreated with Sunphenon, the cellular attachment of S. mutans JC-2 (c) was also markedly inhibited. 4) Sunphenon had no inhibitory effect on lactic acid production by S. mutans JC-2 (c). 5) Sunphenon showed a strong inhibitory effect against water-insoluble glucan synthesis by glucosyltransferase from S. mutans JC-2 (c) or S. sobrinus 6715 (g). 6) specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans JC-2 (c) and fed a cariogenic diet containing 0.5%. Sunphenon developed significantly fewer carious lesions than controls infected with S. mutans and fed the same diet without Sunphenon. Furthermore, feeding of the drinking water containing 0.1% Sunphenon reduced caries incident in S. mutans in infected animals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pathology, Nihon University School of Dentistry at Matsudo."}], "LastName": "Saito", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nichidai Koko Kagaku", "NlmUniqueID": "9425106", "ISSNLinking": "0385-0145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cariostatic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyapatites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "131258-00-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Sunphenon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cariostatic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Caries"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Glucans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyapatites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Streptococcus mutans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2135607"]}}]}
