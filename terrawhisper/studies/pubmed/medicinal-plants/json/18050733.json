U937 cells were cultured with different concentrations of GbE (0.1, 1, and 10 microg x L(-1)), and stimulated by 100 mg x L(-1) oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) for 24 h. The expressions of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in culture solution were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results showed that incubated with 100 mg x L(-1) ox-LDL for 24 h, the U937 cells became foam cells, the protein or mRNA expressions of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-10, and its receptor IL-10R in U937 foam cells were higher markedly than those in normal U937 cells. When the cells were pretreated with GbE (0.1, 1, and 10 microg x L(-1)), the increases of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in U937 foam cells were remarkably inhibited, but IL-10 expression increased greatly. Especially when cells were pretreated with 10 microg x L(-1) GbE, the protein and mRNA expressions of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were markedly lower than those in U937 foam cells. The protein expression of IL-10 and mRNA expressions of IL-10 and its receptor IL-10R were markedly higher than those in U937 foam cells. GbE inhibited production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, but up-regulated the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and its receptor IL-10R in U937 foam cells, which might be related with its anti-atherosclerotic actions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiao", "ForeName": "Ya-Bin", "Initials": "YB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rui", "ForeName": "Yao-Cheng", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Peng-Yuan", "Initials": "PY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Tie-Jun", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1beta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Interleukin-10"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "oxidized low density lipoprotein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "130068-27-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-10"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Foam Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-10"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1beta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Interleukin-10"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "U937 Cells"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18050733"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
