One of the numerous possible examples in the infusion of Conium maculatum, better known as Hemlock, a plant belonging to the family umbelliferae, used by the ancient Egyptians to cure skin diseases. The current official pharmacopoeia includes various chemical substances produced by secondary plant metabolisms. For example, the immunosuppressive drugs used to prevent organ transplant rejection and the majority of antibiotics are metabolites produced by fungal organisms, pilocarpin, digitalis, strophantus, salicylic acid and curare are examples of plant organism metabolites. For this reason, there has been an increase in research into plants, based on information on their medicinal use in the areas where they grow. The study of plants in relation to local culture and traditions is known as \"ethnobotany\". Careful study of the behaviour of sick animals has also led to the discovery of medicinal plants. The study of this subject is known as \"zoopharmacognosy\". The aim of this article is to discuss the fact that \"ad hoc\" production of such chemical substances, defined as \"secondary metabolites\", is one of the modes in which plant organisms respond to unfavourable environmental stimuli, such as an attack by predatory phytophagous animals or an excessive number of plant individuals, even of the same species, in a terrain. In the latter case, the plant organisms produce toxic substances, called \"allelopathic\" which limit the growth of other individuals. \"Secondary metabolites\" are produced by metabolic systems that are shunts of the primary systems which, when required, may be activated from the beginning, or increased to the detriment of others. The study of the manner in which such substances are produced is the subject of a new branch of learning called \"ecological biochemistry\"."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Territorial Ecology and Terrestrial Environments, University of Pavia, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Attardo", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sartori", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Boll Chim Farm", "NlmUniqueID": "0372534", "ISSNLinking": "0006-6648"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Factors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "36"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12705091"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
