We aimed to assess the potential relationships between serum fat soluble vitamins (Vitamins A and E), antibody titers to Hsp27 (anti-Hsp27) and hematological markers of inflammation, with mood disorders in a population of adolescent girls.", "A total of 563 adolescent girls (Age 12-18 years) were included in the study. The presence and severity of depression, insomnia and sleepiness were assessed using validated questionnaires. Serum vitamins A and E, anti-Hsp27 antibody titers, white blood cell, lymphocyte, neutrophil, platelet counts, and red blood cell distribution width (RDW), were also measured. Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and RDW to platelet ratio (RPR) were calculated.", "Serum anti-HSP27 antibody titers, PLR, and RPR values was significantly higher in subjects with a high depression score compared to normal individuals (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). However, there was no association between serum inflammatory markers concentrations and sleep disorders; although individuals with insomnia had a lower vitamin E/HDL ratio compared to healthy adolescents. In multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusted for potential confounders, anti-HSP was an independent predictor of severe depression (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.0, 95% CI: 1.6-15.7, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).", "The cross-sectional design of study and the inclusion of only female adolescents participants are limitations.", "Our findings suggest that serum anti-HSP27 antibody titers may be useful biological marker in depressive patients. This finding may support a role of oxidative stress in the etiology of depression, and targeting this pathway may be of value in the treatment of depression."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
