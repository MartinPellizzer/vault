We have detected 100 species which are or have been consumed in this region, 83 of which are treated here (the remaining are the cultivated food plants without additional medicinal uses). Some of them, such as Achillea ptarmica subsp. pyrenaica, Convolvulus arvensis, Leontodon hispidus, Molopospermum peloponnesiacum and Taraxacum dissectum, have not been previously reported, or have only very rarely been cited or indicated as plant foods in very restricted geographical areas. Several of these edible wild plants have a therapeutic use attributed to them by local people, making them a kind of functional food. They are usually eaten raw, dressed in salads or cooked; the elaboration of products from these species such as liquors or marmalades is a common practice in the region. The consumption of these resources is still fairly alive in popular practice, as is the existence of homegardens, where many of these plants are cultivated for private consumption."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratori de Bot\u00e0nica, Facultat de Farm\u00e0cia, Universitat de Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rigat", "ForeName": "Montse", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bonet", "ForeName": "Maria \u00c0ngels", "Initials": "M\u00c0"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garcia", "ForeName": "S\u00f2nia", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garnatje", "ForeName": "Teresa", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vall\u00e8s", "ForeName": "Joan", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ecol Food Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0315073", "ISSNLinking": "0367-0244"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Functional Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21883071", "10.1080/03670240903022320"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
