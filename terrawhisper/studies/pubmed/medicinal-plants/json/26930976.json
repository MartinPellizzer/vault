The altitude of its distribution areas ranged from 351~663 m. The types of its habitats included coniferous forest, broad-leaved forest and bamboo forest. The plants in these communities were composed of 56 species belonging to 48 genera,33 families. Among associated plants, the dominant species of tree layer were Bambusa distegia, Quercus variabilis , Cupressusfunebris etc. The dominant species of shrub layer were Pittosporum illicioides, Loropetalum chinense, Myrsine africana, Ardisia japonica, Smilax china etc. The dominant species of field layer were Iris japonica, Miscanthus floridulus, Veronicastrum longispicatum, Carex lancifolia, Epimedium myrianthum etc. Species abundance index of D was between 1.1143 to 3.7781 in seven populations,the species in these communities were relatively less,and the numbers of individuals were relatively more. Compared with others, the population of the 3rd and 6th had relatively low index of H' (Shannon-wiener index) and E (Pielou index). The distribution of these species in the community was obviously uneven. The D value,H' value and E value of tree layer species richness were lower than those of shrub layer and field layer, the species diversity was worse.", "It is suggested to incorporate Epimedium myrianthum in the new edition of Chinese Pharmacopeia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Mao-xiang", "Initials": "MX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zheng-yu", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Ru-gang", "Initials": "RG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Jiang-qun", "Initials": "JQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Altitude"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Epimedium"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26930976"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
