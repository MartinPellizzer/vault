This study tries to explore which agents were most widely used in Europe in the pre-insulin era. According to the scientific literature and the proprietary drug industry around 1900, more than 100 agents were considered to have hypoglycemic activity. Most of them seem to have been used only occasionally while some others were recommended and marketed to a large extent. Among the medicinal plants, Syzygium cumini (syn. S. jambolanum, Eugenia jambolana), Vaccinum myrtillus and Phaseolus sp. were most common, and other frequently used agents were opium, opium alkaloids, other alkaloids like quinine or Belladonna alkaloids, salicylates, alkaline substances like sodium (bi)carbonate and even strong poisons like arsenic or uranium salts. Syzygium jambolanum seed powder seems to be one of the most intensively studied antidiabetic agents of plant origin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for the History of Pharmacy, University of Marburg, Germany. helmstaedter@govi.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Helmst\u00e4dter", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Pharmazie", "NlmUniqueID": "9800766", "ISSNLinking": "0031-7144"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Salicylamides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "history"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Utilization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["history", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Salicylamides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Syzygium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17944329"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
