With a long history, it can be found in the Four Medical Tantras written by gYu-thog rNying-ma Yon-tan mGon-po since the 8th century AD. Qumazi grows in mudflats and fields, including species growing in highlands, lowlands, mountains and farmlands. According to records in Crystal Beads Materia Medica, it features green sword-shaped leaves, thin stems with red veins, inserted panicles, white chicken-like flowers and copper needle row-like roots. However, there are many inconsistent morphological descriptions for Qumazi plants in many Chinese versions of Tibetan medicine books. In this article, after studying ancient and modern Tibetan medicine books, consulting experts and conducting surveys, the authors confirmed that Qumazi belongs to Rheum of Polygonaceae, including Rheum nobile Hook. f. et. Thoms, R. globulosum Gage, R. alexandrae Hook. f. et. Thoms, R. pumilum Maxim and R. delavayi Franch. In some regions, Qumazi is substituted by R. spiciforme Royle and R. przewalskyi Losinsk. After the Chinese version of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Drug Illustrations was published in 1972, Qumazi has been miswritten as P. sibiricum Laxm in many Chinese versions of Tibetan medicine books, perhaps because P. sibiricum Laxm has many similar features with Qumazi as described in Crystal Beads Materia Medica and then is mistranslated from Tibetan to Chinese versions. According to records, Qumazi can reduce edema and is mainly applied to treat the minamata disease in clinic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Wu-zheng", "Initials": "WZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qi-en", "Initials": "QE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dor", "ForeName": "Jerenchen", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Si-yu", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shi Jin-bo"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Ying-zhou", "Initials": "YZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Xing-li", "Initials": "XL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Tibetan Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Polygonaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Books, Medical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26390671"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
