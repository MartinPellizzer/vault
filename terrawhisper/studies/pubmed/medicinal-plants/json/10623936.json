(St. John's Wort) is a widely distributed herbaceous perennial plant which has been well known as a medicinal plant since antiquity. In recent years, H. perforatum has received increasing attention for the treatment of depression and other neuralgic disorders. The main constituents of H. perforatum extract include flavonoids, naphthodianthrones, phloroglucinols, essential oils and xanthones. The present work reports the analysis of naphthodianthrones and phloroglucinols in H. perforatum extracts by means of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled simultaneously to a diode array detector (DAD) and electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Hypericin, pseudohypericin, hyperforin and adhyperforin were separated and identified on the base of their on-line UV and mass spectra. Quantitative analysis of hypericin derivatives in different extracts of H. perforatum using DAD and MS detectors was performed. In addition, direct infusion ESI-MS of H. perforatum extracts was applied to obtain rapid mass fingerprints of constituents present in the sample."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ITBA/CNR, Via Fratelli Cervi, 93-20090 Segrate (Milano), Italy. mauri@itba.mi.cnr.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mauri", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pietta", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "8802365", "ISSNLinking": "0951-4198"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10623936", "10.1002/(SICI)1097-0231(20000130)14:2<95::AID-RCM843>3.0.CO;2-6", "10.1002/(SICI)1097-0231(20000130)14:2<95::AID-RCM843>3.0.CO;2-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
