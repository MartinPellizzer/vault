Early researches of <i>S. tonkinensis</i> were focused on rapid propagation and quality analysis of <i>in vitro</i> tissue culture plantlet, and still no research focuses on the plant breeding of and there were no excellent varieties for artificial cultivation of <i>S. tonkinensis</i>.", "To set up a method to generate and select the best varieties of <i>S. tonkinensis</i> by polyploid breeding after induction by colchicine treatment.", "The adventitious buds were submerged in different concentrations of aqueous colchicine solution for different lengths of time to induce polyploidy in the plants, and the induced buds were identified by root-tip chromosome determination and leaf characteristics comparison. The contents of matrine and oxymatrine of radix ex rhizoma in 13 selected tetraploid lines were collected after 90 days <i>in vitro</i> rooting culture and were evaluated to provide evidence of good qualities of tetraploid <i>S. tonkinensis</i>.", "The results showed that the highest percentage of tetraploid induction was 23.33% and occurred in the 0.2% (w/v) colchicine treatment for 30 h. Fifty lines of tetraploid plants were obtained and 12 of the 13 selected tetraploid lines exhibited higher productivity of total contents of matrine and oxymatrine when compared to controls.", "The data demonstrate that polyploidy induction can be beneficial for improving the medicinal value of <i>S. tonkinensis</i>.", "Colchicine has a good <i>in vitro</i> induction effect on the tetraploid plants of <i>Sophora tonkinensis</i>The leaf indices and stomatal apparatus of tetraploid plants were slightly larger than diploid plantsThe total content of matrine and oxymatrine of some tetraploid lines for 90-day-old <i>in vitro</i> rooting culture was higher than the diploid. <b>Abbreviations used:</b> MS medium: Murashige and Skoog medium; BAP: 6-benzylaminopurine; NAA: A-naphthaleneacetic acid; IAA: Indole-3-acetic acid; KT: Kinetin; IBA: Indole-3-butyric acid; ABT: Rooting power."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources Protection and Genetic Improvement, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, Nanning 530023, Guangxi, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Kun Hua", "Initials": "KH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inner Mongolia Research Center of Characteristic Medicinal Plants Cultivation and Protection Engineering Technology, Baotou Medical College, Baotou 014060, Inner Mongolia, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jian Ping", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources Protection and Genetic Improvement, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, Nanning 530023, Guangxi, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Lin Xuan", "Initials": "LX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Chemical Engineering, Lushan College of Guangxi University of Science and Technology, Liuzhou 545616, Guangxi, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Jin Yuan", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources Protection and Genetic Improvement, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, Nanning 530023, Guangxi, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Miao", "ForeName": "Jian Hua", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources Protection and Genetic Improvement, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, Nanning 530023, Guangxi, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inner Mongolia Research Center of Characteristic Medicinal Plants Cultivation and Protection Engineering Technology, Baotou Medical College, Baotou 014060, Inner Mongolia, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Min Hui", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacogn Mag", "NlmUniqueID": "101300403", "ISSNLinking": "0973-1296"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Wang JM, Cui Y.
