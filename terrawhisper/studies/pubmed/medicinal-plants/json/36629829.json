The decline in natural population levels is being exacerbated by climate change. In order to ensure the preservation of valuable genotypes, there is an urgent need to develop strategies to conserve the genetic diversity present within this species. At present, cryopreservation is the most viable option for the long-term storage of plant germplasm, particularly for long-lived species which are challenging to maintain in the field.", "To cryopreserve intact seeds of S. mahagoni, with the dual goal of retaining the biosynthetic capacity of plants, which is critical since this species is highly valued for medicinal purposes.", "Seeds at a moisture content of 6% were immersed in liquid nitrogen (LN) before warming and recovery. Plantlet establishment and growth were assessed over a period of 70 days and anthraquinone synthesis was determined in roots, stems and leaves.", "The results showed an initial lag in the germination rate of cryopreserved seeds compared with control seeds; however, this difference disappeared over time. The lag in seedling emergence observed in cryostored seeds was also evident in the plant characteristics measured following 30 days of culture when all plant parameters measured were significantly higher in plants produced from control than cryostored seeds. However, after 70 days of growth, these differences were no longer apparent. Anthraquinone levels were also initially lower (at 30 days) in plants regenerated from cryopreserved seeds than those from control seeds, however, this difference was substantially reduced by 70 days thereby indicating the ability of these plants to accumulate secondary metabolites, albeit at a reduced rate, during the early stages of development.", "In S. mahagoni, the delay in anthraquinone production in plants regenerated from cryostored seeds during the early stages of development may have occurred as a consequence of the preferential allocation of resources towards the initiation of recovery processes in response to the stresses imposed by cryopreservation. Once the stresses were overcome and plant growth resumed, resources could be directed to secondary processes such as anthraquinone synthesis. doi.org/10.54680/fr22610110412."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Plant Breeding and Conservation of Genetic Resources, Bioplant Centre, University of Ciego de Avila, Ciego de Avila, 69450, Cuba."}], "LastName": "Entensa", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Plant Breeding and Conservation of Genetic Resources, Bioplant Centre, University of Ciego de Avila, Ciego de Avila, 69450, Cuba."}], "LastName": "Gonzalez-Morales", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Plant Breeding and Conservation of Genetic Resources, Bioplant Centre, University of Ciego de Avila, Ciego de Avila, 69450, Cuba."}], "LastName": "Linares", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Plant Breeding and Conservation of Genetic Resources, Bioplant Centre, University of Ciego de Avila, Ciego de Avila, 69450, Cuba."}], "LastName": "Vazquez", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Plant Breeding and Conservation of Genetic Resources, Bioplant Centre, University of Ciego de Avila, Ciego de Avila, 69450, Cuba."}], "LastName": "Martinez-Montero", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad Estatal del Sur de Manab\u00ed (UNESUM), Ecuador."}], "LastName": "Zevallos-Bravo", "ForeName": "B E", "Initials": "BE", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Improvement; Agricultural Research Council-Tropical and Subtropical Crops; Private Bag X11208, Nelspruit, 1200, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Hajari", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Julius K\u00fchn Institute, Institute for Breeding Research on Fruit Crops, Pillnitzer Platz 3a, 01326 Dresden, Germany."}], "LastName": "Hofer", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Plant Breeding and Conservation of Genetic Resources, Bioplant Centre, University of Ciego de Avila, Ciego de Avila, 69450, Cuba."}], "LastName": "Villalobos-Olivera", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Plant Breeding and Conservation of Genetic Resources, Bioplant Centre, University of Ciego de Avila, Ciego de Avila, 69450, Cuba. jclorenzo@bioplantas.cu."}], "LastName": "Lorenzo", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cryo Letters", "NlmUniqueID": "9891832", "ISSNLinking": "0143-2044"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cryopreservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meliaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "53"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36629829"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
