The starches were provided as supplements (100 g/kg diet) to a semi-synthetic basal diet (B), and their effects on the apparent digestibilities of nitrogen and fat, and on gains of live weight, fat and lean tissue were examined. Diet B alone was the control; sucrose (Su) and Solka-floc cellulose (SFC) were also examined for reference. Apparent digestibilities for Su, SFC, RMS and RPS were 1.0, 0.16, 0.98 and 0.89 respectively. Whereas the apparent digestibilities of gross energy, N and fat in the diet were unaffected by supplementation with Su, each was decreased by supplementation with SFC, RMS and RPS. Partial digestible energy values calculated from the intakes and faecal losses of energy in the basal and supplemented diets were 15, 12.4 and 0.8 kJ/g for RMS, RPS and SFC respectively. These values were smaller than corresponding apparent digestible energy values calculated from the apparent digestibility of the supplement and its gross energy value. Only the Su and starch supplements increased the intake of apparent digestible energy and the gain of live weight. Both starches and Su increased total energy (and fat) deposition to almost similar extents. It is concluded that the resistant starches contribute significant dietary energy, enhance growth and elevate fat deposition to extents almost similar to Su."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Food Research, Norwich Laboratory."}], "LastName": "Livesey", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Davies", "ForeName": "I R", "Initials": "IR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Faulks", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Southon", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0372547", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "57-50-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Sucrose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Amylases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Sucrose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Amylases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2383526", "10.1079/bjn19900134"]}}]}
