The physiological control of angiogenesis depends on the balance between stimulatory and inhibitory factors. Therefore, a number of anti-angiogenic approaches has been developed, many of them based on the inhibition of the functional activity of pro-angiogenic factors. The aim of the present study was to compare the anti-angiogenic effectiveness of sulindac sulfone and some herbal compounds in the serum-induced angiogenesis test performed in Balb/c mice. Pooled sera from 35 patients with diabetes type 2 and retinopathy were used as pro-angiogenic stimuli. The strongest inhibitory effect was observed for the sulindac sulfone and ursolic acid in the highest concentration of 200 micro g/ml, as well as for the low-dosage concomitant treatment with 2 micro g/ml of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, green tea flavanol), ursolic acid (plant-derived triterpenoid), sulindac sulfone and convalamaroside (steroidal saponin). Combination treatment was significantly more effective than monotherapy with medium (20 micro g/ml) or lowest doses of tested compounds. The present study is the first to demonstrate the potent anti-angiogenic effect of the combination therapy comprising of plant-derived extracts and sulindac sulfone, as tested in the in vivo angiogenesis experimental model with sera of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy patients used as the pro-angiogenic stimuli. We think that it might be the first step toward application of some of these compounds, in the future, in preventive anti-angiogenic therapy of these patients, as well, as in the treatment of later, proliferative stage of this disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Second Department of Ophtalmology, Medical University of Warsaw, 13 Sierakowskiego street, 03-709 Warsaw, Poland. pskopin@ib.amwaw.edu.pl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skopinski", "ForeName": "Piotr", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Szaflik", "ForeName": "Jerzy", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duda-Kr\u00f3l", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nartowska", "ForeName": "Jadwiga", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sommer", "ForeName": "Ewa", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chorostowska-Wynimko", "ForeName": "Joanna", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Demkow", "ForeName": "Urszula", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skopinska-R\u00f3zewska", "ForeName": "Ewa", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Int J Mol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9810955", "ISSNLinking": "1107-3756"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Angiogenesis Inducing Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "184SNS8VUH", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulindac"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K619IIG2R9", "NameOfSubstance": "sulindac sulfone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Angiogenesis Inducing Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "complications"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "complications"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Retinopathy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Neovascularization, Physiologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Serum"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulindac"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15375605"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
