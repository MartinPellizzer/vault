T-2 toxin was detected using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection at 208 nm and thin layer chromatography (TLC) was used for confirmation of the T-2 toxin-contaminated samples (> or = 1 ppm). The recovery was 93 +/- 3.3% (SD 3.29, n = 5) for chickpea spiked with a known amount of T-2 toxin (1 ppm). The detection limits for T-2 toxin for HPLC and TLC were 25 ng per injection and 50 ng per spot, respectively. A total of 50 commercially available cereal and pulse product samples, collected from markets and street bazaars, were analysed. Incidences of T-2 toxin detected in cereal and pulse products were 23.5% and 31.2%, respectively and the maximum detected amount was 1.9 ppm in a sample of dried beans. The incidence of toxin-contaminated specimens is not so low relative to the volume of specimens produced."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Marmara University, Haydarpa\u015f-Istanbul, Turkey. gomurtag@marmara.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Omurtag", "ForeName": "G Z", "Initials": "GZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yazicio\u011flu", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Addit Contam", "NlmUniqueID": "8500474", "ISSNLinking": "0265-203X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "I3FL5NM3MO", "NameOfSubstance": "T-2 Toxin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "T-2 Toxin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11552752", "10.1080/02652030118172"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
