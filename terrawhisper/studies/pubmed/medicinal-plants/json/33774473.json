Currently ongoing related in silico studies, followed by further in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo/preclinical studies, will hopefully provide important findings in terms of which molecules within each given NPS class may present with higher levels of receptor affinities, and hence clinical potency. Understanding the pharmacological characteristics/potency of those novel recreational molecules will hopefully help in predicting related NPS diffusion, morbidity and possible lethality data."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
