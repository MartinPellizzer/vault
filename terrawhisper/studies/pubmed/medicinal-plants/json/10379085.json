These were significantly (P < 0.05) more likely to be women, who also thought regular check-ups were of little value. In their use of health services 73% experienced language difficulties. 33% of the sample were tobacco smokers.

There are sex differences in reported behaviour and attitudes about use of dental services and in tobacco and paan use in this Bangladeshi sample.
