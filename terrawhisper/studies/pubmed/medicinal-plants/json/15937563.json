Being a time-tested system, it has an edge over other existing systems of health management, especially for dealing with chronic disorders such as coronary artery disease, which is of a complex multi-etiological nature. Recently, we have shown that BHUx, a patented polyherbal formulation consisting of the aqueous fraction of five medicinal plants of the ayurvedic system, has significant anti-inflammatory properties through inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 and lipoxygenase-15. Here we have investigated its effect on diet-induced atherosclerosis in albino rabbits. BHUx was given orally for 3 months to rabbits pre-treated with an atherogenic diet for 3 months. After 6 months, the dorsal aorta was processed for histological studies for calcium and collagen content. The results demonstrated a remarkable reduction in intimal thickening in the treated animals. In addition, there was less calcification at the intima-medial interface and increased intensity of collagen cap on the surface along with an increase in survival, compared with the sham control. We suggest that BHUx is a potent, multi-factorial formulation against atherosclerosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tripathi", "ForeName": "Yamini B", "Initials": "YB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Birendra K", "Initials": "BK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pandey", "ForeName": "Ravi S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Mohan", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Evid Based Complement Alternat Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101215021", "ISSNLinking": "1741-427X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ross R.
