This method is based on the diffusion of an antibiotic from a filter paper disc through the solidified culture media of a Petri dish used for study. The growth of inoculated is inhibited entirely in a circular area \"Zone around the filter\" paper disc containing a solution of antibiotic and the plant extract. The microorganisms used were: 1. Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positive 2. Escherichia coli (Gram negative). The organisms were maintained on nutrient agar slants. These were tested using nutrient broth. One loop full of the respective cultures was taken in slants which were maintained below 40 degrees C were taken and inoculated in the broth and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hrs and were observed for the growth of the organism with naked eye for their turbid nature. It was compared with that of sterile broth. The presence of turbidity indicated growth and suitability of the culture for further work."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, 7th April University, Az-Zawia, Tripoli, Libya. zulfkarzulfi@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qadrie", "ForeName": "Zulfkar Latief", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jacob", "ForeName": "Beena", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anandan", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rajkapoor", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rahamathulla", "ForeName": "Mohammed", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disk Diffusion Antimicrobial Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19339219"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
