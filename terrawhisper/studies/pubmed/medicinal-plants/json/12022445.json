However, the mechanisms by which this formula affects CI remain unknown. Previously, regulation of serum cytokine levels by YH-Tang has been observed in individuals at the acute stage of CI disease. It is uncertain whether this is a cause or a result of the disease process. In this study, we investigated whether YH-Tang inhibited secretion of inflammatory cytokines from human astrocytes. YH-Tang regulated the cytokine secretions in astrocytes stimulated with substance P (SP) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). YH-Tang significantly inhibited interleukin (IL)-1, IL-4, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion in astrocytes stimulated with SP and LPS, but did not inhibit interferon-y (IFN-gamma) and IL-2 secretion significantly. IL-1 has been shown to elevate TNF-alpha secretion from LPS-stimulated astrocytes while having no effect on astrocytes in the absence of LPS. Therefore, we investigated whether IL-1 mediated inhibition of TNF-alpha secretion from astrocytes by YH-Tang. Incubation of human astrocytes with IL-1 antibody abolished the synergistic cooperative effect of LPS and SP. These results suggest that YH-Tang may indirectly inhibit TNF-alpha secretion by inhibiting IL-1 secretion. Moreover, these findings indicate that YH-Tang has regulatory effects on cytokine secretion in an acute CI patient."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Oriental Medicine, Center of Oriental Medicinal Science, Wonkwang University, Iksan-city, Chonbuk, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Ji-Suk", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Seung-Woo", "Initials": "SW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ju", "ForeName": "Jong-Chun", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Si-Woo", "Initials": "SW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Kvung-Yo", "Initials": "KY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyung-Min", "Initials": "HM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8800150", "ISSNLinking": "0892-3973"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33507-63-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Substance P"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Astrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Down-Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Substance P"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12022445", "10.1081/iph-120003403"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
