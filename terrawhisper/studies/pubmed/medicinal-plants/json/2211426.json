For all nine hays, DM and NDF digestibility by cattle and goats was higher (P less than .05) than by sheep, with no differences due to forage class. Cattle had a higher (P less than .01) DM intake than sheep or goats averaged across forage (92.6 vs 65.8 and 68.6 g/kg BW.75); hay intake was highest on legume, with no difference between C3 and C4 grasses. Mean NDF intake by cattle was greater than by sheep or goats (58.7 vs 39.6 and 42.6 g/kg BW.75); NDF intake for all animal species decreased in the order C4 grass greater than C3 grass greater than legume. Particle passage rates did not differ (P greater than .05) with forage class but were higher (P less than .02) for sheep and goats than for cattle. Prefeeding ruminal DM fill values, determined by emptying, were 10.6, 15.0 and 19.9 g/kg BW1.0 for alfalfa, orchardgrass and switchgrass hays fed to cattle, and 11.2, 11.3 and 16.5 g/kg BW1.0 for the same hays fed to sheep. Estimated turnover times for DM and NDF were shorter (P less than .05) for sheep than for cattle; DM turnover was longer for switchgrass than for alfalfa and orchardgrass, with no forage differences in NDF turnover between these two animal species. Results show that goats were superior to sheep in NDF digestion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Div. of Anim. and Vet.
