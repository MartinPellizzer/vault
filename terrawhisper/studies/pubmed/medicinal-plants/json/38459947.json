Endometrial carcinoma accounts for 97% of all uterine malignancies and 3 % of sarcomas that develop from the endometrium's glands. Endometrial cancer is frequently found in its early stages since most women quickly report postmenopausal vaginal hemorrhage. The need for more advanced medications to improve survival in such situations is still unfulfilled. As a result, there is growing interest in employing an herbal treatment to treat endometriosis, which seems to be an effective strategy. We have discovered a few unintended targets (ligands) in our investigation that are active components of common therapeutic herbs. The differentially expressed genes (DEG - target protein) for endometrial cancer were found using the NCBI and CIViC databases. In our investigation, the protein used for docking and simulation was PDB ID: 3THW. Using the Cytoscape server, the gene-encoding protein network has been identified. It was discovered that the Protein 3THW's binding energy to the bioactive substance (Asarone) was -7.15\u2009Kcal/mol. It was discovered that the crucial interacting amino acid residues were ILE648, PHE650, ILE651, VAL802, TYR815, VAL817. The properties of the pharmaceutical target are further investigated by employing a molecular simulation study for 100\u2009ns with NAMD software. Low RMSD and SASA (Solvent accessible surface area), high RMSF, High hydrogen bonds, between Asarone and MSH2 demonstrated their potency as endometrial cancer inhibitor compounds. Based on these analyses we infer that the bioactive substances originating from medicinal plants may be an effective treatment for endometrial cancer.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
