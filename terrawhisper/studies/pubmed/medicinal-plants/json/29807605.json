In the present study, Withania somnifera plants were subjected to water stress and data related to drought tolerance phenomenon was collected and a putative mechanistic concept considering growth responses, physiological behaviour, and metabolite content and gene expression aspects is presented. Drought induced metabolic and physiological responses as well as drastic decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> uptake due to stomatal limitations. As a result, the consumption of reduction equivalents (NADPH<sup>2+</sup>) for CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation via the calvin cycle declines significantly resulting in the generation of a large oxidative stress and an oversupply of antioxidant enzymes. Drought also results in the shifting of metabolic processes towards biosynthetic activities that consume reduction equivalents. Thus, biosynthesis of reduced compounds (isoprenoids, phenols and alkaloids) is enhanced. The dynamics of various metabolites have been discussed in the light of gene expression analysis of control and drought treated leaves. Gene encoding enzymes of pathways leading to glucose, fructose and fructan production, conversion of triose phosphates to hexoses and hexose phosphorylation were up-regulated in the drought stressed leaves. The down-regulated Calvin cycle genes were co-ordinately regulated with the down-regulation of chloroplast triosephosphate/phosphate translocator, cytoplasmic fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase and fructose bisphosphatase. Expression of gene encoding Squalene Synthase (SQS) was highly upregulated under drought stress which is responsible for the diversion of carbon flux towards withanolides biosynthesis from isoprenoid pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
