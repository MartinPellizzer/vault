DAP-1 showed not only anti-complementary activity but also a stimulating effect on the mitogenic activity of lymphocytes. DAP-1 also significantly suppressed the phagocytic activity of macrophages. Although DAP-1 directly stimulated the mitogenecity of lymphocytes, it had no effect on lipopolysaccharide- or concanavalin A-induced mitogenic activity of lymphocytes. Periodate oxidation and pronase digestion suggested that the polysaccharide moiety in DAP-1 contributed to the expression of its anti-complementary and mitogenic activities and that the protein moiety in DAP-1 was responsible for its effect on phagocytosis. DAP-1 gave three polysaccharide fractions (DAP-2, 3, and 4) by fractionation using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. All the fractions had potent anti-complementary activity, but showed different stimulating or suppressive effects on the proliferation of lymphocytes, phagocytosis, or acid phosphatase activity. Three potent anti-complementary polysaccharides (DAP-4I-1a, DAP-4I-1b, and DAP-4IIa-1) were purified from DAP-4 by anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and HPLC. DAP-4I-1a, I-1b, and IIa-1 consisted of Ara, Rha, Xyl, Gal, Glc and GlcA in a molar ratio of 1.0:0.7:1.0:18.6:22.2:nil; 1.0:0.1:0.3:19.3:26.8:nil; and 3.7:trace:0.6:26.3:5.5:1.0; respectively. Among the polysaccharides, only DAP-4IIa-1 reacted with beta-glucosyl-Yariv antigen. Methylation analysis indicated that DAP-4I-1a mainly comprised 4-linked Gal and 3-, 4-, and 6-linked Glc, whereas DAP-4IIa-1 consisted mainly of terminal Araf, 3-linked Glc, and 3,6-branched Gal."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oriental Medicine Research Center, Kitasato Institute, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kiyohara", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsumoto", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Complement Inactivator Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Complement Inactivator Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C3H"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phagocytosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "10", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9342940", "10.1055/s-2006-957720"]}}]}
