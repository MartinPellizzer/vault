Extraction of RFO was carried out in 80% ethanol and the extract was passed through a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge. This proved to be an improvement on the currently accepted purification technique. High-quality electrophoregrams were obtained which allowed the separation and quantitation of sucrose, raffinose, stachyose and verbascose The CZE results were compared with those obtained by anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a triple-pulsed amperometric detection (HPAC-PAD). The samples were obtained from four pea strains which were near-isogenic except for genes at the r and rb loci. A high degree of precision and reproducibility was obtained for the RFO compositions of all the pea strains. No statistically significant differences (p < or equal to 0.05) were found between the two analytical techniques using paired Student-t tests."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Genetics, John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK."}], "LastName": "Frias", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Price", "ForeName": "K R", "Initials": "KR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fenwick", "ForeName": "G R", "Initials": "GR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hedley", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "S\u00f8rensen", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vidal-VALverde", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Galactosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "25VX64653N", "NameOfSubstance": "stachyose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-50-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Sucrose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N5O3QU595M", "NameOfSubstance": "Raffinose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Capillary"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Galactosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Raffinose"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sucrose"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8589830", "10.1016/0021-9673(95)00236-7", "0021-9673(95)00236-7"]}}]}
