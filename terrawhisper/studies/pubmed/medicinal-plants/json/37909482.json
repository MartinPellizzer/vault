In this study, \u03b2-sitosterol, which boosts antioxidant enzymes and reduces oxidative stress, was qualitatively and quantitatively identified in the methanolic extract of the plant's leaves using the HPTLC. Our findings show that <i>N. arbor-tristis</i> has a significant concentration of \u03b2-sitosterol with the 0.64\u2009Rf value. Further, docking and simulation (<i>in</i>-<i>silico</i>) studies have shown that \u03b2-sitosterol has good binding affinity with human DNA Topoisomerase I (h-DNA Topo I) and has the potential to inhibit its activity. It can be reconstructed as h-DNA Topo I determent.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
