The effects of pre-treatments from ORI against MPP<sup>+</sup>- or kainic acid (KA)-induced damage in nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated PC12\u202fcells were investigated. Results showed that pre-treatments of ORI at 0.25-2\u202f\u03bcM enhanced the viability and plasma membrane integrity of NGF-differentiated PC12\u202fcells. MPP<sup>+</sup> or KA exposure down-regulated Bcl-2 mRNA expression, up-regulated Bax mRNA expression, increased caspase-3 activity and decreased Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase activity. ORI pre-treatments at test concentrations reversed these changes. ORI pre-treatments decreased reactive oxygen species production, raised glutathione level, and increased glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and catalase activities in MPP<sup>+</sup> or KA treated cells. ORI pre-treatments lowered tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> levels in MPP<sup>+</sup> or KA treated cells. ORI also diminished MPP<sup>+</sup> or KA induced increase in nuclear factor-\u03baB binding activity. MPP<sup>+</sup> exposure suppressed tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA expression and decreased dopamine content. KA exposure reduced glutamine synthetase (GS) mRNA expression, raised glutamate level and lowered glutamine level. ORI pre-treatments at 0.5-2\u202f\u03bcM up-regulated mRNA expression of TH and GS, restored DA and glutamine content. These findings suggested that oridonin was a potent neuro-protective agent against Parkinson's disease and seizure."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
