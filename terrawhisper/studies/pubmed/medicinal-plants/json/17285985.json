Pre-column derivatization was performed using 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC) to form derivatives. The mobile phase consisted of methanol and 0. 05 mol x L( -1) NaH2 PO4 (48: 52) (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH solution) in a flow rate of 1.0 mL m min(-1). The ultraviolet (UV) detection wavelength was set at 262 nm.", "The linearity was demonstrated over a wide range of concentration from 1.76 mg L(-1) to 352 mg x L(-1) for dencichine. The detection limit was determined to be 60 microg x L(-1). The derivative was stable and the derivatization agent did not influence the measurement of dencichine. The average recovery rate was 95. 3% and the relative standard derivation (RSD) was 1. 7%. The method was used to determine dencichine in different P. notoginseng extracts and drug preparations.", "This method is simple, fast and sensitive, suitable for determining the dencichine in P. notoginseng extracts and drug preparations as well as for the study of the dencichine metabolism in vivo."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "West China School of Pharmacy, Sichuan university, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "San-kang", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Chun-mei", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhang-wan", "Initials": "ZW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids, Diamino"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1TG777QI25", "NameOfSubstance": "oxalyldiaminopropionic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9PLB0BTT90", "NameOfSubstance": "1-(9-fluorenyl)methyl chloroformate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids, Diamino"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax notoginseng"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17285985"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
