The hepatoprotective effect of C. tinctoria and its bioactive basis have seldom been investigated until now. In the present study, capitula of C. tinctoria were extracted with a method optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) and BoxBehnken design (BBD) and further purified by macroporous resin HPD-300 to obtain a fraction (CE) enriched with flavonoids and phenolic acids. The contents of the four most abundant compounds, isookanin-7-O-\u03b2-d-glucoside (1), quercetigetin-7-O-\u03b2-d-glucoside (2), okanin (3), and marein (4), were determined by HPLC as 9.98, 5.21, 41.78 and 1.85\u00a0mg/g, respectively. Seventy-four compounds including fifity-five flavonoids, fifteen organic acids (twelve of them were phenolic compounds), and three coumarins were tentatively identified in CE by LC-HRMS/MS. In vivo hepatoprotective effect and potential mechanism of CE were studied with a high-fat diet-induced NASH mouse model. CE administration decreased the amount of weight gain, hepatic lipid, and sequentially improved dyslipidemia, inflammation, oxidative stress, and IR in HFD-fed mice. Molecular data revealed that CE inhibited hepatic inflammation by reducing NF\u03baB/iNOS/COX-2/NLRP3/MAPK in the liver tissues and ameliorated oxidative stress by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Modulation of inflammation and oxidative stress with CE may represent a promising target for the treatment of NAFLD and provide insight into the mechanism by which CE protects against obesity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
