The overexpression of CAMKIV is directly associated with the development of different types of cancers. Hesperidin is abundantly found in citrus fruits and exhibits wide range of pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and anticancerous effects. We have investigated binding mechanism of hesperidin with the CAMKIV using molecular docking methods followed by fluorescence quenching and isothermal titration calorimetric assays. An appreciable binding affinity of hesperidin was observed with CAMKIV during fluorescence quenching and isothermal titration calorimetric studies. Efficacy of hesperidin to inhibit the growth of human hepatic carcinoma (HepG2) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cancer cell lines were investigated. Hesperidin has significantly reduced the proliferation of HepG2 and SH-SY5Y cells and induces apoptosis by activating the caspase-3-dependent intrinsic pathway through the upregulation of proapoptotic Bax protein. Hesperidin treatment reduces the mitochondrial membrane potential of HepG2 and SH-SY5Y cells. All these observations clearly anticipated hesperidin a potent inhibitor of CAMKIV which may be further exploited a newer therapeutic approach for the management of different cancer types."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Naz", "ForeName": "Huma", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Tarique", "ForeName": "Mohd", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, College of Engineering & Technology, IFTM University, Delhi Road, Moradabad, India."}], "LastName": "Ahamad", "ForeName": "Shahzaib", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alajmi", "ForeName": "Mohamed F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Afzal", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Rehman", "ForeName": "Md Tabish", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Bioprospection Department of Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Luqman", "ForeName": "Suaib", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3663-4940"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "Md Imtaiyaz", "Initials": "MI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "8205768", "ISSNLinking": "0730-2312"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "E750O06Y6O", "NameOfSubstance": "Hesperidin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.17", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 4"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 4"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HEK293 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hesperidin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroblastoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31021496", "10.1002/jcb.28774"]}}]}
