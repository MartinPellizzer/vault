A. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 4911-4916]. In this work, one of the phenothiazine Ca2+ antagonists, chlorpromazine, was used as a photoaffinity probe to test for Ca(2+)-dependent binding of the probe to thylakoid proteins. [3H]Chlorpromazine photoaffinity-labels thylakoid polypeptides of Mr 8K and 6K, with generally much less label occurring in other proteins (some experiments showed labeled proteins at Mr 13K-15K). More label was incorporated in circumstances where it is expected that Ca2+ occupies the putative H+ flux gating site, compared to when the gating site is not occupied by calcium. The photoaffinity labeling of the 8-kDa protein was also influenced by the energization level of the thylakoids (less labeling under H+ uptake energization). The 8-kDa protein was identified by partial amino acid sequence data as subunit III of the thylakoid CF0 H+ channel complex. The partial amino acid sequence of the 6-kDa protein (19 residues were determined with some uncertainties) was compared to data in the GCG sequence analysis data base, and no clear identity to a known sequence was revealed. Neither the exact site of putative Ca2+ binding to the CF0 proteolipid nor the site of covalent attachment of the chlorpromazine to the CF0 component has been identified. Evidence for gating of energy-linked H+ fluxes by the hypothesized Ca(2+)-CF0 gating site came from the correlation between Ca(2+)-dependent binding of chlorpromazine to the CF0 8-kDa protein with inhibition of light-driven H+ uptake into the lumen but no inhibition of H+ uptake into sequestered membrane domains. When conditions favored a delocalized delta mu H+ coupling mode, less chlorpromazine was bound to the CF0 structure, and much larger amounts of H+ ions were accumulated in the lumen. The data support the hypothesis that Ca2+ ions act in concert with the 8-kDa CF0 protein (and perhaps another protein, the 6-kDa polypeptide?) in a gating mechanism for regulating the expression of the energy-coupling H+ gradient between localized or delocalized coupling modes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907."}], "LastName": "Chiang", "ForeName": "G G", "Initials": "GG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wooten", "ForeName": "D C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dilley", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0370623", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2960"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Affinity Labels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ion Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membrane Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenothiazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "538-75-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8L70Q75FXE", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U42B7VYA4P", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorpromazine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Affinity Labels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorpromazine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intracellular Membranes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ion Channel Gating"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ion Channels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenothiazines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1377026", "10.1021/bi00140a017"]}}]}
