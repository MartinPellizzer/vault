They are mainly classified as flavonoids, phenolic acids, lignans, stilbenes, and coumestans; some are resocyclic acids of lactones, which are mycotoxins and not natural phytoestrogen. Phytoestrogens have many beneficial medicinal properties, making them an important part of the daily diet. Electrochemical sensors are widely used analytical tools for analysing various pharmaceuticals, chemicals, pollutants and food items. Electrochemical sensors provide an extensive platform for highly sensitive and rapid analysis. Several reviews have been published on the importance of the biological and medicinal properties of phytoestrogens. However, this review provides an overview of recent work performed through electrochemical measurements with electrochemical sensors and biosensors for all the classes of phytoestrogens done so far since 2019."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
