FB1 and FB2 were detected using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection after derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde. A total of 115 commercially available herbal tea and medicinal plant samples were analyzed. The recoveries in black tea were 86.9+/-8.42% for FB1 and 102+/-6.80% for FB2 spiked with 1 microg/g of each analyte. Similarly, the mean recovery results in lime (linden) for FB1 and FB2 were 85.2+/-9.76% and 78.6+/-5.67%, respectively. The minimum detectable amounts for the o-phthaldialdehyde derivatives of FB1 and FB2 were 0.025 microg/g (1 ng injected) and 0.125 microg/g (5 ng), respectively. FB1 was detected in two samples (0.160 and 1.487 microg/g), and FB2 was detected in none of the samples."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Marmara University, 34668 Haydarpa\u015fa, Istanbul, Turkey. gomurtag@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Omurtag", "ForeName": "G\u00fclden Z", "Initials": "GZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yazicio\u011flu", "ForeName": "Duygu", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fumonisins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "116355-84-1", "NameOfSubstance": "fumonisin B2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3ZZM97XZ32", "NameOfSubstance": "fumonisin B1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Fumonisins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fusarium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Tea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15330551", "10.4315/0362-028x-67.8.1782", "S0362-028X(22)03639-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
