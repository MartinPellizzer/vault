Morphological features are one of the naming principles for Chinese medicines. In this paper, botanical origin plants under the names of \"Jinchai\" and \"Jinchai Shihu\" were investigated. Based on documents from the local Chronicles and historical accounts, the Chinese characters of Jinchai have the distinctive features of gold color and two hair clasps. Moreover, the hair clasps are usually cylindrical in shape with uniform thickness in middle and upper part, and tapers off to the foot. And its bottom part style is simple and head part is complex. Thus we speculated the herbal \"Jinchai\" and \"Jinchai Shihu\" should have similar morphologic features as Chinese characters of Jinchai, including golden color and hairpin shape of stems without braches, short and solid sterm. After comparing the dried vegetative morphology of 10 common medicinal Dendrobium species, we suggested that of Dendrobium flexicaule matches well with the morphological features from historical herbal records."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource, Endangered Medicinal Breeding National Engineering Laboratory, Chongqing Academy of Cinsese Materia Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource, National Resource Centtr for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Ming", "ForeName": "Xing-Jia", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource, Endangered Medicinal Breeding National Engineering Laboratory, Chongqing Academy of Cinsese Materia Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource, National Resource Centtr for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Ji-Feng", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource, Endangered Medicinal Breeding National Engineering Laboratory, Chongqing Academy of Cinsese Materia Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource, National Resource Centtr for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Mi", "ForeName": "Ben-Zhong", "Initials": "BZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Luohu Agricultural Development Co., Ltd., Chongqing 404038, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Yi-Bo", "Initials": "YB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29945397", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180329.005"]}}]}
