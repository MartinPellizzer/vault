Obesity is a global health problem caused by excessive fat accumulation linked to abnormal lipid metabolism, such as adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and lipolysis. Accordingly, the effects of medicinal plants on obesity-related mechanisms and biomarkers have been evaluated in various experimental studies. For example, adipogenesis and lipogenesis are regulated by several transcription factors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha, and fatty acid synthase. Moreover, activation of the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase pathway is accompanied by promotion of lipolysis. However, few reports have consolidated studies of the effects of various Asian medicinal plants on obesity and related mechanisms. Therefore, in this review, we examined the associations of medicinal plants originating from Asian countries with obesity and discussed the related mechanisms and biomarkers from <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 The Author(s).
