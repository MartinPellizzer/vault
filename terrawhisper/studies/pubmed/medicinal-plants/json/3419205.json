We document how plants are utilized by each culture for nutritional, medicinal, and functional (utilitarian) purposes and aim to investigate if these uses arose independently through a parallel experimentation process or were learned by one tribe from the other. The data suggest that between these two Bedouin groups the utilization of at least 19 of the 21 plant species was independently derived. On the basis of linguistic grounds the use of two plants may have been introduced to the Bischarin by Arabic-speaking people."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109."}], "LastName": "Goodman", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hobbs", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Cultural Comparison"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Egypt"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnicity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3419205", "10.1016/0378-8741(88)90116-x", "0378-8741(88)90116-X"]}}]}
