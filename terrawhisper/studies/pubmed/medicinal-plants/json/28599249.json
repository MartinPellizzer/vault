The characteristic hallmark of PD involves progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA-ergic) neuron in Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) region of the brain, however, aetiology of the disease still remains unclear. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative insult are considered to be the key culprit. The current therapy available for PD primarily relies on Levodopa that offers the potential of slowing down disease progression to some extent but includes lot of side effects. Any potential drug capable of treating or halting the disease still remains to be identified. It is evident that redox stabilization and replenishment of mitochondrial function seem to be an important therapeutic approach against PD as both are required for optimal neuronal functioning. Enormous research done in this field has shown that some natural and synthetic products exhibit neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic potential by improving mitochondrial function and alleviating oxidative stress. Therefore, the present review aims to discuss some of the important medicinal natural herbs (Bacopa monnieri, Mucuna pruriens, Withania somnifera, Curcuma longa, Gingko Biloba, and Camellia sinensis) in context to their neuroprotective potential and also in the development of novel therapeutic strategies against PD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.
