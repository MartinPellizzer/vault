In principle, biological resources are considered similar to any other natural resource with different levels of stake holders. Specific restrictions, however, apply to the export of food crops. Nigeria is a traditional society where most of biodiversity belongs to what could be appropriately classified as public domain. It has therefore not been easy to carve out property rights from what is generally regarded as communal resources. Private access and occupancy of land and tenure are derived mainly from rights of membership of kindred groups or as custodian of \"family' inheritance. The multi-state federal structure allows for negotiations to be conducted mainly at the level of the various State Government Departments responsible for forest resources, and the Federal Government providing the necessary policy guidelines and regulations. The Bioresources Development and Conservation Programme (BDCP), an international NGO based in Nigeria, has adopted an innovative model for biological prospecting based on establishing strategic partnerships and capacity building."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioresources Development and Conservation Programme (BDCP), University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Iwu", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Economics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Education"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Entrepreneurship"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Expeditions"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Forestry"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence", "organization & administration"], "DescriptorName": "Government Agencies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guidelines as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intellectual Property"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Patents as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Policy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Sector"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tropical Medicine"}], "NumberOfReferences": "4"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9213619", "10.1016/0378-8741(95)01364-4", "0378-8741(95)01364-4"]}}]}
