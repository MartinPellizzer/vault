Some also show interesting activities, such as antioxidant and cytotoxic ones. Combining fingerprint technology with data-handling techniques allows indicating the peaks potentially responsible for given activities. In this study it is aspired to indicate from chromatographic fingerprints the peaks potentially responsible for the antioxidant activity of several Mallotus species. Relevant information was extracted using linear multivariate calibration techniques, both before and after alignment of the fingerprints with correlation optimized warping (COW). From the studied techniques, Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression is least recommended as it made an inadequate variable selection. Principal Component Regression theoretically can take largely varying variables uncorrelated to the antioxidant activity into account. However, in practice in the actual case study this problem was limited. These problems in principle do not occur using Partial Least Squares (PLS) models. Of the tested PLS methods, Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures was preferred because of its simplicity, reproducibility, reduced model complexity and improved interpretability of the regression coefficients, yielding a clearer view on the individual contribution of the compounds. Furthermore, reducing analysis times from 60 min to 35 and 22.5 min resulted in the same main compounds, indicated responsible for the antioxidant activity. Models built after alignment by COW did not result in additional information."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Technology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel-VUB, Laarbeeklaan 103, B-1090 Brussels, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tistaert", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dejaegher", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nguyen Hoai", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chataign\u00e9", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rivi\u00e8re", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nguyen Thi Hong", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chau Van", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Quetin-Leclercq", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vander Heyden", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chim Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0370534", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2670"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Anal Chim Acta. 2009 Oct 12;652(1-2):189-97. doi: 10.1016/j.aca.2009.08.024", "PMID": "19786180"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Least-Squares Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mallotus Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Principal Component Analysis"}], "NumberOfReferences": "43"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19664459", "10.1016/j.aca.2009.07.020", "S0003-2670(09)00926-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
