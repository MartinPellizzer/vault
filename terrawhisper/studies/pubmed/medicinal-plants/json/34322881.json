The most used insect repellents are synthetic derivatives; however, these have an adverse effect on human health as well as on the environment. Therefore, we attempted to find materials with insect repellent activity in natural products. The present study aimed to identify the single chemical component with intense insect repellent activity in extracts from four different Oriental medicinal plant materials: (i) Anethum graveolens L. (dill) seeds; (ii) Artemisia capillaris Thunb. (capillary wormwood) leaves; (iii) smoked Prunus mume Siebold & Zucc. (mume) fruits; and (iv) Rhus javanica L. (galls).", "As a result of the bioassay-guided fractionation of each extract against the Plodia interpunctella, stored-product insect, the n-hexane fraction of dill seeds extract was confirmed as the optimal fraction between all of the fractions. In total, 32 chemical components were identified from the n-hexane fraction of dill seeds by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, and the two main components were dillapiole (47.51%) and carvone (26.76%). Of the two components, dillapiole was confirmed as the key component playing an essential role in insect repellent activity.", "Our study suggests that dillapiole has the potential to be used as a natural insect repellent for the control of P. interpunctella infestation in agricultural and food products during distribution and storage. \u00a9 2021 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jung-Soo", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Junhyuk", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Inyoung", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Nutrition, Kookmin University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Yoonjee", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agency for Korea National Food Cluster (AnFC), Iksan, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Chan Suk", "Initials": "CS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3199-889X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Biosciences and Technology, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Jaejoon", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Biomedical Science and Food Safety, Korea University Food Safety Hall", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "118048-03", "Agency": "Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "Korea University", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2020R1F1A1073901", "Agency": "National Research Foundation of Korea", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insect Repellents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anethum graveolens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Brucea javanica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Insect Repellents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lepidoptera"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Prunus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Gupta AK, Yadav D, Gupta P, Ranjan S, Gupta V and Badhai S, Effects of climate change on agriculture.
