Their antidiabetic effects were evaluated by the stimulation of GLP-1 secretion in STC-1 cells and inhibition against four diabetes-related enzymes, GPa, \u03b1-glucosidase, PTP1B, and DPP4. Compounds 1-5 and 7-10 significantly stimulated GLP-1 secretion by 267.5-433.1% (25.0\u00a0\u03bcM) and 117.8-348.2% (12.5\u00a0\u03bcM). Compounds 1-4 exhibited significant inhibition on GPa with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 18.0-31.3\u00a0\u03bcM; compounds 1-5 showed obvious inhibition on \u03b1-glucosidase with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 6.9-18.2\u00a0\u03bcM; compounds 1-5 and 10 possessed PTP1B inhibitory activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 35.5 to 80.1\u00a0\u03bcM. This investigation first disclosed compounds 1-4 as intriguing GLP-1 secretagogues and GPa, \u03b1-glucosidase, and PTP1B inhibitors, which provided valuable clues for searching multiple-target antidiabetic candidates from Zingiberaceae plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
