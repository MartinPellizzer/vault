Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), wound healing, and protein expressions were determined following standard protocols. For the in vivo pilot study, the syngeneic BALB/c mouse model was used. 4T1 cells were injected into mammary fat pads. Tumors were allowed to grow for 9 days before gavage treatment with CphE (150 mg GAE/kg/day) or PBS (controls) for one week. Excised tumors, liver, and lungs were analyzed for gene and protein expression and histology.", "In vitro results showed that CphE suppressed cell viability through apoptosis induction, via caspase-3 cleavage and total PARP reduction. CphE also scavenged ROS and suppressed Akt, mTOR, ERK1/2, CREB, and Src activation contributing to cell motility inhibition. CphE reduced IR, PTEN, TSC2, p70S6, and RPS6, protein levels, which are proteins involved in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, suggesting this pathway as CphE primary target. In vivo results showed downregulation of ERK1/2 activation by phosphorylation in tumor tissues, accompanied by angiogenesis reduction in tumor and lung tissues. A reduction of Cenpf mRNA levels in liver and lung tissues strongly suggested anti-invasive cancer activity of CphE.", "CphE inhibited 4T1 cell signal pathways that play a key role in cell growth and invasion. The potential for in vitro results to be translated in vivo was confirmed. A complete animal study is a guarantee to confirm the CphE anticancer and antimetastatic activity in vivo."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Stem Cell, University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), S\u00e3o Paulo, 05508 270, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Rabelo", "ForeName": "Ana Carolina Silveira", "Initials": "ACS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Stem Cell, University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), S\u00e3o Paulo, 05508 270, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Miglino", "ForeName": "Maria Ang\u00e9lica", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agrilife, Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, Texas, 77843-2253, United States."}], "LastName": "Arbizu", "ForeName": "Shirley", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Stem Cell, University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), S\u00e3o Paulo, 05508 270, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Carreira", "ForeName": "Ana Cl\u00e1udia O", "Initials": "ACO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Maranh\u00e3o, Campus S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds- Monte Castelo, Maranh\u00e3o, 65030-005, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Filho", "ForeName": "Ant\u00f4nio Jos\u00e9 Cantanhede", "Initials": "AJC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Maranh\u00e3o, Campus S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds- Monte Castelo, Maranh\u00e3o, 65030-005, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Carneiro", "ForeName": "Fernando Jos\u00e9 Costa", "Initials": "FJC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47906, United States."}], "LastName": "Layosa", "ForeName": "Marjorie Anne A", "Initials": "MAA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agrilife, Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, Texas, 77843-2253, United States."}], "LastName": "Noratto", "ForeName": "Giuliana", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101265649", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calotropis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35676853", "10.2174/1871520622666220608122154", "ACAMC-EPUB-124265"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
