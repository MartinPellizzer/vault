Alarming adverse effects of overuse of statins has been reported for patients with dyslipidemia. This study was aimed to identify compounds with potent anti-dyslipidemic property from selected plants and analyze them for their efficiency in binding with HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in lipid metabolism. The docking studies indicate rutin as the best compound that can inhibit HMG-CoA reductase as it had strong binding affinity to the enzyme. The molecular dynamics simulation studies confirmed the stability of the HMG-CoA reductase-rutin complex. RMSD, RMSF, Rg, H-bond results indicated that the HMG-CoA reductase-rutin complex is highly stable. Presently, statins are not preferred for individuals with pre-existing liver disease. Our study identified rutin as a promising lead compound which could be further developed into an anti-dyslipidemic molecule. Our results will be a good starting point for future experimental and clinical studies and if the results from such studies match international standards plant derived rutin might emerge as a good alternative to statins.
