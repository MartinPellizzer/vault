SHN virgin mice were divided into 6 groups at 3 months of age and treated with the samples in drinking water as shown in Table 2 for 8 weeks. Each sample was extracted repeatedly with hot water, dried in vacuo and dissolved with tap water at the concentration indicated in Table 2. Normal and preneoplastic mammary gland growth and thymidylate synthetase activity in the mammary gland were inhibited by Gmt alone; but its effect was affected slightly by the further addition of other products. However, the excretion of urinary components, which is abnormally low in SHN mice, was gradually enhanced by the addition of other products to Gmt and was highest by SLWLQY. The elongated estrous/metestrous stage of the estrous cycle induced by Gmt+Zq was returned to the control level by further addition of other products and by SLWLQY. The normal parameters in this strain during this age period such as body weight change, food and water intake and immune system were affected little by all treatments. All these findings strongly suggest that one of the principles of prescribing Chinese herbal medicines is to normalize the physical conditions, which, in turn, contributes to therapy and protection from diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Experimental Animal Research Laboratory, Meiji University, Kawasaki, Japan."}], "LastName": "Nagasawa", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sakamoto", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamamoto", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Inatomi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Am J Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7901431", "ISSNLinking": "0192-415X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Nonesterified"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-62-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Prolactin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.1.45", "NameOfSubstance": "Thymidylate Synthase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "CD4-CD8 Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Estrus"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Nonesterified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Mammary Glands, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mammary Neoplasms, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Precancerous Conditions"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Prolactin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thymidylate Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Urine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9167000", "10.1142/S0192415X97000111", "S0192415X97000111"]}}]}
