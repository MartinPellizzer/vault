It is a major factor behind the development of diabetes and the reasons can be genetics, environmental factors, dietary choices and obesity. Many medicinal plants have anti-diabetic potential. This study investigated the anti-hyperglycemic effect of apple peel extract. This study also investigated the chemical characterization of apple peel. Phytochemicals including total phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Encapsulated 350mg/day was given to treatment groups. Random blood sugar, fasting blood sugar and HbA1c of 45 diabetic female adults was measured on the 0-day and 45<sup>th</sup> day. Results showed that apple peel contained moisture (14.71\u00b13.57)%, ash (17.82\u00b12.13)%, nitrogen free extract (32.12\u00b13.52)%, crude protein (6.89\u00b10.83)%, crude fiber (19.17\u00b10.21)% and crude fat (9.91\u00b12.31)%. Findings showed that apple peel contains magnesium (6.61\u00b11.088), calcium (8.17\u00b10.32), zinc (14.08\u00b11.21) and potassium (67.21\u00b11.86). These findings were shown in mg in kg. Apple peel extract contained total phenolic content (TPC) of 8.14\u00b11.07 and total phenolic content (TFC) of 4.89\u00b11.81. Apple peel extract showed a significant reduction in all blood parameters of hyperglycemia. All results were significant at p<0.05."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BHU Budh Ghulam, Vehari, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Iftikhar", "ForeName": "Zaheen Aysha", "Initials": "ZA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BHU Meeray Shah Tehsil Sadiqabad, Rahim Yar Khan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shahid", "ForeName": "Urwah", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "DHQ Teaching Hospital, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Farooq", "ForeName": "Madiha", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kuwait Teaching Hospital, Peshawar Medical College, Peshawar, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Kamila", "ForeName": "Haleema", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, HBS Medical and Dental College, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Nusrat", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Amna Inayat Medical College, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Mastoor", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Microbiology, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Almutairi", "ForeName": "Saeedah Musaed", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Histology & Cell Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, King Salman International University, South Sinai, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ahmed Rasheed", "ForeName": "Rabab", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Tse-Wei", "Initials": "TW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Malus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperglycemia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "10"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "49"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37548200"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
