The molecular mass was estimated to be approximately 25,000 Da by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration. The extinction coefficient (epsilon 280 nm 1%) of the enzyme was 24.6. The enzyme hydrolyzed denatured natural substrates like casein, hemoglobin, azoalbumin, and azocasein with a high specific activity but showed low specific activity towards synthetic substrates. The pH and temperature optima were 7.5-8.0 and 50 degrees C respectively. The activity of the enzyme was strongly inhibited by thiol-specific inhibitors like leupeptin, iodoacetamide, PCMB, NEM, and mercuric chloride. The striking property of this enzyme was its stability over a wide pH range (2-12) and other extreme conditions of temperature, denaturants, and organic solvents. The N-terminal sequence showed marked similarity to known cysteine proteases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Biology Unit, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India."}], "LastName": "Sundd", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kundu", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pal", "ForeName": "G P", "Initials": "GP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Medicherla", "ForeName": "J V", "Initials": "JV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biosci Biotechnol Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9205717", "ISSNLinking": "0916-8451"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Latex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Cysteine Endopeptidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "ervatamin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cysteine Endopeptidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Latex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9836431", "10.1271/bbb.62.1947"]}}]}
