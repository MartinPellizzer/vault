It has been claimed to be effective for dyspepsia. The studies done so far showed no toxicity due to consuming Curcuma domestica Val. The plant has been found to contain volatile oil and curcuminoids which are believed to be the active ingredients. The objective of the study was to test the efficacy of Curcuma domestica Val. rhizome for treatment of dyspepsia compared with a placebo and flatulence in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial carried out in one provincial and 5 community hospitals. One hundred and sixteen adult patients who had acid dyspepsia, flatulent dyspepsia, or atonic dyspepsia were included in the study. Forty-one (41) patients were in the placebo group, 36 and 39 were in the flatulence and Curcuma domestica Val. groups respectively. Each patient received 2 capsules of placebo or study drugs 4 times a day for 7 days. Each patient was then assessed for symptoms response, side effects and satisfaction. Ten patients did not participate in the follow-up. The baseline characteristics of the patients among the three groups were not significantly different. Fifty-three (53) per cent of the patients receiving placebo responded to the treatment whereas 83 per cent of the patients receiving flatulence and 87 per cent of patients receiving Curcuma domestica Val. responded to the treatment. The differences in efficacy between placebo and active drugs were statistically significant and clinically important. Mild and self-limited side effects were observed at similar frequency in the three groups. About 50 per cent of the patients in each group were satisfied with the treatment they received.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thamlikitkul", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bunyapraphatsara", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dechatiwongse", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Theerapong", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chantrakul", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thanaveerasuwan", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nimitnon", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Boonroj", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Punkrut", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gingsungneon", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Multicenter Study", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Thailand", "MedlineTA": "J Med Assoc Thai", "NlmUniqueID": "7507216", "ISSNLinking": "0125-2208"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dyspepsia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multicenter Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2699615"]}}]}
