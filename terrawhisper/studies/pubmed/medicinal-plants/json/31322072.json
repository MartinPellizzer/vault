Several essential oils or plant extracts have been found to have anti-Acanthamoeba properties against trophozoites and cysts of Acanthamoeba spp.", "The aim of this systematic review is to introduce anti-Acanthamoeba properties of some essential oils or plant extracts; perhaps the results of this research will be used to prevent and treat infectious diseases.", "All published papers in English and Persian databases were systematically searched for some specific keywords to find articles that have influenced plant compounds on Acanthamoeba up to April 2018. Articles related to the subject were selected and studied.", "A total of 51 articles including 136 experiments (128 in vitro and 8 in vivo) between 1999 and 2018, met our eligibility criteria. Totally, 110 species of plants belonging to 34 families, mainly Lamiaceae (15 plant species) and Asteraceae (13 plant species) were studied against trophozoites and cysts of Acanthamoba in in vitro and in vivo. Most of the plant's species were Citrus (6 species), Allium (5 species), Peucedanum, Piper, Lippia, and Olive (4 species). The most frequently used parts were leaves, aerial parts, flowers, bark, rhizomes, and seeds.", "Recent studies have shown that many natural compounds have high anti-parasitic properties and low toxicity. Our research team hopes that the information provided in present systematic review can improve new experimental and clinical trials and herbal combination therapy. Further studies are needed to understand the molecular mechanisms in the anti-amoebic reactions of plant species and ocular toxicity of extracts in animal models."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Parasitology and Entomology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Chegeni", "ForeName": "Tooran Nayeri", "Initials": "TN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxoplasmosis Research Center, Department of Parasitology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fakhar", "ForeName": "Mahdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Parasitology and Entomology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaffarifar", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxoplasmosis Research Center, Department of Parasitology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Saberi", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "52/8635", "Agency": "Tarbiat Modares University", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Infect Disord Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "101269158", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5265"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Acanthamoeba"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Amebiasis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trophozoites"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31322072", "10.2174/1871526519666190716095849", "IDDT-EPUB-99642"]}}]}
