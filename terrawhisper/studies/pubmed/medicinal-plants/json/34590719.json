However, the data related to metabolites is often too large, making it difficult to screen quickly, accurately and comprehensively various differential compounds. In this study, a high-throughput screening method for differential secondary metabolites produced by medicinal plants under environmental stress has been developed based on ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF) and automatic data analysis strategy. This work uses Sorbus pohuashanensis cells with biotic stress (Harpin protein) and abiotic stress (Cd<sup>2+</sup> ) as potential environmental stress factors. The results showed that S. pohuashanensis cells could rapidly respond to both Harpin protein and Cd<sup>2+</sup> within 24\u2009h, and a significant positive correlation was observed between their concentration (within a certain range) and induction time. The proposed screening method can automatically screen the bulk UHPLC-QTOF metabolic data for differential compounds with high-throughput, and also perform preliminary identification of their possible structures. The screening results indicated that the stress response of S. pohuashanensis cells to Cd<sup>2+</sup> was significantly higher than that of Harpin protein, and all of them could produce a series of biphenyls, terpenes, and other phytoalexins with stress-resistance and physiological functional properties. Overall, the screening method provides an efficient and powerful tool to study the response mechanisms of plants to environmental stress, to improve the resistance of medicinal plants and also to select and breed high-quality Chinese medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jiaxing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Sheng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Liangyun", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Chuanzhi", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6974-1411"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lanping", "Initials": "L"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2018KQNCX133", "Agency": "Guangdong Provincial Youth Innovation Talents Program", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2017YFC1700701", "Agency": "National Key R&D Program of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2020YFC1712700", "Agency": "National Key R&D Program of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "81891014", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "ZZXT201906", "Agency": "The Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Public Welfare Research Institutes", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Physiol Plant", "NlmUniqueID": "1256322", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9317"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "High-Throughput Screening Assays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sorbus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Aminfar, P., Abtahi, M. & Parastar, H.
