Recent evidence has indicated that elderly people with dementia are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 and severe disease outcomes. However, its molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we retrieved frontal cortex samples of COVID-19 patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus\u00a0database and performed a systematic transcriptomic analysis to compare COVID-19 patients and controls with or without dementia. In nondemented patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection obviously activated T helper type 2 (Th2) cell-mediated humoral immunity and reduced the pathogenesis of dementia-related Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In demented patients, conversely, SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased T helper type 1 (Th1) cell-mediated cellular immunity and exacerbated the progression of dementia-related diseases. We further analyzed the molecular characteristics of COVID-19 patients with and without dementia. Compared with nondemented COVID-19 patients, demented COVID-19 patients showed decreased enrichment scores of Calcium signaling pathway, Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, ABC transporters, and Peroxisome, and increased enrichment scores of Olfactory transduction and Regulation of autophagy. The ratio of Th1/Th2 cells was significantly increased from 1.17 in nondemented COVID-19 patients to 33.32 in demented COVID-19 patients. Taken together, our findings provide transcriptomic evidence that COVID-19 has distinct influences on cognitive function and immune response in patients with and without dementia."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academic of Sciences, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Ministry of Education & Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jue", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9204-0960"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Ministry of Education & Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academic of Sciences, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Xiaojiang", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "7705876", "ISSNLinking": "0146-6615"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dementia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cognition"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "World Health Organization.
