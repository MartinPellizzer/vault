The produced dialdehyde basil seed gum (DBSG) was collected and its physicochemical properties were determined. Fitting of quadratic, linear polynomial equations was subsequently done by considering the insignificant lack of fit, as well as highly considerable R<sup>2</sup>, in order to probe the probable relationship existing between these considered variables as well as the obtained responses. So the considered optimal related test conditions, which included pH\u00a0=\u00a03, T\u00a0=\u00a045\u00a0\u00b0C as well as Time\u00a0=\u00a03\u00a0h, were specified to produce the highest percentage of aldehyde (DBSG32), optimal (DBSG34) and the (DBSG74) samples with the highest viscosity. The results obtained by FTIR and aldehyde content determination provided the indication that dialdehyde groups were formed in a way that was in equilibrium with the considered the hemiacetal form which was dominant. Furthermore, AFM investigation related to the considered DBSG34 sample displayed over-oxidation as well as depolymerization; this might be due to the enhanced hydrophobic qualities, as well as the decreased viscosity. While the DBSG34 sample had the most dialdehyde factor group with a particular tendency for the combination having the proteins' amino group, DBSG32 and DBSG74 samples could be desirable for industrial uses owing to no overoxidation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
