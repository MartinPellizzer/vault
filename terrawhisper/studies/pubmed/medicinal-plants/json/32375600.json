The present investigation is mainly aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of the above bioactive compound against ketamine-induced schizophrenia with particular reference to catecholaminergic metabolism using <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> and <i>in silico</i> methods. Ketamine-induced schizophrenia caused significant elevation in biogenic amines (epinephrine, nor epinephrine, dopamine and 5-HT) and monoamine oxidase activity levels which were restored to normal during the treatment with the bioactive compound akin to the reference compound, clozapine. In addition, the compound has shown highest binding score against all the biogenic amine receptors viz. D1, D2, D3, D4 and serotonin receptor, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> with lowest inhibition constant values than the reference compound, clozapine. The present findings suggest that modulation of CNS monoamine neurotransmitter system might partly contribute to the impairments associated with schizophrenia and the plant compound alleviates the monoaminergic abnormalities associated with the neurological dysfunction.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
