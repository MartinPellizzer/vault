While tobacco contributes to over 90% of cases, factors like dietary choices and radiation exposure also play a role. Despite potential benefits from early detection, cancer patients face hurdles, including drug resistance, chemotherapy side effects, high treatment costs, and limited healthcare access. Traditional medicinal plant knowledge has recently unveiled diverse cancer chemopreventive agents from terrestrial and marine sources. These phytochemicals regulate intricate molecular processes, influencing the immune system, apoptosis, cell cycle, proliferation, carcinogen elimination, and antioxidant levels. In pursuing cutting-edge strategies to combat the diverse forms of cancer, technological advancements have spurred innovative approaches. Researchers have focused on the green synthesis of metallic nanoparticles using plant metabolites. This method offers distinct advantages over conventional physical and chemical synthesis techniques, such as cost-effectiveness, biocompatibility, and energy efficiency. Metallic nanoparticles, through various pathways such as the generation of reactive oxygen species, modulation of enzyme activity, DNA fragmentation, disruption of signaling pathways, perturbation of cell membranes, and interference with mitochondrial function resulting in DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, exhibit significant potential for preventive applications. Thus, the amalgamation of phytocompounds and metallic nanoparticles holds promise as a novel approach to lung cancer therapy. However, further refinements and advancements are necessary to enhance the environmentally friendly process of metallic nanoparticle synthesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
