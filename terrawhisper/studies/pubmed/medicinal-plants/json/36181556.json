The soil was irrigated with three different dilutions of tannery wastewater viz. 50%, 75% and 100% of tannery effluents (T, UD and U) including control. The maximum herbal biomass (105.17\u00a0g plant<sup>-1</sup>) was found in UD100. Although oil quality was not affected by application of tannery effluents, the oil yield was decreased significantly, as compared to control, in all treatments except in UD75. The chromium concentration in different plant parts was in order of root\u2009>\u2009shoot\u2009>\u2009leaf. This indicates O. basilicum is an effective aromatic crop for remediation of tannery affected sites without any effect on crop growth, oil yield per unit area and oil quality and increase in soil fertility."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022.
