Twenty-eight populations of wild origin and 4 registered cultivars ('Soroks\u00e1ri 40', 'Lutea', 'Goral' and 'Bona') were evaluated in open field experiments. It could be established that the experimental populations represented different genetic potential for essential oil accumulation and composition. The best populations of wild growing origin from the Somogy-region and four cultivars produced the highest essential oil contents (above 0.6 g/100g) in each year. Additionally, the quality of the characteristic main compound of the oil determining the \"chemotype\", according to Schilcher, was found to be stable during the three years period. However, the actual chemosyndroms are significantly influenced by the weather conditions. In the three years' experiment, the moderately warm and relatively wet year of 2006 produced the highest contents of essential oil and also that of its alpha-bisabolol component. Although bisabolol oxide A also showed a high variability through the years, its direct connection with weather conditions could not be proved. A moderate variability was established for the proportions of chamazulene, and the lowest one for bisabolol-oxide B. Considerable genotype-weather interaction was supposed, especially for the essential oil content and for the ratio of bisabolol-oxide A."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Corvinus University of Budapest, Vill\u00e1nyi Str. 29-43, 1118, Hungary. beata.gosztola@uni-corvinus.hu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gosztola", "ForeName": "Be\u00e1ta", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00e1rosi", "ForeName": "Szilvia", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "N\u00e9meth", "ForeName": "Eva", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Commun", "NlmUniqueID": "101477873", "ISSNLinking": "1555-9475"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azulenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monocyclic Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "24WE03BX2T", "NameOfSubstance": "bisabolol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z439UH6E5F", "NameOfSubstance": "chamazulene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Azulenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hungary"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Matricaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monocyclic Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20420329"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
