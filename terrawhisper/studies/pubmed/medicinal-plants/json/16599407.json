Recent data shows over 250 ecdysteroid analogs have been identified so far in plants. It is theorized that there are over 1000 possible structures, which might occur in nature, but it is a fact that ecdysteroids usually occur in plants as a complex cocktail of structurally different compounds. Among these compounds, the major component is usually the common ecdysteroid-like 20-hydroxyecdysone. Ecdysteroids are polar steroids, almost sugar-like in their solubility properties. Extraction and purification of ecdysteroids (polyhydroxy steroids) is complicated by their polar nature and poor crystallizing properties. These properties make them difficult to separate from other polar plant constituents. Besides, this plant extract is very often processed by multistep procedures to isolate the major and minor ecdysteroids from the new or existing sources. A simplified scheme consisting of a few extraction steps for the purification of ecdysteroid from plants is in great demand. A quantitative approach through high-performance liquid chromatography has been initiated for developing an easy method for the extraction of ecdysteroids from Ipomoea hederacea (kaladana) seeds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Natural Product Research Laboratory, Pharmaceutical Division, UICT, Mumbai-400 019, India. dipankarghosh2001@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghosh", "ForeName": "Dipankar", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laddha", "ForeName": "K S", "Initials": "KS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0173225", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9665"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytosterols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "phytoecdysones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3604-87-3", "NameOfSubstance": "Ecdysone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ecdysone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ipomoea"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytosterols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16599407", "10.1093/chromsci/44.1.22"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
