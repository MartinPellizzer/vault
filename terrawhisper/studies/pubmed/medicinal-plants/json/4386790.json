The pH optima of the purified diaphorases were similar, but the purified diaphorases from the optochin-resistant strains were approximately four to five times more resistant to heat inactivation at 45 C than was the wild-type diaphorase. Purified diaphorase preparations from the optochin-resistant pneumococci had greater activities per milligram of protein and were more resistant to optochin inhibition than the preparation from the optochin-sensitive pneumococcus. Michaelis constants for FMN and NADH were similar; however, the inhibition constants of the optochin-resistant diaphorases were four to eight times greater than that of the optochin-sensitive diaphorase. Optochin hydrochloride produced a noncompetitive type of inhibition with FMN as substrate but a competitive type of inhibition with NADH as substrate. Optochin hydrochloride produced an approximately 10-fold increase in the Michaelis constant for NADH. The concentration of drug required to produce this effect was, however, greater with the mutant diaphorases than with the wild-type diaphorase. Optochin hydrochloride quenched the fluorescence of riboflavine. This phenomenon did not appear to be related to the diaphorase-inhibitory activity of the drug, however, since the pH requirements of the two reactions were different. Quenching of riboflavine fluorescence by optochin hydrochloride increased with a rise in pH, whereas inhibition of diaphorase activity by optochin hydrochloride was greater at pH 6.8 than at pH 7.6."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kreger", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olsen", "ForeName": "R H", "Initials": "RH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Bacteriol", "NlmUniqueID": "2985120R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9193"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0U46U6E8UK", "NameOfSubstance": "NAD"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7N464URE7E", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavin Mononucleotide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.8.1.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Dihydrolipoamide Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TLM2976OFR", "NameOfSubstance": "Riboflavin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cinchona"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Dihydrolipoamide Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Flavin Mononucleotide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NAD"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Riboflavin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Streptococcus pneumoniae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1953 Jun;202(2):675-85", "ArticleIdList": ["13061491"]}, {"Citation": "J Bacteriol. 1948 Dec;56(6):723-35", "ArticleIdList": ["16561625"]}, {"Citation": "J Bacteriol. 1948 Dec;56(6):737-48", "ArticleIdList": ["16561626"]}, {"Citation": "J Bacteriol. 1966 Nov;92(5):1404-14", "ArticleIdList": ["5924271"]}, {"Citation": "J Bacteriol. 1968 Oct;96(4):1021-8", "ArticleIdList": ["4386789"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem J. 1951 Apr;48(4):458-67", "ArticleIdList": ["14838867"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1966 Mar 10;241(5):1043-8", "ArticleIdList": ["4379861"]}, {"Citation": "Biochemistry. 1967 Aug;6(8):2561-70", "ArticleIdList": ["6058124"]}, {"Citation": "Fed Proc. 1961 Dec;20:1005-11", "ArticleIdList": ["14042380"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1951 Nov;193(1):265-75", "ArticleIdList": ["14907713"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1968", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1968", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1968", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1968", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4386790", "PMC252414", "10.1128/jb.96.4.1029-1036.1968"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
