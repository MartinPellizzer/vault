In light of limitations in conventional chemotherapies or radiotherapies, cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a potent strategy in treating cancer. In cancer immunotherapy, preliminary studies have demonstrated that cancer immune surveillance serves a crucial role in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. Herbal medicines and natural products, which serve as alternative medicines, are involved in the modulation of tumor immunosurveillance to enhance antitumor activity. Accordingly, this review aimed to summarize the modulation function of herbal medicines and natural products on tumor immunosurveillance while providing scientific insight into further research on its molecular mechanism and potential clinical applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a92022 Society for Leukocyte Biology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chinese Medicine, College of Chinese Medicine Material, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chinese medicine, College of Medicine, Changchun Science-Technology University, Changchun, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine and State Key Laboratory of Research on Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Huihai", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chinese medicine, College of Medicine, Changchun Science-Technology University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lulu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chinese Medicine, College of Chinese Medicine Material, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Leukoc Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8405628", "ISSNLinking": "0741-5400"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunologic Surveillance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Henley SJ, Thomas CC, Ward DRLEM, et\u00a0al.
