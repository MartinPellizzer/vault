In order to determine the litholytic potential of the extract, Calcium oxalate urinary stones were incubated during 12 weeks under continuous shaking in the presence of AME, Rowanix or NaCl 9 g/mL solution were used as controls. After the incubation period, the residual weight of the treated calculi was determined and the rate of dissolution was calculated. The medium pH variation was measured and changes in the calcium oxalate crystals at the stone surface were assessed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results showed a significant dissolution effect for the extract on the kidney calculi during the experimentation period. At the end of the experiment, the percentages of calculi weight decrease were 41.23, 4.97 and 55.67% for the extract, NaCl solution and Rowanix, respectively. Gas Chromatography analysis revealed mainly the presence of the following phyto-compounds: Cyclopropenone, 2,3-diphenyl; 1-Nonadecanol; methyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside; cis-9-Hexadecenal. These compounds unarguably play crucial roles in the health care system especially in cancer treatment and many other diseases including urolithiasis. The urinary stone dissolution, independent of medium pH, could be attributed to formation of complexes between the phytochemical compounds in the extract and the calculi."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9454-6295"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Faisal University, College of Sciences, Department of Biological Sciences, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Biotechnology, Laboratory of Aromatic and Medicinal Plants, Hammam-Lif, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Ammar", "ForeName": "Rebai Ben", "Initials": "RB"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4272-929X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Faisal University, College of Sciences, Department of Biological Sciences, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beni-Suef University, Faculty of Science, Botany and Microbiology Department, Beni-Suef, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Khalifa", "ForeName": "Ashraf", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2943-0410"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Faisal University, College of Sciences, Department of Biological Sciences, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alamer", "ForeName": "Sarah Abdulaziz", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8936-2598"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Faisal University, College of Sciences, Department of Physics, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Seyed Ghazanfar", "Initials": "SG"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1143-7633"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Faisal University, College of Sciences, Department of Chemistry, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Siegen, Department of Chemistry and Biology, Adolf-Reichwein-Str. 2, D-57076 Siegen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Hafez", "ForeName": "Aly M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6354-4388"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Faisal University, College of Sciences, Department of Biological Sciences, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Rajendran", "ForeName": "Peramaiyan", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101129542", "ISSNLinking": "1519-6984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "2612HC57YE", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Oxalate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "451W47IQ8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Oxalate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calculi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saudi Arabia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Urolithiasis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "53"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35588519", "10.1590/1519-6984.259100", "S1519-69842024000100280"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
