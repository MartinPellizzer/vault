Male Wistar rats were divided into sea level (n = 9), hypoxic (n = 8). Chinese herbs (n = 15), Vp (n = 20) and herbs + Vp (n = 18) groups. All the rats, except the SL group, were placed in a hypobaric chamber simulating an altitude of 5000 m above sea level for 15 days. During this time, the aforementioned drugs were given i.p. bid every day. It was found that apparent increase of PAP and decrease of IC-R (index of contractility of right ventricle) were induced by hypoxia without significant change of CAP, HR or left ventricular function. Both \"Qi-Xue\" injection and Vp minimized the increase in PAP due to hypoxia, with the former being more effective than the latter. \"Qi-Xue\" injection also attenuated IC-R decrease and kept it in the normal range. No appreciable differences were observed between the effect of \"Qi-Xue\" and its combination with Vp. It is suggested that \"Qi-Xue\" injection might prevent the development of severe hypoxic pulmonary hypertension by improving heart function."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Yi Xue Ke Xue Yuan Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "8006230", "ISSNLinking": "1000-503X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CJ0O37KU29", "NameOfSubstance": "Verapamil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension, Pulmonary"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoxia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Verapamil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2140724"]}}]}
