The prepared guanine-MOF was characterized by using X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) techniques. The morphology of prepared material was sponge-shaped which it was well documented, together with the presence of existing functional groups. The effect of prepared material on oprD Gene Expression was investigated in Clinical and Standard Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO-1) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of prepared samples against P. aeruginosa strains were determined through the broth micro-dilution method. The expression of oprD gene in strains affected by Cu-H<sub>2</sub>bpdc-Gu was quantitatively investigated through real-time PCR. MIC of Bio-Cu-H<sub>2</sub>bpdc-Gu was 400\u202f\u03bcg/mL for the standard and clinical strains of P. aeruginosa, while, MBC of this compound was 700\u202f\u03bcg/mL for standard strain and 800\u202f\u03bcg/mL for clinical strains. The highest and the lowest rate of oprD gene expression were found to be 3.6 and 1.1 fold in the strains, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
