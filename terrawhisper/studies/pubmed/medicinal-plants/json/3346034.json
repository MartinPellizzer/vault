The decocainized leaves were formulated in a honey-water vehicle and fed on a chronic basis to female rats for 32 weeks and female rabbits for 13 weeks. Rabbits fed decocainized leaves at doses of 21 or 210 mg demonstrated no significant change in growth (weight gain) when compared with those receiving vehicle. Histological findings were unremarkable except for fatty islands in the myocardium. Rats fed the decocainized leaves at doses of 1.5 and 15 mg demonstrated no significant changes in weight, whereas those receiving 150 mg had a significant decrease in weight gain when compared with control animals receiving vehicle. Necropsy findings in rats demonstrated pyometra in all groups receiving decocainized leaves as well as in some of the controls. Those rats with pyometra often exhibited endometrial metaplasia. Renal tubular calcification and proteinaceous material were consistently noted at all dose levels. Portal triaditis was also found in the livers of most rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Oral Roberts University School of Medicine, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74171."}], "LastName": "Valentine", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fremming", "ForeName": "B D", "Initials": "BD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chappell", "ForeName": "R H", "Initials": "RH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stephen", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hum Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8206759", "ISSNLinking": "0144-5952"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiomyopathies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Growth"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Tubules"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Uterine Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3346034", "10.1177/096032718800700104"]}}]}
