In August 2021, leaf spot was observed on P. notoginseng leaves in Lincang sanqi base (23\u00ba43\u00b410\u02ddN, 100\u00ba7\u00b432\u02ddE, 13.33 hm2). Symptoms expanded from water soaked areas on the leaves to form irregular round or oval leaf spots with transparent or grayish-brown centers containing black granular matter, with an incidence of 10 to 20%. To identify the causal agent, ten symptomatic leaves were randomly selected from ten P. notoginseng plants. Symptomatic leaves were cut into small pieces (5 mm2) with asymptomatic tissue margins, disinfected in 75% ethanol for 30s and in 2% sodium hypochlorite for 3 min, and rinsed three times with sterile distilled water. The tissue portions were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates incubated at 20\u2103 with a 12 h light/dark photoperiod. Seven pure isolates were obtained with similar colony morphology, dark gray (top view) or taupe (back view) coloration, with flat and villous surfaces. Pycnidia were globose to subglobose, glabrous or with few mycelial outgrowths, dark brown to black, 22.46 to 155.94 (av. 69.57) \u00b5m \u00d7 18.20 to 130.5 (av. 57.65) \u00b5m (n=50) in size. Conidia were ellipsoidal to cylindrical, thinwalled, smooth, hyaline, aseptate, and measured 1.47 to 6.81 (av. 4.29) \u00b5m long and 1.01 to 2.97 (av. 1.98) \u00b5m thick (n=100). The isolated strains were preliminarily identified as Boeremia sp. based on the morphological characteristics of colonies and conidia. (Aveskamp et al. 2010; Schaffrath et al. 2021). To confirm pathogen identity, the total genomic DNA of two isolates (LYB-2 and LYB-3) was extracted using the T5 Direct PCR kit. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS), 28S large subunit nrRNA gene (LSU), and \u03b2-tubulin (TUB2) gene regions were PCR-amplified using primers ITS1/ITS4, LR0Rf/LR5r, and BT2F/BT4R (Chen et al. 2015), respectively. Sequences have been deposited in GenBank (ON908942-ON908943 for ITS, ON908944-ON908945 for LSU, ON929285-ON929286 for TUB2). BLASTn searches of generated DNA sequences from 2 purified isolates (LYB-2 and LYB-3) against GenBank showed high similarity (>99%) with the sequences of Boeremia linicola. Moreover, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the neighbor-joining method in MEGA-X (Kumar et al. 2018) and revealed that the 2 isolates were closest to B. linicola (CBS 116.76). Pathogenicity tests were conducted with the 2 isolates (LYB-2 and LYB-3) as described by Cai et al. (2009) with slight modifications. Each isolate was inoculated with three healthy annual P. notoginseng plants, and each leaf was inoculated with three drops of conidia suspension (106 spores/mL). Three P. notoginseng plants inoculated with sterile water were used as controls. All plants were covered with plastic bags incubated in a greenhouse (20\u2103, 90%RH, 12 h light/dark photoperiod). Fifteen days post-inoculation, all inoculated leaves showed similar lesions, and the symptoms were identical to those in the field. The pathogen was reisolated from symptomatic leaf spots, and the colony characteristics were identical to the original isolates. Control plants remained healthy, and no fungus was re-isolated. Morphological characteristics, sequence alignment and pathogenicity tests confirmed that B. linicola was the cause of P. notoginseng leaf spot disease. This is the first report of B. linicola causing leaf spot on P. notoginseng in Yunnan, China. The identification of B. linicola as the causal agent of the observed leaf spot on P. notoginseng is critical to the prevention and control of this disease in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Agricultural University, 12616, College of plant protection, 452 Fengyuan Road, Panlong District, Kunming, Yunnan, China, Kunming, China, 650201; ykweter@outlook.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Kuan", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Agricultural University, 12616, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, Yunnan, China, 650201; heyulin088@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Yulin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Agricultural University, 12616, Kunming, Yunnan, China; luolifenllf@126.com."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Lifen", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Agricultural University, 12616, Kunming, Yunnan, China; 2015728612@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yaping", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Agricultural University, 12616, Kunming, Yunnan, China; 2628655109@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Wensong", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Agricultural University, Plant protection faculty, Plant protection, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, Yunnan, China, 650201; shushengzhu79@126.com."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Shu-Sheng", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Protection College, Yunnan Agricultural University, kunming, Kunming, Yunnan, China, 650201; yppl@public.km.yn.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "You Yong", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Agricultural University, No. 452, fengyuan road, panlong district, kunming city, yunnan province, Kunming, China, 650201; g87l12w12@163.com."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Liwei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Southwest Foresttry UniversityKunming, Yunnan, China, 650224; hexiahong@hotmail.com."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Xiahong", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37172971", "10.1094/PDIS-12-22-2796-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
