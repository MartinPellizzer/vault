Phospholipase D variants were resolved by nondenaturing and isoelectric focusing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by immunoblotting using anti-phospholipase D antibodies and by enzyme activity assay. Three phospholipase D variants were produced differentially in the roots, endosperm, cotyledons, and hypocotyl of 5-day postgermination seedlings of castor bean. Furthermore, different patterns of phospholipase D variants were found in the different regions of hypocotyl (elongated and hook). Multiple phospholipase D forms were found in florets of cauliflower and broccoli, leaves of cabbage, celery, tomato, and potato, and alfalfa sprouts, suggesting that structural heterogeneity of phospholipase D occurs widely in plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Kansas State University, Manhattan, 66506, USA."}], "LastName": "Dyer", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "NlmUniqueID": "0372516", "ISSNLinking": "0006-291X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.4.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipase D"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isoelectric Focusing"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipase D"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8660338", "10.1006/bbrc.1996.0558", "S0006-291X(96)90558-6"]}}]}
