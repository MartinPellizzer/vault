Research so far has revealed that the physician Alexander of Tralles was the first who used it in the 6th century AD. Alexander recommended a plant he called \"Hermodaktylon\", which takes off the pain in the feet immediately. \"Hermodaktylon\" is identified with Colchicum autumnale L., which contains colchicine in his bulbs and seeds. We will present new data that varieties of Colchicum were used for medical treatment of Podagra far earlier than hitherto known by research.", "We performed a systematic full text search in Greek and Latin original sources of Antiquity for \"Hermodaktylon\"/\"Hermodactylus\" and for the synonyms \"Ephemeron\"/\"Ephemerum\", \"Kolchikon\"/\"Colchicum\", and \"Bolbos (agrios)\"/\"bulbus (agrestis)\". We analysed our findings with philological and historico-critical methods.", "There are 48 text passages in original sources. Lucian of Samosata (2nd century AD) was the first who mentioned a plant he called \"bolbos\" as a remedy for Podagra. The Byzantine physician Jacobus Psychrestes (5th century AD) developed two recipes. A\u00ebtius of Amida (6th century AD) transmitted two recipes. One case with an overdose of colchicine was discovered which resulted in the death of a patient in Byzantine times.", "New specific recipes containing Colchicum were discovered. Jacobus Psychrestes and A\u00ebtius used Colchicum systematically for the therapy of Podagra earlier than the 6th century AD. However, the therapeutic use of Colchicum was already known in the 2nd century AD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of the History, Philosophy and Ethics of Medicine, Ulm University, Germany. frank.ursin@uni-ulm.de."}], "LastName": "Ursin", "ForeName": "Frank", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of the History, Philosophy and Ethics of Medicine, Ulm University, Germany."}], "LastName": "Steger", "ForeName": "Florian", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Clin Exp Rheumatol", "NlmUniqueID": "8308521", "ISSNLinking": "0392-856X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gout Suppressants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Poisons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SML2Y3J35T", "NameOfSubstance": "Colchicine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Byzantium"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Colchicine"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Gout"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Gout Suppressants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physicians"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poisons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30557131", "13062"]}}]}
