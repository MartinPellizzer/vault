Concentrations of 1.25 and 2.5 mg/ml of the extract significantly reduced motility after 60 minutes of incubation (p/001). Further concentrations of 5 mg/ml caused the same significant level of impairment as 1.25 and 2.5 mg.ml concentrations (p.001), but at 30 minutes rather than 60 minutes. Moreover concentrations of 10 and 20 mg/ml significantly prevented motility almost immediately (p.001). In fact, at 20 mg/ml concentrations, motility completely stopped at 0 minutes in 3 of the 9 samples and, by 5 minutes, it stopped motility in an additional 5 samples. None of the samples exhibited mobile sperm at 15 minutes at 20 mg/ml concentrations. The extract could produce sperm antimotility activity at the EC50 concentration of 2.29 mg/ml. In addition, after washing, the researchers observed that the antimotility effect was basically irreversible. The highest concentration (20 mg/ml) impaired the functional integrity of the plasma membrane and viability of spermatozoa. This did not happen at the lower concentrations. Instead, the researchers found that a rise in intracellular calcium, and/or a fall in cAMP content, and/or enhanced generation of a reactive oxygen species may have caused the antimotility action at the lower concentrations. In conclusion, scientists can use the seeds of A. precatorius to isolate bioactive compounds with contraceptive abilities."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["071075", "00208555"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Asia", "Biology", "Calcium", "Clinical Research", "Comparative Studies", "Contraception", "Contraception Research", "Contraceptive Agents", "Contraceptive Mode Of Action", "Cytologic Effects", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Family Planning", "Health", "Health Services", "In Vitro", "Ingredients And Chemicals", "Inhibition Of Fertilization", "Inorganic Chemicals", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Metals", "Methodological Studies", "Physiology", "Research Methodology", "Southern Asia", "Sperm Immobilizing Agents", "Sperm Transport Inhibition", "Spermicidal Contraceptive Agents", "Sri Lanka", "Studies"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "1943179", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "13"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "08", "Day": "28"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0378-8741", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "33", "Issue": "1-2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1991", "Season": "May-Jun"}}, "Title": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Ethnopharmacol"}, "ArticleTitle": "Sperm antimotility properties of a seed extract of Abrus precatorius.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "85", "EndPage": "90", "MedlinePgn": "85-90"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["This study examined the inhibitory effects of a methanol extract of Abrus precatorius seeds on the motility of washed human spermatozoa. The extract caused a concentration-related impairment of percentage sperm motility; with the EC50 concentration being 2.29 mg/ml. This effect on motility was essentially irreversible. With the highest concentration tested (20.0 mg/ml), the onset of the antimotility action was almost immediate. In addition, this concentration impaired the functional integrity of the plasma membrane (hypoosmotic swelling test) and viability (nigrosin-eosin stain) of spermatozoa. In contrast, with a lower concentration (5.0 mg/ml), such effects were not evident. It is concluded that at the lower concentrations the antimotility action may result from a rise in intracellular calcium (not via influx) and/or a decline in cAMP content and/or enhanced generation of a reactive oxygen species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka."}], "LastName": "Ratnasooriya", "ForeName": "W D", "Initials": "WD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Amarasekera", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Perera", "ForeName": "N S", "Initials": "NS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Premakumara", "ForeName": "G A", "Initials": "GA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Spermatocidal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3G6A5W338E", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeine"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osmolar Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sperm Motility"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatocidal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatozoa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sri Lanka"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1943179", "10.1016/0378-8741(91)90166-b", "0378-8741(91)90166-B"]}}]}
