This study aimed to assess its clinical features and other associated allergies, and to define skin prick tests (SPT), specific IgE, and dose response by oral food challenge.", "Our study investigated 36 children with positive mustard SPT. The diagnosis of mustard allergy was based on open or single-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (SBPCFC). We compared the subjects to 22 controls.", "The initial clinical features were atopic dermatitis (51.8%), and urticaria and/or angioedema (37%). Fifteen children were allergic (positive SBPCFC) and 21 children were nonallergic (negative SBPCFC). Symptoms after mustard ingestion started under 3 years of age in 53.3% of the subjects. There was no significant difference in the food allergies and associated inhalant allergen sensitizations between the two groups. In the allergic group, the mean wheal diameter for mustard SPT was 8.8 mm and the median concentration of mustard serum (s) IgE 14.8 kU/l. The mean cumulative reactive dose were 153 mg.", "Allergic reactions to mustard started early in life. Clinical symptoms were not severe in children.
