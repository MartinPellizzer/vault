The alkaloids are carcinogenic in rats but have not been associated, so far, with tumors in humans. For the known instances of human intake of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, the main alkaloids involved and estimated consumption rates have been tabulated. These rates are compared with the dose rates of the same or similar alkaloids that lead to a significant tumor incidence in experimental rats. In the more chronic poisoning outbreaks, the intake rate is comparable with a carcinogenic dose in rats. The long-term observation of survivors of these outbreaks would offer an opportunity for determining whether pyrrolizidine alkaloids are carcinogenic in humans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Culvenor", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6620404", "10.1080/15287398309530372"]}}]}
