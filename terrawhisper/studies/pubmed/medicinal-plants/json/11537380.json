Iodinated potable water will likely be used to grow plants in space. Little is known about the effects of iodine disinfection products on plants. Seeds of select higher plants were germinated in water iodinated using the Shuttle Microbial Check Valve, and water to which measured amounts of iodide was added. Percent germination was decreased in seeds of most species germinated in iodinated water. Beans were most affected. Germination rates, determined from germination half-times, were decreased for beans germinated in iodinated water, and water to which iodide was added. Development was retarded and rootlets were conspicuously absent in bean and several other plant species germinated in iodinated water. Iodide alone did not elicit these responses. Clearly iodine disinfection products can affect higher plants. These effects must be carefully considered for plant experimentation and cultivation in space, and in design and testing of closed environmental life support systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NASA/Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035, USA."}], "LastName": "Janik", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Macler", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thorstenson", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sauer", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "MacElroy", "ForeName": "R D", "Initials": "RD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Adv Space Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9878935", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1177"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9679TC07X4", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Brassica"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Iodine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Life Support Systems"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spacecraft"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11537380", "10.1016/0273-1177(89)90035-5"]}}]}
