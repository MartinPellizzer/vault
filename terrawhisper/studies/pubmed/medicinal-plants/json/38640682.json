Therefore, it's crucial to find out how plants resist this toxic metal to develop strategies for remediating Cd-contaminated soils. In this study, we identified CIP1, a transporter protein, by screening interactors of the protein kinase CIPK23. CIP1 is located in vesicles membranes and can transport Cd<sup>2+</sup> when expressed in yeast cells. Cd stress specifically induced the accumulation of CIP1 transcripts and functional proteins, particularly in the epidermal cells of the root tip. CIKP23 could interact directly with the central loop region of CIP1, phosphorylating it, which is essential for the efficient transport of Cd<sup>2+</sup>. A loss-of-function mutation of CIP1 in wild-type plants led to increased sensitivity to Cd stress. Conversely, tobacco plants overexpressing CIP1 exhibited improved Cd tolerance and increased Cd accumulation capacity. Interestingly, this Cd accumulation was restricted to roots but not shoots, suggesting that manipulating CIP1 does not risk Cd contamination of plants' edible parts. Overall, this study characterizes a novel Cd transporter, CIP1, with potential to enhance plant tolerance to Cd toxicity while effectively eliminating environmental contamination without economic losses."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
