Four antifungal bisphosphocholines [irlbacholine (<b>2</b>) and three new analogues, gentianalines A-C (<b>1</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>)] were identified from <i>G. crassicaulis</i> by a bioassay-guided fractionation and structure elucidation approach. Subsequent chemical analysis of 56 \"Qinjiao\" samples (45 from <i>G. crassicaulis</i>, five from <i>G. macrophylla</i>, three from <i>G. dahurica</i>, and three from <i>G. straminea</i>) showed that bisphosphocholines were present in all four <i>Gentiana</i> species, with irlbacholine as the major compound ranging from 2.0 to 6.2 mg per gram of dried material. Irlbacholine exhibited potent in vitro antifungal activity against <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>, <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>, <i>Candida albicans</i>, and <i>Candida glabrata</i> with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 0.63, 1.25, 10.0, and 5.0 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Identification of the bisphosphocholines, a rare class of antifungal natural products, in these medicinal plants provides scientific evidence to complement their medicinal use. The bisphosphocholines carrying a long aliphatic chain possess amphiphilic molecule-like properties with a tendency of retention in both normal and reversed-phase silica gel column chromatography and thereby may be neglected in natural products discovery. This report may stimulate interest in this class of compounds, which warrant the further study of other biological activities as well."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
