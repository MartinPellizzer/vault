Obesity is associated with various metabolic syndromes; conventional treatments are limited and may induce serious adverse events due to polytherapy regimens. Currently, demands for complementary and alternative medicine that has a proven safety profile for the treatment of obesity with or without metabolic risk factors are increasing.Our team of preclinical experts reported a significant anti-obesity effect of the Korean herbal medicine, Galgeun-tang (GGT). Thus, we designed this trial to explore the effects of GGT among obese women to accumulate optimal clinical evidence.Obesity is not only a component of metabolic syndrome and a factor associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease but is also related to insulin resistance. Previous research has confirmed that an increasing body mass index is highly related with increased risk of metabolic syndrome among overweight and obese individuals. The effectiveness of the Korean medicine herbal formula, GGT on obesity has been previously reported. The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of GGT for weight loss among obese Korean women with or without high risk for metabolic syndrome.", "This study is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial. A total of 160 participants will be randomly distributed in 2 groups, the GGT group or the placebo group in a 1:1 ratio using a web-based randomization system. Each group will be administered GGT or placebo 3 times a day for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint is to assess the change in weight from baseline. The secondary endpoints are the following: the changes in body composition measurements, anthropomorphic measurements, obesity screening Laboratory tests, patient self-reported questionnaires, and economic evaluation outcomes. Adverse events will also be reported.", "The findings of this study will confirm methodologies regarding the efficacy and safety of GGT for weight loss among obese Korean women with or without metabolic risk factors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Korean Preventive Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Safety and Effectiveness Evaluation for Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul."}], "LastName": "Ko", "ForeName": "Youme", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oriental Medicine Research Institute, College of Korean Medicine, Gachon University, Seongnam."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyun-Ju", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Korean Rehabilitation Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Dongguk University, Seoul."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hojun", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oriental Rehabilitation Medicine, Gwangju Oriental Hospital of Dongshin University, Gwangju."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Jin-Bong", "Initials": "JB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Korean Medicine Rehabilitation, Gwangju Medical Center, College of Korean Medicine, Wonkwang University, Gwangju."}], "LastName": "Kwon", "ForeName": "Young-Dal", "Initials": "YD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Korean Rehabilitation Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul."}], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Won-Seok", "Initials": "WS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Korean Preventive Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Safety and Effectiveness Evaluation for Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul."}], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "Bo-Hyoung", "Initials": "BH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Comparative Effectiveness Research & Economic Evaluation in Korean Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "NamKwen", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4478-4030"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Korean Rehabilitation Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Gachon University, Seongnam, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Yun-Kyung", "Initials": "YK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Korean Preventive Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Safety and Effectiveness Evaluation for Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul."}], "LastName": "Ko", "ForeName": "Seong-Gyu", "Initials": "SG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Multicenter Study", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Medicine (Baltimore)", "NlmUniqueID": "2985248R", "ISSNLinking": "0025-7974"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "epidemiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Republic of Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no competing interests."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Beilby J.
