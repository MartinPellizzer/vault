For extraction of urease, one part of bean meal was mixed with 5 parts of 20% acetone containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and stirred at 20 degrees C for 5 min. Milky substances in the extract were removed by heat treatment. Urease in the clear yellow supernatant was precipitated by adjusting the pH of the solution to 5.4 with citric acid. The acid precipitated urease was neutralized by dissolving in 0.015 M phosphate buffer, pH 8.5 (final pH 6.8 to 7.0) and then lyophilized. By this procedure, the purity of the enzyme was increase 14.7 fold, the recovery of activity was 63%, and the yield was 6.75 g from 1 kg of bean seeds. The specific activity of the preparation was 411 units/mg protein (240 units/mg solid), and the free ammonia content was less than 0.01 microgram per unit. Some other proteins were present in the urease preparation as examined by gel filtration and gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the enzyme estimated by gel filtration was 480,000. However, two urease activity bands with molecular weight of 230,000 and 480,000 were observed in the polyacrylamide gel electrophoregram. From the result of determination of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), this simple purification procedure could be used for practical preparation of urease from jack bean meal for clinical analysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei, R.O.C."}], "LastName": "Sung", "ForeName": "H Y", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "W M", "Initials": "WM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chiou", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "C T", "Initials": "CT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China (Republic : 1949- )", "MedlineTA": "Proc Natl Sci Counc Repub China B", "NlmUniqueID": "8502426", "ISSNLinking": "0255-6596"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1364PS73AF", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60-24-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercaptoethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9G34HU7RV0", "NameOfSubstance": "Edetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.5.1.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Urease"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Urea Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Precipitation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Edetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Freeze Drying"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mercaptoethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Urease"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2517764"]}}]}
