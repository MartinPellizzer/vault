Previous in vitro studies have shown that it's crude ethanolic extracts and some alkaloidal phytoconstituents possesses high affinity for the serotonin transporter protein (SERT) and serotonin receptor 1a (5HT<sub>1a</sub>) which are both implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of anxiety disorders. However, there are no in vivo studies that validates the anxiolytic actions of the plant.", "This study was therefore set to determine the anxiolytic-like activity of an orally administered hydroethanolic extract of B. disticha bulbs in naive mice using the behavioural tests of anxiety.", "Na\u00efve adult male BALB/c mice were randomly placed into five treatment groups (n=6-10): vehicle control (10ml/kg 0.9% NaCl), positive control (1mg/kg diazepam) and the hydroethanolic extract of B. disticha (10, 25 and 40mg/kg p.o.). Souk test, elevared plus maze and open field tests were used to evaluate the anxiolytic-like activity of the B. disticha extract.", "Diazepam-treated mice exhibited higher number of sector visits and line crossings in the ST, rearings in the OF and head dips in the EPM than the control (p<0.05). B. disticha extract treated groups expressed higher sector visits at 10mg/kg, and, unprotected head dips at 25mg/kg in the ST, as well as, open arm time entries at 10mg/kg dose, and unprotected head dips at all doses in the EPM than the control group (p<0.05). The 25mg/kg B. disticha dose group exhibited highest anxiolytic-like activity in both the ST and OF, while the 10mg/kg was most active in the EPM.", "The extract of B. disticha exerted good anxiolytic-like activity in both the ST and OF at medium dose (25mg/kg), while the low dose (10mg/kg) showed prominent anxiolytic-like activity in the EPM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
