Water extraction of Ya-hom at concentrations of 0.83, 1.67, 8.33 and 16.67 mg/ml stimulated aortic ring contraction dose-dependently. The maximum contraction, at 16.67 mg/ml, was about 14% that of NE. This stimulatory effect of Ya-hom was inhibited partially by phentolamine, which indicated that the effect of Ya-hom was partially dependent on the alpha receptor, similar to NE. Administration of Ya-hom with NR decreased the force of aortic ring contraction as compared to the effect of NE alone, indicating that Ya-hom may have a partial alpha-agonist activity. Ya-hom at concentrations of 1.67, 8.33 and 16.67 mg/ml showed a dose-dependent, positive inotropic and negative chronotropic effects. Ya-hom increased the force of isolated atrial contraction with a slow onset and prolonged action. In contrast to norephinephrine, which acted on beta1 receptor, causing positive inotropic and chronotropic effects, propranolol did not alter the effect of Ya-hom on the atrial contraction. This shows that the action of Ya-hom on atrial contraction does not involve beta receptor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mahidol University, 447 Sri-ayuthaya Road, Bangkok 10400, Thailand. pyvsv@mahidol.ac.th"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suvitayavat", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tunlert", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thirawarapan", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kitpati", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bunyapraphatsara", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Phytomedicine", "NlmUniqueID": "9438794", "ISSNLinking": "0944-7113"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiotonic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aorta, Thoracic"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiotonic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Atria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16121516", "10.1016/j.phymed.2004.03.014", "S0944-7113(05)00110-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
