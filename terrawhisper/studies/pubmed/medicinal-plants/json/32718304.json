Herbal medicine appears to be effective in the treatment of sleep disorders which have been valued by many of publications and patents.", "The present study aimed at investigating the hypnotic activity of the hydro-alcoholic extract of Capparis spinosa (HAE) in mice.", "Three doses of HAE (30, 60 and 120 mg/kg) and three fractions of it, namely n-hexane fraction (NHF), water fraction (WF), and ethyl acetate fraction (EAF), were given in comparison with diazepam (3 mg/kg body weight i.p.) as a positive control and saline as a negative control. After 30 min, pentobarbital (30 mg/kg body weight i.p.) was administered. In addition, LD50 of HAE was examined and the cytotoxicity of HAE was assessed in l929 cells using the MTT assay. Moreover, for motorcoordination ability, 30 mins after administration of HAE, the rotarod test was performed.", "The results exhibited that the HAE and all the fractions significantly augmented pentobarbital induced sleeping time, which was comparable to that of induced by diazepam. The LD50 value was 2.4 g/kg. The extract did not induce any cytotoxic effects in L929 fibroblast cells. HAE did not affect the animals' performance on the rotarod test.", "Our finding suggests that the hydro-alcoholic extract of C. spinosa possesses a hypnotic potential that may require further scientific investigations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rakhshandeh", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rashidi", "ForeName": "Roghayeh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vahedi", "ForeName": "Mohammad Mahdi", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Social Security Organization, 17th Shahrivar Hospital, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khorrami", "ForeName": "Mohammad Bagher", "Initials": "MB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Sleep Medicine, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbassian", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Forouzanfar", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Recent Pat Food Nutr Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "101526178", "ISSNLinking": "1876-1429"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypnotics and Sedatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Capparis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Hypnotics and Sedatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32718304", "10.2174/2212798411666200727151142", "FNA-EPUB-108510"]}}]}
