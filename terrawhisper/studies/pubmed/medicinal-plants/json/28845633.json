The early bolting does not only reduce herbs production but also affect the active ingredients of plants. The concept of early bolting, physiological theory, induce factors of the quality of medicine and, control technology about the early bolting of Umbelliferae are integrative reviewed in the paper. Its occurrence mechanism include: genetic factors, environmental and ecological factors, endogenous hormones, sowing, fertilizer and other production management measures. For the above occurring mechanism, the proposed prevention measures are as follows: preferably germplasm, sowing, rational fertilization, exogenous hormones, shading, reed head cut off, cut fall the leaves, reasonable planting density and other agronomic measures can reduce its bolting rate. And the early bolting problem focused for future research are mentioned, including: development of authentic ingredients cultivation technical specifications, screened early bolting hormone inhibitor, in-depth study of the mechanism of early bolting, reveal its early bolting gene and key ecological factors. The research of vernalization gene, gene regulation of flowering early bolting will solve the problem of quality and production reducing fundamentally caused by the early bolting."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijng 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Dong-Yue", "Initials": "DY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijng 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Qing-Xiu", "Initials": "QX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijng 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Li-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijng 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijng 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Mei-Lan", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijng 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Tie-Lin", "Initials": "TL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijng 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28845633", "10.4268/cjcmm20160104"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
