In addition, botanicals play a role in disease prevention. For example, epidemiologic studies have suggested that a reduced risk of cancer is associated with high consumption of vegetables and fruits. Thus, the cancer chemopreventive potential of naturally occurring phytochemicals is of great interest. In this review, we discuss the cancer chemopreventive activity of cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and broccoli, Allium vegetables such as garlic and onion, green tea, Citrus fruits, tomatoes, berries, ginger and ginseng, as well as some medicinal plants. In addition, methods for the discovery of active compounds from plant sources are described. Several lead compounds, such as brassinin (from cruciferous vegetables like Chinese cabbage), sulforaphane (from broccoli) and its analog sulforamate, withanolides (from tomatillos), and resveratrol (from grapes and peanuts among other foods), are in preclinical or clinical trials for cancer chemoprevention. Phytochemicals of these types have great potential in the fight against human cancer, and a variety of delivery methods are available as a result of their occurrence in nature."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Program for Collaborative Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Eun Jung", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pezzuto", "ForeName": "John M", "Initials": "JM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "N01-CN-05024", "Acronym": "CN", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "N01-CN-05124", "Acronym": "CN", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "N01-CN-15017-44", "Acronym": "CN", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P01 CA48112", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Metastasis Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "8605731", "ISSNLinking": "0167-7659"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}], "NumberOfReferences": "183"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12549763", "10.1023/a:1021254725842"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
