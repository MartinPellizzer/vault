It is an important traditional Chinese medicinal plant known for its strong flavor and medicinal effects. It is rich in active ingredients and has a wide range of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune regulation properties. From May to July in 2023, a serious leaf rot outbreak occurred on A. argyi in several farms (approximately 200 acres) in Tanghe county (32\u00b046'44\" N, 112\u00b043'13\" E), Henan Province, China. The incidence rate reached 65% (n=200). Pale yellow spots (1-2 cm in diameter) first appeared on the leaves, then expanded to form irregular yellowish-brown lesions, eventually causing the entire leaves to wither. Diseased leaves (30) were collected and cut into 5 x 5 mm2 pieces in the areas between infected and healthy tissues. The excised plant tissues were sterilized in 75% ethanol and 1% sodium hypochlorite solution for 30 seconds and one minute, respectively. The tissues were then rinsed with sterile water and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) followed by incubating at 25 \u00b0C for 3 days. The isolated strains belonged to the genera Fusarium and Alternaria. After pathogenicity verification, 25 purified Fusarium strains were obtained. Three representative strains (AC-Q, AC-X, AC-Y) from different regions were used for further studies. Each strain formed abundant aerial mycelium that was initially white and later developed into purple pigments. Aerial conidiophores were sparsely branched, terminating with verticillate phialides. Macroconidia were slender, straight, and measured 21.8 to 47.5 \u00d7 3.1 to 4.4 \u03bcm, with two to four septa. Microconidia were clavate and measured 8.31 to 11.6 \u00d7 2.1 to 3.5 \u03bcm. Morphological characteristics were consistent with the species description of Fusarium verticillioides (Sacc.) Nirenberg 1976 (Leslie and Summerell, 2006). The rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS), \u03b2-tubulin gene (tub2), translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene (tef1), calmodulin (cmdA), RNA polymerase II largest subunit (rpb1) and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (rpb2) were amplified for molecular identification (O'Donnell et al., 2022). The sequences were deposited in GenBank with accession Nos. OR960548, OR960552, OR960555 (ITS), OR972413, OR972414, OR972415 (tub2), OR797685, OR797686, OR797687 (tef1), OR972410, OR972411, OR972412 (cmdA), PP035106, PP035107, PP035108 (rpb1), and PP035109, PP035110, PP035111 (rpb2). BLASTn analysis of AC-Q sequences exhibited 99 to 100% similarity with F. verticillioides sequences (strains CBS 576.78) MT010888 of cmdA, MT0109566 of rpb1, and MT010972 of rpb2. A phylogenetic tree was constructed with concatenated sequences (tub2, tef1, cmdA, rpb1, rpb2), alongside the sequences of the type strains using the neighbor-joining method. The three strains formed a clade with the type strain CBS 576.78 of F. verticillioides, and were separated from other Fusarium spp. These morphological and molecular identifications indicated that the pathogen was F. verticillioides. Pathogenicity was tested on 10 healthy 2-month-old potted seedlings by spraying them with a conidial suspension (106 conidia ml-1), and 5 seedlings were sprayed with sterilized water as a control. The plants were placed in a climate incubator at 28\u00b0C and a relative humidity of approximately 90%. Ten days after seedling inoculation, typical lesions were observed on the treated plants, except in the control group. The reisolated strains were identified as F. verticillioides by morphological and molecular characterization, fulfilling Koch's postulates. F. verticillioides is known to cause Fusarium ear rot on maize, as well as diseases on other plants in China such as Brassica rapa (Akram et al., 2020) and Schizonepeta tenuifolia (Li et al., 2024). This is the first report of F. verticillioides causing leaf rot on A. argyi worldwide. Identification of the pathogen is crucial for implementing management approaches to reduce yield losses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanyang Normal University, Nanyang, China; 42828757@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Tan", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanyang Normal University, Nanyang, China; 2874949509@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shuchang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanyang, China; 421616150@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Enping", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanyang Normal University, Nanyang, China; 1352053572@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Xinyi", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanyang Normal University, Nanyang, China; 3330726297@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Sixiang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanyang Normal University, Nanyang, China; 305108881@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Suo", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanyang Normal University, Nanyang, China; qiuhongniu723@163.com."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Qiuhong", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38932449", "10.1094/PDIS-03-24-0667-PDN"]}}]}
