The major aroma constituents of soybeans were 1-octen-3-ol (13.699 ppm), maltol (1.662 ppm), phenylethyl alcohol (1.474 ppm), hexanol (1.430 ppm), and gamma-butyrolactone (1.370 ppm). The major aroma constituents of mung beans were hexanol (3.234 ppm), benzyl alcohol (2.060 ppm), gamma-butyrolactone (1.857 ppm), 2-methyl-2-propenal (1. 633 ppm), and pentanol (1.363 ppm). The major aroma chemicals of soybeans and mung beans were examined for antioxidative activities in two different assays. Eugenol, maltol, benzyl alcohol, and 1-octen-3-ol showed potent antioxidative activities in two different assays. Eugenol, maltol, benzyl alcohol, and 1-octen-3-ol inhibited the oxidation of hexanal by 100%, 93%, 84%, and 32%, respectively, for a period of 40 days at the 500 microg/mL level. Eugenol, maltol, benzyl alcohol, and 1-octen-3-ol inhibited malonaldehyde (MA) formation from cod liver oil by 91%, 78%, 78%, and 78%, respectively, at the 160 microg/mL level. The antioxidative activity of eugenol was comparable to that of the natural antioxidant alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Toxicology, University of California at Davis, One Shields Avenue, Davis, California 95616, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "K G", "Initials": "KG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shibamoto", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10995351", "10.1021/jf000442u", "jf000442u"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
