A. MEYER, on rat liver protein phosphorylation after intraperitoneal administration of CCl4 alone or together with G-Rb1. We found that 118, 63, and 34kDa proteins were prominently phosphorylated in liver homogenates prepared from CCl4-administered rats, while these protein-phosphorylations were inhibited in the homogenate prepared from the G-Rb1 plus CCl4-administration group. When inhibitors of protein kinases were exogenously added to the homogenates from either the CCl4-administered group or the G-Rb1 plus CCl4-administered group, their phosphorylations were inhibited much more by W-7, an inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM-PK), than by H-7, an inhibitor of protein kinase C (C-kinase). Interestingly, only 34kDa was phosphorylated in homogenates prepared from the corn oil-, G-Rb1-, and G-Rb1 plus CCl4-administered groups by the exogenous addition of sodium fluoride (NaF), an inhibitor of glycogen synthase. Additionally, G-Rb1 inhibited the Ca(2+)-accumulation induced by CCl4 both in liver homogenates and microsomes. The above results imply that G-Rb1 inhibits the CCl4-induced protein phosphorylations by modulating CaM-PK rather than C-kinase, and that 34kDa protein may play a different biological role in cellular environment from 118 and 63kDa proteins. Therefore, a study in which G-Rb1 is employed as a modulator of critical CCl4-induced phenomena ranging from the disturbance of Ca2+ concentration to protein phosphorylation may be successfully applicable to investigate the diverse physiological functions of liver."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemical Pharmacology, Korea Ginseng and Tobacco Research Institute, Taejon, Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "K M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rhee", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Y B", "Initials": "YB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "K J", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfonamides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "65595-90-6", "NameOfSubstance": "W 7"}, {"RegistryNumber": "84477-87-2", "NameOfSubstance": "1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-79-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CL2T97X0V0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Kinase C"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.17", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Kinase C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfonamides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8799482", "10.1248/bpb.19.834"]}}]}
