Bioactivity guided isolation approach was used to identify active constituent for anti-adipogenesis and PL inhibition assay. Inhibition of lipid accumulation and adipogenic transcription factor was measured by oil Red 'O' staining and quantitative real-time PCR method respectively.", "Ethyl acetate extract of Oroxylum indicum bark was found to be most active in screening of anti-adipogenesis (59.12\u00b11.66% lipid accumulation as compared to control at 50\u03bcg/mL dose) and PL inhibition (89.12\u00b16.87% PL inhibition at 250\u03bcg/mL dose) assays. Further, three bioactive flavonoids were isolated and identified as oroxylin A, chrysin and baicalein from O. indicum bark. Oroxylin A, chrysin, and baicalein were inhibited lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (75.00\u00b15.76%, 70.21\u00b14.23% and 77.21\u00b15.49% lipid accumulation respectively in comparison to control at 50\u03bcM dose) and PL enzyme (69.86\u00b12.96%, 52.08\u00b12.14% and 45.06\u00b12.42% PL inhibition respectively at 250\u03bcg/mL dose). In addition, oroxylin A and chrysin also inhibited PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1, major adipogenic transcription factors, in 3T3L-1 preadipocytes during adipogenesis process at 50\u03bcM dose.", "The present study augurs the anti-obesity potential of well practiced Ayurvedic herb O. indicum and its flavonoids."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
