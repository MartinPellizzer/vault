In this study, we identified major genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of polyacetylene in B. pilosa. Seven polyacetylene metabolites present in B. pilosa leaves were induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment and physical wounding. Transcriptome analysis via high-throughput sequencing revealed 39 202 annotated gene fragment sequences. A DNA microarray established by the 39 202 annotated genes was used to profile gene expression in B. pilosa leaf and root tissues. As no polyacetylene compounds were found in roots, the gene expression pattern in root tissue was used as a negative control. By subtracting MeJA-induced genes in roots, we obtained 1216 genes in leaves showing an approximate three-fold increase in expression post-MeJA treatment. Nine genes encoding enzymes with desaturation function were selected for confirmation of expression by qRT-PCR. Among them, two genes, BPTC030748 and BPTC012564, were predicted to encode \u039412-oleate desaturase (OD) and \u039412-fatty acid acetylenase (FAA), respectively. In B. pilosa leaves, RNAi knock-down concomitantly decreased, while virus-mediated transient overexpression of either gene elevated polyacetylene content. In summary, we demonstrate that two important enzymes, \u039412-oleate desaturase and \u039412-fatty acid acetylenase, involved in desaturation of linear fatty acid precursors play a role in polyacetylene biosynthesis in an important medicinal plant, Bidens pilosa."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.
