It is important to explore the present situation of medicinal plants within special regions in order to provide scientific instructions for their sustainable protection and exploitation and utilization. In this study, we carried out the field survey according to the guideline of national survey of Chinese material medica resources and the guideline of plant species diversity survey and estimation at county level with the line transect method. With the field surveyed data, we explored the diversity and distribution of the threatened medicinal vascular plants in Lancang. We found that there were 33 species of the threatened medicinal vascular plants in this county. These species were from 23 genera and 17 families, and were composed of one critical endangered, 10 endangered and 22 vulnerable species. They were widely distributed across the whole county and were most concentrated in the town of Nuozhadu, Fazhanhe, Nuofu and Zhutang, which were located in the southeastern, southwestern and western of Lancang, respectively. We also found that the plant species richness followed a unimodal pattern along elevation. In addition, we found that the areas of Nuozhadu Nature Reserve in Lancang only covered six threatened medicinal vascular plants, while most of the regions with high species richness were not well protected. Therefore, we proposed to make more efforts to improve the protection measurements in order to better protect and utilize the medicinal plants in Lancang."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medical, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Chi", "ForeName": "Xiu-Lian", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pu'er National Institute of Ethnic Traditional Medicine, Pu'er 665000, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Yi-Kai", "Initials": "YK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Academy of Forestry, Kunming 650204, China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medical, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pu'er National Institute of Ethnic Traditional Medicine, Pu'er 665000, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Han-Yu", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biodiversity Research Center, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Zhi-Ping", "Initials": "ZP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biodiversity Research Center, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Guo", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pu'er National Institute of Ethnic Traditional Medicine, Pu'er 665000, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Kai-Cong", "Initials": "KC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medical, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medical, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lu-Qi", "Initials": "LQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodiversity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Tracheophyta"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29318833", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0182"]}}]}
