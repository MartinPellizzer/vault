Isolation of secondary metabolites from these sources and their respective biological properties, along with their lower toxicities and cost-effectiveness, make them a significant research focus for drug discovery. In recent times, there has been a considerable focus on isolating new chemical entities from natural flora to meet the immense demand for kinase modulators, and also to overcome major unmet medical challenges in relation to signal transduction pathways. The signal transduction systems are amongst the foremost pathways involved in the maintenance of life and protein kinases play an imperative part in these signaling pathways. It is important to find a kinase inhibitor, as it can be used not only to study cell biology but can also be used as a drug candidate for cancer and metabolic disorders. A number of plant extracts and their isolated secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, phenolics, terpenoids, and alkaloids have exhibited activities against various kinases. In the current review, we have presented a brief overview of some important classes of plant secondary metabolites as kinase modulators. Moreover, a number of phytocompounds with kinase inhibition potential, isolated from different plant species, are also discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Monash University Malaysia, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Petaling Jaya 47500, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (IPS), University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (UVAS), Lahore 54000, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Gill", "ForeName": "Muhammad Shoaib Ali", "Initials": "MSA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Monash University Malaysia, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Petaling Jaya 47500, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (IPS), University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (UVAS), Lahore 54000, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Saleem", "ForeName": "Hammad", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Monash University Malaysia, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Petaling Jaya 47500, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tropical Medicine and Biology Platform, Monash University Malaysia, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Petaling Jaya 47500, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Global Asia in 21st Century Platform, Monash University Malaysia, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Petaling Jaya 47500, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Ahemad", "ForeName": "Nafees", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Kinase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Kinase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32091334", "10.2174/1568026620666200224100219", "CTMC-EPUB-104748"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
