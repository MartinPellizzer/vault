The investigation exposed that the extracts of Justicia adathoda have potent metabolic to eradicate the human diseases. The antibacterial, tumorolytic and anti-inflammatory activity of ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts of Justicia adathoda (leaves) were assessed. In vitro anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by standard procedures. Justicia adathoda metabolic exhibit anticancer activity in human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) (in vitro) analysis. Flavonoids, saponins, alkaloids, amino acids, tannins and terpenoids were present in both the extracts. The active components present in the extracts were found to be amino acids, alkaloids, lipids and triterpenoids which have antibacterial activity shows inhibition against Salmonella and Escherichia coli. Justicia adathoda possesses significant anti-inflammatory activity and it was confirmed by in-vitro analysis. The anticancer activity was found effective in human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) (in-vitro) analysis. From the investigation could conclude that the metabolic compounds Justicia adathoda is effective against Anti-inflammation and ethyl acetate extract of Justicia adathoda are effective for Cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Deparment of Microbiology, Nehru Arts and Science College, Coimbatore, India."}], "LastName": "Sudevan", "ForeName": "Susmitha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Deparment of Microbiology, Nehru Arts and Science College, Coimbatore, India."}], "LastName": "Parasivam", "ForeName": "Ranganayaki", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Deparment of Microbiology, Nehru Arts and Science College, Coimbatore, India."}], "LastName": "Sundar", "ForeName": "Shalini", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Deparment of Microbiology, Nehru Arts and Science College, Coimbatore, India."}], "LastName": "Velauthan", "ForeName": "Heema", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Biosciences, Nehru Arts and Science College, Coimbatore, India."}], "LastName": "Ramasamy", "ForeName": "Vijayaraghavan", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.35", "NameOfSubstance": "Hyaluronoglucosaminidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Hyaluronoglucosaminidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Justicia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31608874"]}}]}
