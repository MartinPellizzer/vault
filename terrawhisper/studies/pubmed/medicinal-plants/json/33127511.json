However, its role in tissue fibrosis remains unknown. Herein, a downregulation of EI24 levels in the lungs from mouse pulmonary fibrosis (PF) model and lung epithelial cells was observed in response to bleomycin (BLM) or transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21). Then, the role of EI24 in PF was investigated through the upregulation of EI24 in vitro and in vivo. EI24 inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and extracellular matrix (ECM) production in EI24-overexpressing cells after stimulation with BLM or TGF-\u03b21. The overexpression of EI24 at 14\u00a0days after the establishment of the PF model through tail vein injection delayed the progression of PF. Moreover, the administration of EI24-overexpressing plasmid promoted the autophagy level in the lungs of the PF mouse model. In addition, the inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine limited the role of EI24 in these processes. Thus, the current data indicated that EI24 attenuates PF through inhibition of EMT process and ECM production by promoting autophagy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
