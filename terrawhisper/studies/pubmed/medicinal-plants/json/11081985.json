Medication was taken three times daily for a minimum of 3 days and a maximum of 8 days for the pilot study, and for exactly three days in the phase III study. The primary outcome measures in the patients self-evaluation were: related to pain in the muscle, cough, throat symptoms, headache, nasal symptoms and eye symptoms and temperature. The physician's fixed score diagnosis was based mainly on sign/symptoms: ears, nose, oral cavity, lymph glands-tonsils and eyes. The total symptom score showed a tendency toward improvement in the pilot study (p = 0,08), while both the total symptom score and total diagnosis score showed highly significant improvement (p < or = 0.0006 resp. 0.003) in the verum group as compared with the placebo. In both studies throat symptoms/signs, were found to show the most significant improvement."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Halleh\u00e4lsan, Clinic, Ulricehamn, Sweden. jan.melchior@swipnet.se"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Melchior", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Spasov", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ostrovskij", "ForeName": "O V", "Initials": "OV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bulanov", "ForeName": "A E", "Initials": "AE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wikman", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Clinical Trial, Phase III", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Phytomedicine", "NlmUniqueID": "9438794", "ISSNLinking": "0944-7113"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "82209-76-5", "NameOfSubstance": "andrographoside"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11081985", "10.1016/S0944-7113(00)80053-7", "S0944-7113(00)80053-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
