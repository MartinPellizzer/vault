The results of the study revealed that good quality and high yield area were mainly distributed in the original production areas in Sichuan province and where could carry out monitoring and commercialization cultivation. This method is expected to overcome shortage of traditional regionalization methods difficult to distinguish the contribution of ecological factors and quality factors, which provide an innovative theory and methodology for regionalization, and is helpful to practical application of wild resource protection, nature research, monitoring, and commercialization cultivation for Chinese material medica."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicaine Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Hong-Bing", "Initials": "HB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicaine Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Shun-Yuan", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicaine Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Lan", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicaine Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicaine Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Wen-Tao", "Initials": "WT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crop Production"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecology"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29098815", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170614.009"]}}]}
