However, their nature and source are not fully understood, making this technique difficult to use as a direct measure of the loss of xylem hydraulic conductance. Acoustic emissions were recorded during severe dehydration in lavender plants (Lavandula angustifolia) and compared with the dynamics of embolism development and cell damage. The timing and characteristics of acoustic signals from two independent recording systems were compared by principal component analysis (PCA). Changes in water potential, branch diameter, loss of hydraulic conductance, and cellular damage were also measured to quantify drought-induced damages. Two distinct phases of acoustic emissions were observed during dehydration: the first one associated with a rapid loss of diameter and a significant increase in loss of xylem conductance (90%), and the second with slower changes in diameter and a significant increase in cellular damage. Based on PCA, a developed algorithm discriminated hydraulic-related acoustic signals from other sources, proposing a reconstruction of hydraulic vulnerability curves. Cellular damage preceded by hydraulic failure seems to lead to a lack of recovery. The second acoustic phase would allow detection of plant mortality."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.
