Thus, the search for potentially efficacious compounds from medicinal plants that can be used in the treatment of PD has gained significant interest.", "In many medicinal plants, selenium is primarily found in an organic form. We investigated the neuroprotective potential of an organic form of selenium, N-\u03b3-(L-glutamyl)-L-selenomethionine (Glu-SeMet) in a Caenorhabditis elegans PD model and its possible molecular mechanisms.", "We used a C. elegans pharmacological PD strain (BZ555) that specifically expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) in dopaminergic neurons and a transgenic PD strain (NL5901) that expresses human \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) in muscle cells to investigate the neuroprotective potential of\u00a0Glu-SeMet against PD.", "We found that Glu-SeMet significantly ameliorated 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced dopaminergic neuron damage in the transgenic BZ555 strain, with corresponding improvements in slowing behavior and intracellular ROS levels. In addition, compared with clinical PD drugs (L-DOPA and selegiline), Glu-SeMet demonstrated stronger ameliorated effects on 6-OHDA-induced toxicity. Glu-SeMet also triggered the nuclear translocation of SKN-1/Nrf2 and significantly increased SKN-1, GST-4, and GCS-1 mRNA levels in the BZ555 strain. However, Glu-SeMet did not increase mRNA levels or ameliorate the damage to dopaminergic neurons when the BZ555 strain was subjected to skn-1 RNA interference (RNAi). Glu-SeMet also upregulated the mRNA levels of the selenoprotein TRXR-1 in both the BZ555 and BZ555; skn-1 RNAi strains and significantly decreased \u03b1-syn accumulation in the NL5901 strain, although this was not observed in the NL5901; trxr-1 strain.", "We found that Glu-SeMet has a neuroprotective effect against PD in a C. elegans PD model and that the anti-PD effects of Glu-SeMet were associated with SKN-1/Nrf2 and TRXR-1. Glu-SeMet may thus have the potential for use in therapeutic applications or supplements to slow the progression of PD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
