The present study aimed to investigate the anti-bacterial and Immunostimulant activity of three selected Indian medicinal plants, Allium sativum, Adhatoda vasica and Centella asiatica for treating Bacillus licheniformis PKBMS<sub>16</sub> by subsequent experimental and clinical trials using different organic polar and non-polar solvents. The antimicrobial and Immunostimulant activity of methanolic crude extracts of Adhatoda vasica was fractions and active constituents was further characterized by chromatography and mass spectroscopy studies using FTIR, <sup>1</sup>HNMR and <sup>13c</sup> NMR to identify as well as to determine the nature of the pure compound which is phytol (C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>40</sub>O), a diterpene alcohol with a molecular weight of m/z 297. In order to study the in vivo anti-pathogenic influence of the biologically active compounds, phytol were incorporated to the artificial diets at the concentration of 2, 5 and 8\u00a0mg/kg and fed to the1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>5</sup>\u00a0CFU/ml of Bacillus licheniformis PKBMS<sub>16</sub> injected experimentally challenged ornamental goldfish Carassius auratus for twenty days. Phytol treated group significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01 and P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) reduced the rate of fish mortality. After the termination of survivability assay the estimation of hemato-biochemical parameters have been performed and revealed the significant recovery of health condition on 20th days post treatment. Therefore, the present study concluded that the low toxicity along with high bioactivity and tolerance by lower vertebrate supports the potential of phytol as a new compound for inducing fish immunity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
