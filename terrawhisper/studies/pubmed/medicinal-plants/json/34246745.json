There are many kinds of plants in this family; these are distributed practically globally and have high ornamental and medicinal values. Gastrodia elata Blume, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, is a rootless and leafless achlorophyllous orchid. Phenolic compounds are considered to be the major bioactive constituents in G. elata, with antioxidant, antiangiogenic, neuroprotective, antidepressant, anxiolytic, and sedative activities. In this study, we determined the contents of six main phenolic components in tubers, stems and flowers from G. elata. Meanwhile, the transcriptomes of the tuber, stem and flower tissues of G. elata were obtained using the BGISEQ-500 platform. A total of 58.29 Gb of data and 113,067 unigenes were obtained, of which 74,820 unigenes were functionally annotated against seven public databases. Differentially expressed genes between tuber, stem and flower tissues were identified. A total of 76 DEGs encoding eight key enzymes were identified as candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of phenolics in G. elata. For further validation, the expression levels of unigenes were measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Our results greatly enrich the transcriptomic data of G. elata and provide valuable information for the identification of candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
