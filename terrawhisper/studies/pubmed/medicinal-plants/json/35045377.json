Hence, adipose tissue really plays a pivotal role in regulating metabolism, inflammation, energy homeostasis, and thermogenesis. Disruption of hub bioactive molecules secretion such as adipokines leads to dysregulate metabolic communication between adipose tissue and other organs in non-communicable disorders. Moreover, a sedentary lifestyle may be a risk factor for adipose tissue function. Physical inactivity leads to fat tissue accumulation and promotes obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, fatty liver, osteoporosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. On the other hand, physical activity may ameliorate and protect the body against metabolic disorders, triggering thermogenesis, metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, \u03b2-oxidation, and glucose uptake. Furthermore, physical activity provides an inter-organ association and cross-talk between different tissues by improving adipose tissue function, reprogramming gene expression, modulating molecules and bioactive factors. Also, physical activity decreases chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and improves metabolic features in adipose tissue. The current review focuses on the beneficial effect of physical activity on the cardiovascular, locomotor, digestive, and nervous systems. In addition, we visualize protein-protein interactions networks between hub proteins involved in dysregulating metabolic induced by adipose tissue."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier GmbH.
