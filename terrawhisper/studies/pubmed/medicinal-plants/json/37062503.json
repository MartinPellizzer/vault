It also participates in synaptogenesis, synaptic function, axonal growth, dendrite outgrowth, and microtubule stability. Cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism are in balance in the brain. Its metabolism in the brain is mediated mainly by CYP46A1 or cholesterol 24-hydroxylase. It is responsible for eliminating about 80% of the cholesterol excess from the human brain. CYP46A1 converts cholesterol to 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24HC) that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and reaches the liver for the final elimination process. Studies show that cholesterol and 24HC levels change during neurological diseases and conditions. So, it was hypothesized that inhibition or activation of CYP46A1 would be an effective therapeutic strategy. Accordingly, preclinical studies, using genetic and pharmacological interventions, assessed the role of CYP46A1 in main neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinocerebellar ataxias, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In addition, its role in seizures and brain injury was evaluated. The recent development of soticlestat, as a selective and potent CYP46A1 inhibitor, with significant anti-seizure effects in preclinical and clinical studies, suggests the importance of this target for future drug developments. Previous studies have shown that both activation and inhibition of CYP46A1 are of therapeutic value. This article, using recent studies, highlights the role of CYP46A1 in various brain diseases and insults."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
