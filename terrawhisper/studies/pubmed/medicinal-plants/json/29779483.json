The present study aims to collect nearly all available information about chemical constituents of Flax, as well as pharmacological properties and confirmed clinical usages of it.", "We searched through databases such as Scopus and PubMed for relevant literature using the keywords: Linum usitatissimum, pharmacology and phytochemical from the beginning to 13 Aug 2017. Nearly 60 relevant papers, relating to a pharmacological and phytochemical constituent of L. usitatissimum were selected.", "According to our researches, various properties were attributed to L. usitatisimum including antioxidant, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiprotozoal, insecticidal, analgesic, anti-hyperlipidemia, anti-hyperglycemic, anti-tumor, wound healing and Feticidal activities. There were also many reports on disease prevention and healing properties of the flax. Diseases like: GI disorders, cardiovascular, urogenital, respiratory diseases and some neurological syndromes were mentioned to be treated by Flax. The application of Flax in drug formulations was also investigated.", "Despite so much animal studies that have been accomplished, there have not been enough clinical trials done on pharmacological properties of L. usitatissimum. Therefore, this study could be considered as a concise and up to date overview for further facile studies and clinical trials over the valuable plant, L. usitatissimum."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytopharmaceuticals (Traditional Pharmacy), School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ansari", "ForeName": "Ramin", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytopharmaceuticals (Traditional Pharmacy), School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Processing Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zarshenas", "ForeName": "Mohammad M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytopharmaceuticals (Traditional Pharmacy), School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Dadbakhsh", "ForeName": "Amir H", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Discov Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "101157212", "ISSNLinking": "1570-1638"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29779483", "10.2174/1570163815666180521101136", "CDDT-EPUB-90563"]}}]}
