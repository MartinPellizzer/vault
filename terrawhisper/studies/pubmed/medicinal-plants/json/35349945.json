Compounds containing scutellarein as the parent nucleus (6a-l) had good inhibitory activity against acetyl cholinesterase (AChE), with compound 6\u00a0h exhibiting the most potent inhibition of electric eel AChE and human AChE enzymes with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 6.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.66 and 7.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.49\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. In addition, compound 6\u00a0h displayed not only excellent inhibition of self- and Cu<sup>2+</sup>-induced A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> aggregation (89.17% and 86.19% inhibition) but also induced disassembly of self- and Cu<sup>2+</sup>-induced A\u03b2 fibrils (84.25% and 78.73% disaggregation). Moreover, a neuroprotective assay demonstrated that pre-treatment of PC12 cells with 6\u00a0h significantly decreased lactate dehydrogenase levels, increased cell viability, enhanced expression of relevant apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3) and inhibited RSL3 induced PC12 cell ferroptosis. Furthermore, hCMEC/D3 and hPepT1-MDCK cell line permeability assays indicated that 6\u00a0h would have optimal blood-brain barrier and intestinal absorption characteristics. The in vivo experimental data suggested that 6\u00a0h ameliorated learning and memory impairment in mice by decreasing AChE activity, increasing ACh levels and alleviating pathological damage of hippocampal tissue cells. These multifunctional properties highlight compound 6\u00a0h as a promising candidate for development as a multifunctional drug against AD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
