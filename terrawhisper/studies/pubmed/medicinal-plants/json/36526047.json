The mean size of the FA-ERL-HSA NPs prepared using a desolvation method was 135\u00a0nm. In vitro MTT assays demonstrated that FA-ERL-HSA NPs had an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 52.18\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and 17.53\u00a0\u03bcg/mL compared to free ERL which had an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 119.8\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and 103.2\u00a0\u03bcg/mL for U87MG and C6 cells for 72\u00a0h, respectively. Flow cytometry results showed the apoptosis rate with FA-ERL-HSA NPs (100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, 72\u00a0h) was higher compared to free ERL for both U87MG and C6 cells. Experiments using a rat glioblastoma model via TUNEL assay indicated that the apoptosis index of FA-ERL-HSA NPs was 48\u00a0% compared to 21\u00a0% for free ERL and the tumor size effectively decreased after a daily injection of 220\u00a0\u03bcg (2.5\u00a0mg/kg) from 87.45\u00a0mm<sup>3</sup> (19th day) to 1.28\u00a0mm<sup>3</sup> (60th day). The median survival rate of the rats increased after treatment to >100\u00a0days which was greater than controls."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
