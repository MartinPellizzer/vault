The plant extracts were applied at five dose rates, which 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3% (w/v). Adults of S. oryzae was exposed to the treated wheat at 25 degrees C and 65% RH and mortality was assessed after 24 h, 48 h, 7 day, 14 day and 21 day of exposure. Then all adults were removed and the treated substrate remained at the same conditions for an additional 45 day after this interval, the commodity was checked for progeny production. In use two extracts the mortality of adults increased with the increase of dose and exposure interval so that; mortality was 100% after 21 days of exposure at the highest dose rate. Results indicated that applied of V. cheiranthifolium extract was more effective than V. speciosum against adult insects. Interestingly, in two cases complete suppression (100% reduction) of the progeny production (F1) was observed in the treated wheat than in control even in the lowest dose rate. Therefore, our results indicate that these medicinal plants can be used for protection of stored grain from infestations of stored-product insect pests."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khoshnoud", "ForeName": "Hojat", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghiyasi", "ForeName": "Mahdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amirnia", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fard", "ForeName": "Shiva Sadig", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tajbakhsh", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Salehzadeh", "ForeName": "Hojat", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alahyary", "ForeName": "Parisa", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101247723", "ISSNLinking": "1028-8880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Coleoptera"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Verbascum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18817273", "10.3923/pjbs.2008.1380.1384"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
