In line with our previous studies about screening antibacterial natural products, five terpenoid derivatives were purified from <i>Ferula haussknechtii</i>. The separation and purification were performed by column chromatography. Their structures were determined by 1\u2009D and 2\u2009D NMR as hawraman 8-<i>p</i>-hydroxybenzoyl-tovarol (<b>1</b>), ferutinin (<b>2</b>), lancerotriol 6-(<i>p</i>-hydroxybenzoate) (<b>3</b>), chimganin (<b>4</b>), and chimgin (<b>5</b>). Then, the antibacterial effects of the purified compounds were evaluated by measuring their MIC values against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The results showed that compound (<b>1</b>) had the most antibacterial effect on <i>Bacillus cereus</i> (MIC = 16\u2009\u00b5g/mL). The antibacterial effects of <i>F. haussknechtii</i> compounds are in line with their local application and it is suggested that further studies should be conducted to determine their mechanism of action."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Arjmand", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Biology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Hamburger", "ForeName": "Matthias", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Dastan", "ForeName": "Dara", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferula"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Negative Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Positive Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35895028", "10.1080/14786419.2022.2103558"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
