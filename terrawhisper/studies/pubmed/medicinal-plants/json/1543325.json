Rapid absorption of retinal hemorrhages was observed in both treated groups: diabetic and hypertensive (mean durations, 16 days and 17.83 days, respectively). In three eyes, the hemorrhage cleared completely; partial clearance was observed in the rest of the eyes. Recurrence of a hemorrhagic episode was less in treated eyes (25% in each group) compared with control eyes (60% in diabetic and 50% in hypertensive patients). This study suggests that Saptamrita Lauha may hasten the process of retinal hemorrhage absorption and prevent its recurrence. The beneficial effect could be attributed to the flavanoid-like properties of one of the ingredients of this natural product."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Reader Department of Shalya Shalakya, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "K R", "Initials": "KR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bhatia", "ForeName": "R P", "Initials": "RP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Ophthalmol", "NlmUniqueID": "0210137", "ISSNLinking": "0003-4886"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Retinopathy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fundus Oculi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Intraocular Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Recurrence"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Retinal Hemorrhage"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1543325"]}}]}
