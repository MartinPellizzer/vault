The root of D.genkwa was studied simultaneously. The results indicated that the crude drug and processed pieces of Genkwa Ramulus were mainly composed of stems and branches where obvious opposite petiole scars and branch marks were able to be seen on their nodes. Otherwise, foliage or peduncles generally couldn't be found. Moreover, the fine silver flocculent fibers could be observed in the bark of fracture surface. The adulterants were the plant segments which were composed of stems, foliage and peduncles with spikelet-pedicel scars. There existed microstructures differences between Genkwa Ramulus and its adulterants. In the former, single thick lignified phloem fibers were interspersed in the stem phloem of the transverse section with very thick wall and unicellular non-glandular hairs could be observed on the lower epidermis of foliage. Nevertheless, in the latter, there was no thick lignified phloem fibers in cross section of stem phloem, the outer wall of epidermal cells of foliage hadthick cuticles and no non-glandular hairs in lower epidermis of foliage. The results can be used for the identification and the quality standard of the crude drug and processed pieces of D.genkwa.The characteristics of the microstructures and the transverse section can be used to identify the radix D.genkwa."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resources Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Jun-Na", "Initials": "JN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resources Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Xiao-Guang", "Initials": "XG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhi-Jie", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Rao-Rao", "Initials": "RR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Xue-Feng", "Initials": "XF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Jin-Min", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Daphne"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Wikstroemia"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29493144", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20171030.012"]}}]}
