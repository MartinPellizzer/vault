When the capacity of liposomes as nanocarriers is combined with the revolutionary potential of RNA therapies in affecting undruggable targets, the outcome would be promising drug candidates as game-changers in the cancer treatment arena. However, optimizing liposome composition, physicochemical properties, and surface chemistry is paramount to maximizing their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic attributes. This review highlighted the potential of liposomes as nanovehicles for RNA therapeutics through a literature review and looked at the most recent preclinical and clinical advancements in utilizing liposomal RNA therapeutics for cancer management. Notably, the discovery of novel targets, advancements in liposome engineering, and organizing well-planned clinical trials would help uncover the incredible potential of these nanotherapeutics in cancer patients."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
