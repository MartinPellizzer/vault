In this study, we present the HSHR (homemade single species herbal remedy reports), their methods of preparation and application, and the livestock ailments for which these remedies were used.", "The collect data from the five different high-altitude valleys of the Kyrgyz Republic on common HSHR used for the treatment of the livestock ailments and describe their preparation procedure, administration, and target animal species.", "The plant species mentioned for ethnoveterinary use were collected from five different high-altitude valleys (pastures) in the Kyrgyz Republic during 2016 and 2018. Data were gathered with the help of dialog partners (experienced local shepherds, farmers and veterinarians) through semi-structured interviews. In total, 166 dialog partners were interviewed. The special characteristics of HSHR mentioned for ethnoveterinary use and practices were documented. Plant samples and voucher specimens were collected for taxonomic identification, and preserved for future reference.", "A total of 2388 HSHR referred to 66 plant species mentioned for ethnoveterinary use belonging to 27 families and 49 genera.
