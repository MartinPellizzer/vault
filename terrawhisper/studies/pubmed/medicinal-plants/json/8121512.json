An additional 42% reported use of alternative treatments in the past, but had ceased to take them. The currently most frequently used treatment was homeopathy followed by vitamin treatments, paranormal treatments and phytotherapy. The treatments most used in the past were paranormal treatments, homeopathic remedies and enzyme therapy.
