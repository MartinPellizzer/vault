Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major component of green tea polyphenols, reportedly increases elastin synthesis in\u00a0vitro and may possess anti-inflammatory effects. We used a rat model to investigate whether EGCG could prevent AAA progression.", "AAA was induced with administration of intraluminal elastase and extraluminal CaCl<sub>2</sub> in male rats. Rats were randomly divided into a control group (n\u00a0= 30) and an EGCG group (n\u00a0= 30). In the EGCG group, an EGCG solution (20\u00a0mg/d) was administered orally to each rat from 2\u00a0weeks before AAA induction and continued 4\u00a0weeks beyond induction.", "The abdominal aortic diameter was significantly smaller in the EGCG group than in the control group on day 28 (2.9\u00a0\u00b1 0.2 vs 2.3\u00a0\u00b1 0.1\u00a0mm; P\u00a0< .0001). The medial layer wall thickness and elastin content were significantly greater in the EGCG group than in the control group on day 28 (68.4\u00a0\u00b1 13.6 vs 46.7\u00a0\u00b1 13.4\u00a0\u03bcm [P\u00a0< .001] and 20.3\u00a0\u00b1 4.6 vs 9.5\u00a0\u00b1 3.6% [P\u00a0< .0001], respectively). Gene expression levels of tropoelastin and lysyl oxidase were significantly higher in the EGCG group immediately before AAA induction, indicating promoted elastoregeneration by EGCG administration (tropoelastin: 0.59\u00a0\u00b1 0.36 control vs 1.24\u00a0\u00b1 0.36 EGCG [P\u00a0< .05], lysyl oxidase: 0.77\u00a0\u00b1 0.45 control vs 1.34\u00a0\u00b1 0.4 EGCG [P\u00a0< .05]) (fold increase). Gene expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2, were significantly downregulated in the EGCG group (1.82\u00a0\u00b1 0.71 vs 0.97\u00a0\u00b1 0.59 [P\u00a0< .05] and 3.91\u00a0\u00b1 3.24 vs 0.89\u00a0\u00b1 0.59 [P\u00a0< .05], respectively). On day 7, gene expression levels and gelatinolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinase 9 were significantly lower in the EGCG group (1.41\u00a0\u00b1 0.86 vs 0.51\u00a0\u00b1 0.42 [P\u00a0< .05] and 1.00\u00a0\u00b1 0.17 vs 0.29\u00a0\u00b1 0.12 [P\u00a0< .0001], respectively), whereas gene expression levels of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 were significantly higher in the EGCG group (0.96\u00a0\u00b1 0.11 vs 1.14\u00a0\u00b1 0.09; P\u00a0< .05).", "EGCG attenuated AAA progression in a rat model by preserving the aortic thickness and elastin content of the medial layer through regeneration of elastin, as mediated by anti-inflammatory effects, and subsequent reduction of matrix metalloproteinase activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Society for Vascular Surgery.
