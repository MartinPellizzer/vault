With the advancement of approaches and technologies, new layers of gene regulation have been identified, which play essential roles in fine-tuning biological processes. In this area, recently, small peptides emerged as key regulators in gene regulation to control developmental and physiological processes in plants. Various small peptides have also been identified and characterized to elucidate their roles. A class of small peptides, microProteins (miPs), have been shown to contain at least a protein-protein interaction domain with the potential to regulate multi-domain proteins by becoming a part of protein complexes. Recent studies suggest that some pri-miRNAs encode peptides (miPEPs), which are essential components in plant growth and development. This review provides updates about these small peptides, in general, summarizing their potential role in gene regulation and possible mechanism(s) in plants. We also propose that in-depth research on newly identified plant peptides in crops help to provide solutions enabling sustainable agriculture and food production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
