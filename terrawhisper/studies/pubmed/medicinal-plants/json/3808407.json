Such acquisition doesn't seem to be known enough by practitioners and by common people. Besides active substances such as Glycyrrhizin , Liquorice contains even steroids similar to the adrenocortical ones; among these the most important is Beta-Glycyrrhetinic acid. This one, in vivo and in vitro, produces salt and water retention by means of a \"DOCA-like\" mineral-corticoid mechanism, and clear suppression of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone axis. A low plasmatic level of Renin and Aldosterone is a common feature. The clinical picture in many ways is similar to the primary Aldosteronism and for this reason the above mentioned syndrome is usually called \"Pseudoaldosteronism\". Symptoms and signs can be classified into the following main groups: symptoms linked with water and salt retention: oedemas, hypertension, cardiac involvement. Symptoms linked with serum Potassium depletion: asthenia, paralysis (due to Potassium deficiency), myopathy with myoglobinuria. The diagnosis is essential based on an accurate pharmacological dietetic history, aimed to recognise an excessive use of Liquorice (pure or more often as substitute) in the screening of hypertension with or without hypopotassemia. Finally, the more or less quick normalisation of blood pressure and biochemical signs--as an \"ex juvantibus\" criterion--is the most important reason for the diagnosis. After a wide survey of the literature, the clinical and biological picture in four patients with chronic Liquorice ingestion and Pseudoaldosteronism syndrome is described."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Colloredo", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bertone", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Peci", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Locatelli", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brembilla", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Angeli", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Pseudoaldosteronismo da liquirizia.
