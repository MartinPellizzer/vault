Production of wine via fermenting OMWW may be a promising alternative to deal with OMWW. However, whether or not olive wine from OMWW still reserves its original bioactivities remains unclear. Objective This study examines antioxidant activity of olive wine fermented from OMWW. Materials and methods Hydroxytyrosol in olive oil was determined by HPLC. Total flavonoid, total polyphenol and in vitro antioxidant activities were measured by spectrophotometry. Aged mice were intragastricly administered 7, 14 and 28\u2009mL/kg olive wine consecutively for 30 d. Afterward, levels of malonaldehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl, reduced glutathione (GSH) and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were assayed in mouse plasma and liver. Results Contents of hydroxytyrosol, total flavonoid and total polyphenol in olive wine were 0.14\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01, 0.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06 and 0.43\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03\u2009mg/mL, respectively. The IC50 value of olive wine to scavenge DPPH and hydroxyl free radicals was 2.5% and 3.2% (v/v), respectively. Compared with the solvent control group, olive wine with a dose of 28\u2009mL/kg remarkably lowered mouse MDA concentration in liver, and reduced protein carbonyl level in plasma (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Meanwhile, olive wine at doses of 7 and 28\u2009mL/kg notably enhanced SOD activity in both mouse plasma and liver (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The beneficial effect on liver was superior to that of \u03b3-tocopherol. Conclusion The study demonstrated that olive wine from OMWW has potential for treating oxidative stress-associated diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier":
