Currently, anticoagulant drugs are primarily multitarget heparin drugs, single-target FXa inhibitors and FIIa inhibitors. In addition, some traditional Chinese drugs also have anticoagulant effects, but they are not the main direction of treatment at present. But the anticoagulant drugs mentioned above, all have a common side effect is bleeding. Many other anticoagulation targets are under investigation. With further exploration of coagulation mechanism, how to further determine new anticoagulant targets and how to make traditional Chinese medicine play anticoagulant role have become a new field of exploration.", "The purpose of the study was to summarize the recent research progress on coagulation mechanisms, new anticoagulant targets and traditional Chinese medicine.", "A comprehensive literature search was conducted using four electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang database and ClinicalTrials.gov, from the inception of the study to 28 Feb 2023. Key words used in the literature search were \"anticoagulation\", \"anticoagulant targets\", \"new targets\", \"coagulation mechanisms\", \"potential anticoagulant\", \"herb medicine\", \"botanical medicine\", \"Chinese medicine\", \"traditional Chinese medicine\", \"blood coagulation factor\", keywords are linked with AND/OR. Recent findings on coagulation mechanisms, potential anticoagulant targets and traditional Chinese medicine were studied.", "The active components extracted from the Chinese medicinal herbs, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Chuanxiong rhizoma, safflower and Panax notoginseng have obvious anticoagulant effects and can be used as potential anticoagulant drugs, but the risk of bleeding is unclear. TF/FVIIa, FVIII, FIX, FXI, FXII, and FXIII have all been evaluated as targets in animal studies or clinical trials. FIX and FXI are the most studied anticoagulant targets, but FXI inhibitors have shown stronger advantages.", "This review of potential anticoagulants provides a comprehensive resource. Literature analysis suggests that FXI inhibitors can be used as potential anticoagulant candidates. In addition, we should not ignore the anticoagulant effect of traditional Chinese medicine, and look forward to more research and the emergence of new drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier GmbH.
