This article examines the history of medicinal plant research through a case study of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) over the past 100 years. Papers published by members of the School and documents in the School archives show a fluctuating but continuous interest in plants as sources of medicine. Research interests of individual scientists, changes in the School structure and the changing role of research affected research into medicinal plants at LSHTM. As important were external developments, including the supply of plant resources, especially during wartime, the development of drug-resistance, advances in science and technology, knowledge exchange between both disciplines and cultures, the increased influence of global organizations on policy, as well as pressure groups particularly those involved in conservation. With the revival of interest in plants and the increasing variety of influences on research, it is important to have a better understanding of how debates and subsequent policy impact at the research level, and how research in turn impacts upon policy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for History in Public Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London WC1E 7HT, UK. suzanne.taylor@lshtm.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taylor", "ForeName": "Suzanne", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Berridge", "ForeName": "Virginia", "Initials": "V"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Wellcome Trust", "Country": "United Kingdom"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg", "NlmUniqueID": "7506129", "ISSNLinking": "0035-9203"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Artemisinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Malaria Vaccines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9RMU91N5K2", "NameOfSubstance": "artemisinin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia annua"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "London"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Malaria"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Malaria Vaccines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Schools, Public Health"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Tropical Medicine"}], "NumberOfReferences": "57"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16546230", "10.1016/j.trstmh.2005.11.017", "S0035-9203(06)00036-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
