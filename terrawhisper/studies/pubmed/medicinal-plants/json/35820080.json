Among other reasons, the use of herbal medicine (HM) might contribute to delay in diagnosis and treatment. This study aims to understand the utilization of HM and the reasons for its' use.", "A semistructured 30-item questionnaire with closed- and open-ended questions was applied to a cohort of patients with cancer at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre. Content analysis was performed for answers to open-ended questions.", "Three hundred two patients were interviewed, 50.9% males and 49.1% females. The mean age was 64 years. 71.6% were in stages III/IV. 70.5% patients used HM and 67.1% started conventional medicine after stopping HM, 7.5% started HM after conventional medicine, and 24.9% combined both. Stage IV patients used HM as first line significantly more often in comparison: stage I 55.6%; II 58.1%; III 57.2%; and IV 70.6%. 77.5% did not tell their doctors about the use of HM. Commonest reasons to use HM were belief in cure, hope of symptom relief, lack of cancer services, and tradition.", "The majority of patients used HM before consulting a doctor, which contributes to stage IV presentation. Use of HM alongside with chemotherapy is mostly not known to the treating physician and may lead to interactions. These findings must alert health care workers and health policymakers to further foster health education about cancer and its treatment. Further research is needed to understand the wide use of HM among Tanzanian patients with cancer and the role that traditional and spiritual healers play in the field of cancer care."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9838-9805"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Care Centre, Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre, Moshi, Tanzania."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section Global Health, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}], "LastName": "Henke", "ForeName": "Oliver", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8115-2334"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section Global Health, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}], "LastName": "Bruchhausen", "ForeName": "Walter", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Care Centre, Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre, Moshi, Tanzania."}], "LastName": "Massawe", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "JCO Glob Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "101760170", "ISSNLinking": "2687-8941"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Tanzania"}], "CoiStatement": "The following represents disclosure information provided by authors of this manuscript.
