Gallic acid, corilagin and geraniin were purified from 70% aqueous acetone extract of G. wilfordii Maxim with solvent system n-hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-acetic acid-water (1:10:0.2:0.2:20) by reversed-phase high-speed counter-current chromatography at purities of 94.2, 91.0 and 91.3%, at yields of 89.3, 82.9 and 91.7%, respectively.
