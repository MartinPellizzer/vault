We hypothesize this was due to famine, economic crisis, and political isolation from the international realm. Traditional Korean medicine seems to have served the population, which is in desperate need of treatment amid difficulties in health, while North Korea's Western biomedicine-based health delivery system has been badly affected."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pusan National University School of Korean Medicine, Pusan, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "Byungmook", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jongbae", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Changyon", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Altern Complement Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9508124", "ISSNLinking": "1075-5535"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bibliometrics"}, {"QualifierName": ["organization & administration"], "DescriptorName": "Biomedical Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diffusion of Innovation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Care Reform"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Information Dissemination"}, {"QualifierName": ["organization & administration", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Integrative Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Korean Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Periodicals as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textbooks as Topic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19250000", "10.1089/acm.2008.0294"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
