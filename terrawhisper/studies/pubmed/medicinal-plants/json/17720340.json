Information was obtained from the traditional healers and other experienced persons, having some knowledge on medicinal plants. Fifty-two plants were reported for use in the treatment of various infectious diseases. These plants belong to 29 families, with Papilionaceae being the most represented. Leaves ranked the highest, especially for use in topical preparations. Oral administration was the most frequently used route of administration. Twenty-one percent of the recorded plants were reported for treating venereal diseases, with syphilis and gonorrhea being the most commonly mentioned. Information providers requested feedback with regard to the plants proven scientifically to be toxic in order to avoid risks while offering their services. From this work it was found out that, people in this area commonly use medicinal plants with trust they have built on the curative outcome witnessed. As the first ethnobotanical study in Bunda district recording 52 plants in a small area covered, publication of this work is expected to open up more studies to record many useful medicinal plants unfolded."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Muhimbili University College of Health Sciences, P.O.
