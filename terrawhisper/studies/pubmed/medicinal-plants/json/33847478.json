Dysregulation of these chemical networks is linked to the emergence of diseases. Our research goal is to develop abiotic chemical catalysts that can intervene into life's chemical networks by complementing, surrogating, or exceeding enzymes in living cells or multicellular organisms such as animals or plants. Mending dysregulated networks in pathological states by the chemical catalysts will lead to a new medicinal strategy, catalysis medicine. This research direction will also advance catalysis science, because highly active and selective chemical catalysts must be developed to promote the intended reactions in a complex mixture of life in aqueous solution at body temperature.Epigenetics exists at the crossroads of chemistry, biology, and medicine and is a suitable field to pursue this idea. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones epigenetically regulate chromatin functions and gene transcription and are intimately related to various diseases. Investigating the functions and cross-talk of histone PTMs is crucial for mechanistic elucidation of diseases and their treatments. We launched a program to develop chemical catalysts enabling endogenous histone modifications in living cells without relying on enzymes. We reported two types of chemical catalyst systems so far for synthetic histone acylation. The first system comprised a DNA-binding oligo-4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) catalyst and a phenyl ester acyl donor, PAc-gly. This system promoted histone hyperacetylation in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> sperm chromatin. Using the thus-synthesized hyperacetylated sperm chromatin, we found a novel relationship between histone acetylation and DNA replication. The second system involved a histone-binding catalyst, LANA-DSH, composed of a catalytic motif (DSH) and a histone-binding peptide ligand (LANA), and thioester acyl donors, including endogenous acyl-CoA. This system regioselectively (i.e., selectively to a lysine residue at a specific position) acylated lysine 120 of histone H2B (H2BK120), a lysine residue proximal to the DSH motif defined by binding of the LANA ligand to a nucleosome substrate. This catalyst system was optimized to achieve H2BK120-selective acetylation in living cells without genetic manipulation. The synthetically introduced H2BK120Ac inhibited enzyme-catalyzed ubiquitination at the same lysine residue, acting as a protecting group. H2BK120Ub is a mark recognized by methyltransferase that plays an essential role in mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemia, suggesting the potential of the catalyst system as an epigenetic tool and a cancer therapy. We also discuss the prospects of chemical catalyst-promoted synthetic epigenetics for future PTM studies and therapeutic uses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan."}], "LastName": "Nozaki", "ForeName": "Tamiko", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1977-7648"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kanai", "ForeName": "Motomu", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acc Chem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0157313", "ISSNLinking": "0001-4842"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Esters"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Histones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BH3B64OKL9", "NameOfSubstance": "4-Aminopyridine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PFP1R6P0S8", "NameOfSubstance": "4-dimethylaminopyridine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "4-Aminopyridine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Epigenesis, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Esters"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Histones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Processing, Post-Translational"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "7"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33847478", "10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00144"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
