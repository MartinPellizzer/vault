Bioavailability and the effects of lentil-bound residues of malathion in rats were studied. The amount of bound residues in lentils treated with 14C-malathion at 10 ppm and 50 ppm gradually increased to 9.52% and 13.01% of the initially applied doses after 12 months. When rats were fed these 14C-bound residues, radioactivity excreted in urine accounted for 34.49% of the administered dose. In feces, 26.15% of given dose was methanol-extractable while 18.67% was determined as nonextractable. Various tissues including liver, kidney, fat and lungs contained 8.93% while radioactivity in expired air (14CO2) was low (1.51%). The results indicate that lentil-bound malathion residues are highly bioavailable to rats. Analysis of the lentil material containing bound residues indicated that the main compound was malathion. Lentil-bound malathion residues were administered to albino rats at 0.95 and 6.51 ppm in the feed for 3 months. Body weights were determined during and at the end of the experiment. Terminal organ weights were also determined and a number of blood chemistry parameters were examined. A significant reduction in serum cholinesterase activity and an increase in blood urea nitrogen and in white cell count suggest a toxocological potential of the bound residues."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hacettepe University, Science Faculty, Department of Biology, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Akay", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Elc\u00fcman", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nurcan", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kolankaya", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yilmazoglu", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health B", "NlmUniqueID": "7607167", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.8", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U5N7SU872W", "NameOfSubstance": "Malathion"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Malathion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1527355", "10.1080/03601239209372783"]}}]}
