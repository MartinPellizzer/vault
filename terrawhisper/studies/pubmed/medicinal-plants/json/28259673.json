Herein, we describe the antifungal activity of four Eugenia spp. against Candida albicans biofilms, and further demonstrate insights into their potential mode(s) of action and toxicity in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Extracts from different parts (seeds, pulps, leaves) of E.\u00a0leitonii (EL), E.\u00a0brasiliensis (EB), E.\u00a0myrcianthes (EM) and E.\u00a0involucrata (EI) were obtained (S23\u00b023',W45\u00b039') and chemically characterized by GC/MS. The active extracts were tested against C.\u00a0albicans biofilm viability and architecture, as well as mode of action, and toxicology using RAW 264.7 macrophages and Galleria mellonella larvae. The MIC values ranged from 15.62 to >2000\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. The most active extracts were EL (seed, 15.62 \u03bcg/mL) and EB (leaf and seeds, 31.25 and 15.62 \u03bcg/mL, respectively). Treatment with these extracts at 10xMIC reduced biofilm viability by 54-55% (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) as compared to 42% by nystatin. At 10xMIC, all extracts caused damages to biofilm architecture and integrity, and fewer hyphae remained attached to treated biofilms. None of them was found to interfere with cell wall biosynthesis or complexation with ergosterol. The extracts had low toxicity against macrophages in\u00a0vitro (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05) and G.\u00a0mellonella larvae, with mean in\u00a0vivo LD<sub>50</sub> of 1500\u00a0mg/kg (EL, seeds); 2500\u00a0mg/kg (EB, seeds); and 1250\u00a0mg/kg (EB, leaf). The phenolic compounds epicatechin and gallic acid were the major constituents in the extracts. Our findings may open avenues for the application of these yet unexplored native fruits in the food and pharmaceutical industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
