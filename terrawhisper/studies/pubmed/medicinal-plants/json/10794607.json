The mobility of a spin label bound to lysine residues was monitored at two different pH-induced (neutral and alkaline) association states of proteins extracted from raw and cooked common bean. The molecular weight of the protein complexes was assessed by size exclusion-high performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) of labeled proteins. Upon alkaline dissociation, both native and denatured protein subunits underwent a reassociation process to form soluble complexes of molecular weight higher than the species originally present at neutral pH. However, unlike native proteins, impaired mobility of the spin label was observed in the aggregates that are formed after dissociation of subunits of denatured proteins, indicating a reduced accessibility of lysine residues. Trapping of lysine residues inside protein aggregates may explain limited digestibility in the small intestine of proteins in cooked legumes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Istituto Nazionale della Nutrizione, Roma, Italy. marina@inn.ingrm.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carbonaro", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nicoli", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Musci", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10794607", "10.1021/jf980818s", "jf980818s"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
