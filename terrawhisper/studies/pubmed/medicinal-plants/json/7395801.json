Systemic administration of Shan-dou-gen produced a dose-dependent hypothermia in rats at room temperature (22 degrees C) and below. The hypothermia in response to Shan-dou-gen was brought about by both cutaneous vasodilatation and decreased metabolic heat production. There were no changes in respiratory evaporative heat loss. However, in the heat (30 degrees C), administration of Shan-dou-gen produced no changes in rectal temperature or other thermoregulatory variables. Furthermore, the hypothermia induced by Shan-dou-gen was greatly antagonized by pretreatment of animals with 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine (predominantly a depletor of central serotonin nerve fiber), but not with 6-hydroxydopamine (a relative depletor of central catecholamine nerve fiber). It appears that the hypothermic effects of Shan-dou-gen may be mediated through serotonin release within the brain."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chi", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "P W", "Initials": "PW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Am J Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7901431", "ISSNLinking": "0192-415X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dihydroxytryptamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxydopamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "333DO1RDJY", "NameOfSubstance": "Serotonin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Temperature Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dihydroxytryptamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxydopamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Hypothermia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Serotonin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vasomotor System"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7395801", "10.1142/s0192415x80000086", "S0192415X80000086"]}}]}
