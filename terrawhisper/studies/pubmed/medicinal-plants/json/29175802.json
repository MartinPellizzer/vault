The present review represents different medicinal plants of Pakistan used traditionally for the treatment of variety of ailments caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, their in-vitro activities against P. aeruginosa and phytochemistry. These plants were extracted with different solvents that showed good in-vitro activities against P. aeruginosa, due to the presence of active phytoconstituents including alkaloids, terpenoids etc. Among all the solvents used for extraction process, alcoholic extracts were mostly preferred in Pakistan. However, non-alcoholic solvents like ethyl acetate and chloroform also showed good anti-P. aeruginosa activities. Statistically, increase in concentration (mg/ml) of ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts significantly increase (p=0.000 and p= 0.046) inhibitory activity against P. aeruginosa. This review provides scientific validation of the traditional knowledge in using medicinal plants for the treatment of different diseases caused by this bacterium. Reported Pakistani medicinal plants contain variety of phytochemical compounds that could be very useful in the production of new drugs with fewer side effects on living system compared to some allopathic drugs. This review also provides baseline information for future research studies on the phytochemistry of unexplored plants. Further research studies should be carried out on non-alcoholic extracts that could be helpful in the extraction new compounds, which could lead to the development of some novel drugs in the pharmaceutical industries of Pakistan."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Kohat University of Science and Technology, Kohat, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Bibi", "ForeName": "Roqaia", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Kohat University of Science and Technology, Kohat, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Tariq", "ForeName": "Akash", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Kohat University of Science and Technology, Kohat, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Mussarat", "ForeName": "Sakina", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Kohat University of Science and Technology, Kohat, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Shahid Niaz", "Initials": "SN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Kohat University of Science and Technology, Kohat, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "Hazir", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Kohat University of Science and Technology, Kohat, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Abd Allah", "ForeName": "Elsayed Fathi", "Initials": "EF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy (MAPPRC), College of Pharmacy King Saud University Riyadh Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ullah", "ForeName": "Riaz", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Kohat University of Science and Technology, Kohat, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Adnan", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disk Diffusion Antimicrobial Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29175802"]}}]}
