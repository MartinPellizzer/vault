FH Chen is a valuable traditional herb in China, with saponins being the main medicinal components in its roots. However, leaf diseases are a major factor limiting growth and production of P. notoginseng. Melatonin is a ubiquitous signaling molecule associated with abiotic stress resistance. In this study, we investigated the role of melatonin in leaf disease resistance of P. notoginseng in field conditions. Additionally, saponin concentrations were analyzed to evaluate the suitability of melatonin use in agricultural practice. Our results showed that exogenous application of melatonin promoted the endogenous phytomelatonin accumulation via upregulation of genes involved in its biosynthesis. The application of 10\u00a0\u03bcM melatonin decreased the incidence of leaf diseases (gray mold, round spot, and black spot) by about 40% compared with the solvent control, which might have been due to the increased expression of genes associated with immunity and disease resistance. Furthermore, concentrations of saponins and expression of their biosynthesis-related genes were significantly increased by melatonin. Taken together, the data presented here suggested that melatonin could be used in agricultural management of P. notoginseng because it increased leaf disease resistance and biosynthesis of saponins."], "CopyrightInformation": "Crown Copyright \u00a9 2021.
