The content of total flavonoids in stems were higher than in roots and the lowest in leaves. The dynamic changes of total flavonoids contents in roots and stems of A. cantoniensis were in similar trends. Its total flavonoids content in the two parts of plant increased gradually with the growth and reached the maximum in October, and the content decreased significantly in Feburay of next year. The content of total flavonoids in leaves reached also to the highest value before leaves fell off.", "The optimized extraction method of total flavonoids in Abrus contoniensis was obtained with three times with 80% ethanol at 20 times of volume for 30 min.
