To better utilize this fungus, this study focused on epidermis and internal tissues of five sclerotia from different regions in Jilin, Inner Mongolia, and Heilongjiang, examining their polyphenols, polysaccharides, flavonoids, and total triterpenes contents. And evaluated the extracts from sclerotia for their total antioxidant capacity and scavenging ability of DPPH free radicals. The study also isolated the associated fungi from the epidermis and internal tissues of three sclerotia. Results revealed that the polyphenol content was higher in the epidermis than in internal tissue of every sclerotium. However, flavonoid and total triterpenoid content was lower in the epidermis of every sclerotium. The polysaccharide content was no significant in different parts of three sclerotia, but the epidermal polysaccharide content in two sclerotia was significantly higher than in internal tissues. The internal tissue extracts from tested sclerotia exhibited better scavenging ability of DPPH free radicals than those from the epidermis. There was no significant difference in total antioxidant capacity among different parts of three sclerotia, and the internal tissues' total antioxidant capacity in two sclerotia was higher than the epidermis. The number and species of associated fungi in the internal tissues were far less than that in the epidermis. The study suggests separating the epidermis and internal tissue for medicinal use. The research provides insights into the bioactive components and associated fungi of I. obliquus to inform its practical application in medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.
