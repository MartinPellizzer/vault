The gardens were used, among other things, to grow fruit trees, herbs for the kitchen and for strewing on the floor, and for leisure, with lawns, bowling and flowers. So it would have been natural for the RCP Fellows to wish to have a garden of their own. This was not possible until the College moved into its second and third homes in the City in 1614 and 1674 and good street plans of these sites, and of their gardens, have now become available, though we lack any details of the planting. The fourth home in Pall Mall East in 1815 was landlocked. Therefore when the fifth (and current) home in Regent's Park was opened in 1964 it was splendid to have a large garden, carefully designed, planted and recorded. In 2004 a wonderful transformation took place when the College created a modern physic garden showing the development of medicinal plants through the ages and in many parts of the world."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University College Hospital, London. arthur@hollman.co.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hollman", "ForeName": "Arthur", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Clin Med (Lond)", "NlmUniqueID": "101092853", "ISSNLinking": "1470-2118"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Clin Med (Lond). 2009 Oct;9(5):505. doi: 10.7861/clinmedicine.9-5-505", "PMID": "19886121"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Gardening"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 17th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 18th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 21st Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "London"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Societies, Medical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Annals of the Royal College of Physicians of London.
