The results showed that content of Cu, As, Pb and Cr in soil was being cropland>woodland>wasteland, content of Cd was being woodland>cropland>wasteland, content of Hg was being cropland>woodland>wasteland. According to quality standard of soil environment, soil Cd in woodland, cropland and wasteland all exceeded the state-level standards, soil Cd in woodland exceeded the secondary standard, soil Hg in cropland and wasteland all exceeded the state-level standards. According to technical conditions of green food producing area, soil Cd in woodland exceeded the limit value of standard. According to Green Trade Standards of Importing Exporting Medicinal Plants Preparations,the content of heavy metals of U.rhynchophylla in cropland,woodland and wasteland were correspond to the specification. From the single factor pollution index, the soil in woodland was polluted by Cd. From the comprehensive pollution index, the soils in different functional areas were not contaminated by heavy metals. The enrichment coefficient of heavy metals such as As, Cu, Cr, and Pb in hook of U.rhynchophylla was being wasteland>woodland>cropland, the enrichment coefficient of Cu in hook of U. rhynchophylla in wasteland was more than 1. Except Cu, the enrichment coefficient of other heavy metals was low."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Botanical Garden, Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jia-Chun", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zunyi Center Station of Environmental Protection and Monitoring, Zunyi 563000, China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Xian-Ping", "Initials": "XP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Institute of Biology, Guiyang 550009, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhen-Ming", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Academy of Test and Analysis, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Shao-Xia", "Initials": "SX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qing-Hai", "Initials": "QH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Chang-Hu", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FXS1BY2PGL", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercury"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mercury"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Uncaria"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28929651", "10.4268/cjcmm20162008"]}}]}
