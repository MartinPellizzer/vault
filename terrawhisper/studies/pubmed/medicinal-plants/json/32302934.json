Due to the limited availability of antiseizure drugs (ASDs) in these countries, medicinal plants are the first-line treatment for most epilepsy patients. In Cameroon, a decoction of Cyperus articulatus L. rhizomes is traditionally used to treat epilepsy.", "The aim of this study was to identify and isolate the active compounds responsible for the antiseizure activity of C. articulatus in order to confirm both its traditional medicinal usage and previous in vivo studies on extracts of this plant in mouse epilepsy models.", "The dried rhizomes of C. articulatus were extracted with solvents of increasing polaritie (hexane, dichloromethane, methanol and water). A traditional decoction and an essential oil were also prepared. These extracts were evaluated for antiseizure activity using a larval zebrafish seizure model with seizures induced by the GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonist pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). The hexane extract demonstrated the highest antiseizure activity and was therefore selected for bioassay-guided fractionation. The isolated bioactive compounds were characterized by classical spectroscopic methods. Since they were found to be volatile, they were quantified by GC-FID. In addition, the absorption of the active compounds through the gastrointestinal tract and the blood-brain barrier was evaluated using a hexadecane and a blood-brain barrier parallel artificial membrane permeability assays (HDM-PAMPA and PAMPA-BBB).", "The hexane extract of C. articulatus exhibited the highest antiseizure activity with a reduction of 93% of PTZ-induced seizures, and was therefore subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation in order to isolate the active principles. Four sesquiterpenoids were identified as cyperotundone (1), mustakone (2), 1,2-dehydro-\u03b1-cyperone (3) and sesquichamaenol (4) and exhibited significant antiseizure activity. These volatile compounds were quantified by GC in the hexane extract, the essential oil and the simulated traditional decoction. In addition, the constituents of the hexane extract including compounds 1 and 2 were found to cross the gastrointestinal barrier and the major compound 2 crossed the blood-brain barrier as well.", "These results highlight the antiseizure activity of various sesquiterpene compounds from a hexane extract of C. articulatus dried rhizomes and support its use as a traditional treatment for epilepsy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier GmbH.
