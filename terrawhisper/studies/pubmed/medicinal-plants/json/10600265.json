Rats are monitored for levels of urinary, serum and liver biomarkers, namely, unmetabolised aflatoxin B(1), and its metabolites aflatoxin M(1), and aflatoxin Q(1), over the course of 2 weeks with nut extract therapy following a single-exposure to aflatoxin B(1). Due to the administration of nut extract, the excretion of unmetabolised aflatoxin B(1) was increased in day 1 urine when compared with rats without drug treatment. In serum and liver which were collected on day 16 and the rest of periodical urine samples showed aflatoxin B(1) and its metabolites in undetectable levels. The nut extract administration induced cytochrome P(450), glutathione, and glutathione-S-transferase levels in liver homogenates of aflatoxin B(1)-treated rats. These data seem to indicate that anticarcinogenic action by Semecarpus anacardium nut extract is possibly via suppression of aflatoxin B(1)activation and through interaction with microsomal-activating components. Previous evidence from this laboratory about the potency of Semecarpus anacardium nut extract against aflatoxin B(1)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma together with the present results suggest that extremely effective therapeutic protection can be achieved by this drug against aflatoxin B(1)-mediated ill effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2000 Academic Press."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biochemistry, Dr. A.L.M.
