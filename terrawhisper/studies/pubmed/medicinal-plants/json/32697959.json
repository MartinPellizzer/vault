As helminthosis remains a major constraint to profitable livestock production worldwide, a precarious situation aggravated by the advent of resistant parasites, the discovery of new anthelmintics is a priority, necessitating exploration of medicinal plants for their anthelmintic principles.", "To identify and characterise compounds with anthelmintic activity from the leaf of Sarcocephalus latifolius.", "Powdered S.\u00a0latifolius leaves were extracted by successive maceration with n-hexane, chloroform and acetone. The dried extracts were evaluated for anthelmintic activity against Haemonchus placei adult worms, and the most active extract was subjected to bioassay-guided chromatographic separations. The isolated compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity against the mammalian HeLa and MC3T3-E1 cell lines, using alamar blue and CellTitreGlo<sup>TM</sup> to quantify cell viability. LC<sub>50</sub> values were computed from the in vitro anthelmintic activity data by fitting to a non-linear regression equation (variable slope). Isolated compounds were characterized using spectroscopic and mass spectrometric analyses.", "Anthelmintic activity LC<sub>50</sub> values for n-hexane, chloroform and acetone extracts were 47.85, 35.76 and 5.72 (mg/mL), respectively. Chromatographic separation of acetone extract afforded two bioactive epimers, identified as vincosamide (LC<sub>50</sub> 14.7\u202fmg/mL) and strictosamide (LC<sub>50</sub> 12.8\u202fmg/mL). Cytotoxicity evaluation showed that, below 200\u202f\u03bcg/mL (400\u202f\u03bcM), neither compound was toxic to the HeLa or MC3T3-E1 cells.", "Vincosamide and strictosamide could serve as novel scaffolds for the development of anthelmintic derivatives with improved potency and helminth selectivity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
