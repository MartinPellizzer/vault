The pathogen produced abundant black, irregular sclerotia on surface of diseased plants and potato dextrose agar. The conidiophores and clusters of oval conidia resembled a grape-like cluster, the size of conidia was 9.70-13.70 \u03bcm [average of (11.32\u00b10.82)\u03bcm]\u00d77.05-9.12 \u03bcm [average of (8.24\u00b10.48)\u03bcm], the microconidia produced on potato dextrose agar were spherical,and the size was \uff083.34\u00b10.31\uff09 \u03bcm,the pathogen was identified as Botrytis sp based on morphological characteristics. The DNA sequence analysis of the G3PDH, HSP60, RPB2 genes placed the pathogen in a single clade that outside defined species of Botrytis, so the pathogen could be identified as a new species of Botrytis. The pathogen requires 20 \u00b0C, pH 8, darkness or low light condition for the best growth."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming 650205, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Wei-Si", "Initials": "WS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development\uff0c Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College\uff0c Beijing 100193\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming 650205, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Shi-Wu", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming 650205, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming 650205, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Zhi-Yuan", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming 650205, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Lin-Yu", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming 650205, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Li-Ying", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming 650205, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Melanthiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30111050", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180510.003"]}}]}
