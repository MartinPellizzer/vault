Mayer G115 modulates pro-inflammatory cytokine production in mice throughout the increase of macrophage toll-like receptor 4 expression during physical stress.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "546", "EndPage": "551", "MedlinePgn": "546-51"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["The effect of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer G115 on inflammatory cytokine production and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) RNA expression was examined in mice during 4 weeks of swimming stress. Mice were assigned to four groups: (1) control (no exercise); (2) control-G115 (25 mg/kg/day p.o.); (3) stress (kept swimming for 60 min daily); and (4) stress-G115 (25 mg/kg/day p.o. and kept swimming for 60 min daily). Peritoneal macrophages were collected at rest each week. RNA was extracted and processed for real-time PCR. An aliquot of macrophages was lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated for TNF-alpha and IL-1beta production. Different expression patterns between untreated and treated groups, and between TLR2 and TLR4 were found. High levels of TLR4 expression in the control-G115 group were detectable significantly at the first, and at the second week (P<.01 and P<.001, respectively). In the stress group, TLR4 showed a peak at the first week (P<.001 vs. controls) and then decreased gradually. In the stress-G115 group, the levels of TLR4 expression increased gradually at the second week (P<.001 vs. controls) with a peak at the third week (P<.001). Levels of TLR4 expression at the fourth week had returned to the basal level. Levels of TLR2 expression were not affected by treatment in all groups. A significant increase of LPS-stimulated IL-1beta and TNF-alpha concentrations was present in trained animals with similar patterns of TLR4 expression. These results support the hypothesis that enhancement of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine can be linked to an increased expression of TLR4 on macrophages. Moreover, G115 increases the expression of TLR4 and the release of cytokines with a different pattern compared to the stressed alone group."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Chemotherapy and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Milan, via Vanvitelli 32, 20129 Milan, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pannacci", "ForeName": "Marilou", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lucini", "ForeName": "Valeria", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Colleoni", "ForeName": "Federica", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martucci", "ForeName": "Cataldo", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grosso", "ForeName": "Silvia", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sacerdote", "ForeName": "Paola", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scaglione", "ForeName": "Francesco", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Brain Behav Immun", "NlmUniqueID": "8800478", "ISSNLinking": "0889-1591"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1beta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tlr4 protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toll-Like Receptor 4"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "63231-63-0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1beta"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Physical Exertion"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "RNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Statistics, Nonparametric"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Swimming"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Toll-Like Receptor 4"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16469481", "10.1016/j.bbi.2005.11.007", "S0889-1591(05)00345-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
