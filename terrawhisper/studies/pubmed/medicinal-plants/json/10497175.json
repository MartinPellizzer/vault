These compounds are formed through the combined actions of a 15(S)-lipoxygenase and a hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HPETE) isomerase. The compounds were formed when either arachidonic acid or 15-HPETE were used as substrates. Both the \"A\"-type and the \"B\"-type products are formed although the B-type compounds are formed in greater relative quantities. Chiral phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis confirmed the formation of hepoxilins from 15(S)- but not 15(R)-HPETE, indicating high stereoselectivity of the isomerase. Additionally, the lipoxygenase was of the 15(S)-type as only 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid was formed when arachidonic acid was used as substrate. The structures of the products were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the methyl ester trimethylsilyl ether derivatives as well as after characteristic epoxide ring opening catalytically with hydrogen leading to dihydroxy products. That 15(S)-lipoxygenase activity is of functional importance in garlic was shown by the inhibition of root growth by BW 755C, a dual cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, a lipoxygenase inhibitor. Additional biological studies were carried out with the purified intact 14(S), 15(S)-hepoxilins, which were investigated for hepoxilin-like actions in causing the release of intracellular calcium in human neutrophils. The 14,15-hepoxilins dose-dependently caused a rise in cytosolic calcium, but their actions were 5-10-fold less active than 11(S), 12(S)-hepoxilins derived from 12(S)-HPETE. These studies provide evidence that 15(S)-lipoxygenase is functionally important to normal root growth and that HPETE isomerization into the hepoxilin-like structure may be ubiquitous; the hepoxilin-evoked release of calcium in human neutrophils, which is receptor-mediated, is sensitive to the location within the molecule of the hydroxyepoxide functionality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada M5G 1X8."}], "LastName": "Reynaud", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Demin", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pace-Asciak", "ForeName": "C R", "Initials": "CR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Cell Surface"}, {"RegistryNumber": "127128-05-6", "NameOfSubstance": "11-glutathionylhepoxilin A3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "71799-95-6", "NameOfSubstance": "10-hydroxy-11,12-epoxyeicosa-5,8,14-trienoic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.13.11.33", "NameOfSubstance": "Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.3.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Intramolecular Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.3.99.6", "NameOfSubstance": "hydroperoxide isomerase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FC398RK06S", "NameOfSubstance": "8,11,14-Eicosatrienoic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "8,11,14-Eicosatrienoic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intramolecular Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Cell Surface"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10497175", "10.1074/jbc.274.40.28213", "S0021-9258(19)52038-5"]}}]}
