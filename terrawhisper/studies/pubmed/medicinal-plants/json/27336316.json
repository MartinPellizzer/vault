In this regard, an integrative strategy for efficient MS-guided isolation of antifungal compounds has been developed. First, off-line HPLC antifungal activity-based profiling and HPLC-PDA-MS profiling were used to localize the compounds of interest on the analytical scale. Then, the analytical gradient was geometrically transferred to the flash chromatographic level. Finally, an MS-triggered isolation of the localized bioactive molecules was realized using high-resolution flash chromatographic columns (15\u2009\u00b5m spherical particles) coupled to a single quadrupole mass spectrometer via a splitter system. This isolation strategy was applied for the MS-targeted purification of antifungal principles from the liverwort Chiloscyphus polyanthos. This rational methodology has high potential for the targeted large-scale purification of bioactive compounds, avoiding the need to repeat a given bioassay at each isolation step. Seven sesquiterpene lactones were isolated, of which five were found to be bioactive and one was reported as a new compound. The absolute configuration of some compounds was established for the first time by electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Geneva, University of Lausanne, Geneva, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Azzollini", "ForeName": "Antonio", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Geneva, University of Lausanne, Geneva, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Favre-Godal", "ForeName": "Quentin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Products Chemistry, Key Lab of Chemical Biology of the Ministry of Education, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jiaozhen", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Geneva, University of Lausanne, Geneva, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Marcourt", "ForeName": "Laurence", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, G.\u200aC., Evin, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ebrahimi", "ForeName": "Samad Nejad", "Initials": "SN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Products Chemistry, Key Lab of Chemical Biology of the Ministry of Education, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shuqi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Products Chemistry, Key Lab of Chemical Biology of the Ministry of Education, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Peihong", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Products Chemistry, Key Lab of Chemical Biology of the Ministry of Education, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Lou", "ForeName": "Hongxiang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Geneva, University of Lausanne, Geneva, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Guillarme", "ForeName": "Davy", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Geneva, University of Lausanne, Geneva, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Queiroz", "ForeName": "Emerson Ferreira", "Initials": "EF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Geneva, University of Lausanne, Geneva, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Wolfender", "ForeName": "Jean-Luc", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Candida albicans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatophyta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27336316", "10.1055/s-0042-108207"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
