Two medicinal plants viz., Turmeric (Curcuma longa) and Amla (Emblica officinalis) extracts were examined for antiproliferative effect through Neutral Red-Dye uptake assay on Vero and MDA-MB 231 cell lines. A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the expression of genes while GAPDH expression was used as an internal control. Expression of BID was up-regulated in methanolic turmeric extract-induced MDA-MB 231 cells while Caspases 3,8 expressions were the same in induced and uninduced MDA-MB 231 cells. Activated BID cleaved into tBID and activated the intrinsic pathway which caused death in methanolic turmeric extract-induced cancerous cells. Ethanolic extracts of turmeric exerted the strongest antiproliferative effects on Vero and methanolic extracts on MDA-MB 231 cells. The morphological studies of cell lines and gene expression analysis of turmeric methanolic extract-treated cells showed activation of apoptosis via converting BID into t-BID (intrinsic pathway) and activating Caspase-3 and Caspase-8 (extrinsic pathway). With the differential cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis in induced cancer cells in comparison to uninduced cancerous cells, hence turmeric is a natural source of new anti-cancerous compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Kinnaird College for Women, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Younas", "ForeName": "Hooria", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Kinnaird College for Women, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ajmal", "ForeName": "Sidra", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry; Human Genetics and Molecular Biology, University of Health Sciences (UHS), Lahore, Pakistan & Department of Cell and System Biology, University of Toronto, Canada."}], "LastName": "Mahmood", "ForeName": "Nasir", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Sciences & Humanities, National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (NUCES), Foundation for Advancement of Science and Technology (FAST), Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shahid", "ForeName": "Saman", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Kinnaird College for Women, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Zafar", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Death Domain"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phyllanthus emblica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Curcuma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Death Domain"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mammals"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "8"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37530151"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
