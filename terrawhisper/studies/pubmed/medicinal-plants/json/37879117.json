Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza) is a valuable Chinese herbal medicine commonly used to treat cardiovascular diseases; its active ingredients are tanshinones and phenolic acids, which primarily accumulate in roots. Here, we conducted a targeted metabolic analysis of S. miltiorrhiza roots at 3 distinct growth stages: 40 d old (r40), 60 d old (r60), and 90 d old (r90). The contents of tanshinones (cryptotanshinone, tanshinone I, tanshinone IIA, and rosmariquinone) and phenolic acids (rosmarinic acid and salvianolic acid B) gradually increased during plant development. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and transcriptome sequencing of roots at the 3 growth stages revealed an increased level of DNA methylation in the CHH context (H represents A, T, or C) context at r90 compared with r40 and r60. Increased DNA methylation levels were associated with elevated expression of various genes linked to epigenetic regulations, including CHROMOMETHYLASE2 (SmCMT2), Decrease in DNA Methylation 1 (SmDDM1), Argonaute 4 (SmAGO4), and DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (SmDRM1). Moreover, expression levels of many genes involved in tanshinone and salvianolic acid biosynthesis, such as copalyldiphosphate synthase 5 (SmCPS5), cytochrome P450-related enzyme (SmCYP71D464), geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (SmGGPPS1), geranyl diphosphate synthase (SmGPPS), hydroxyphenylpyruvate reductase (SmHPPR), and hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (SmHPPD), were altered owing to hyper-methylation, indicating that DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating tanshinone and phenolic acid accumulation. Our data shed light on the epigenetic regulation of root growth and the biosynthesis of active ingredients in S. miltiorrhiza, providing crucial clues for further improvement of active compound production via molecular breeding in S. miltiorrhiza."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.
