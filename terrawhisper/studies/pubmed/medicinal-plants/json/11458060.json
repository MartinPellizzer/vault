We administered 250 gm. poppy seed orally in the evening and the urinary excretion of poppy seed was evaluated during the next 2 days.", "Of the 17 patients 11 excreted the black seeds in the urine for 2 days after oral intake of the seeds. The diagnosis was supported by conventional diagnostic methods in 9 of the 11 cases, while in the remaining 2 the poppy seed test was the only preoperative diagnostic procedure that proved the existence of a fistula. The diagnosis was confirmed by surgical exploration in all 11 patients. In the remaining 6 patients with a nonspecific complaint vesico-enteric fistula was excluded by conventional diagnostic techniques and by the success of nonoperative therapy.", "The oral intake of poppy seed is a simple and ready available method for diagnosing vesico-enteric fistula.
