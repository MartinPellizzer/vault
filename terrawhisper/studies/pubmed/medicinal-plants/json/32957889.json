The computational approach was employed in the generation of the QSAR model using automated QSAR, and in the docking of ligands from Melissa officinalis with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. The best model obtained was KPLS_Radial_ 28 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.8548 and Q<sup>2</sup>=0.6474, which was used in predicting the bioactivity of the lead compounds. Molecular mechanics based MM-GBSA confirmed salvanolic acid A as the compound with the highest free energy and predicted bioactivity of 4.777; it interacted with His-41 of the catalytic dyad (Cys145-His41) of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>), as this may hinder the cutting of inactive viral protein into active ones capable of replication.", "Salvanolic acid A can be further evaluated as a potential M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Bioinformatics and Molecular Biology Unit, Federal University of Technology Akure, Ondo State, P.M.B 704, Akure, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Elekofehinti", "ForeName": "Olusola O", "Initials": "OO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Bioinformatics and Molecular Biology Unit, Federal University of Technology Akure, Ondo State, P.M.B 704, Akure, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Iwaloye", "ForeName": "Opeyemi", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Bioinformatics and Molecular Biology Unit, Federal University of Technology Akure, Ondo State, P.M.B 704, Akure, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Famusiwa", "ForeName": "Courage D", "Initials": "CD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Bioinformatics and Molecular Biology Unit, Federal University of Technology Akure, Ondo State, P.M.B 704, Akure, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Akinseye", "ForeName": "Olanrewaju", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemical Toxicology Unit, Department of Chemistry, CCNE, Federal University of Santa Maria, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Rocha", "ForeName": "Joao B T", "Initials": "JBT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Discov Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "101157212", "ISSNLinking": "1570-1638"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coronavirus Protease Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.28", "NameOfSubstance": "Coronavirus 3C Proteases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Coronavirus 3C Proteases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Coronavirus Protease Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Melissa"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19 Drug Treatment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "30"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32957889", "10.2174/1570163817999200918103705", "CDDT-EPUB-110057"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
