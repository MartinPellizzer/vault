The so-called phytoestrogens, like genistein and daidzein in soy, can bind to estrogen receptors and therefore interfere with the action of estrogen itself, a well-established risk factor for breast, ovarian and endometrial cancers. Although not all results are consistent, there is good evidence for protective influence of soy products against all three of these cancers. In addition, there have been many reports of preventive effects in the prostate. With ginseng, whether white or red, the included polyphenol compounds and saponins may play roles in many different organs, although preventive potential is perhaps best documented for gastric cancer. The traditional diets in Eastern Asia may need more emphasis in efforts to combat the growing problem of cancer in this region of the world."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Cohort Study Branch, Research Insitute for National Cancer Control, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea. jskim@ncc.re.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jeongson", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Thailand", "MedlineTA": "Asian Pac J Cancer Prev", "NlmUniqueID": "101130625", "ISSNLinking": "1513-7368"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Primary Prevention"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}], "NumberOfReferences": "106"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19256735"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
