This study examines the clinical, uterotonic, and luteolytic effects of freshly prepared Zoapatle infusions administered orally to 6 women for 2 days prior to pregnancy termination by vacuum aspiration. The women were aged 24 to 37, of 6 to 7 weeks' gestation, and with body weight ranging from 52 to 62 kg. Daily dosage of the extracts varied between 1.0 and 1.4 kg equivalent of dry leaves/kg of body weight. A matched group of 6 pregnant women who served as controls were given the same volume of commercial tea according to the same schedule before vacuum aspiration. Clinical and laboratory parameters were assessed in each of the 12 subjects on 4 different occasions: 1) the day following surgical interruption of gestation; 2) 1 week after the administration of the 1st dose of Zoapatle; 3) 2 weeks after the administration of the 1st dose of Zoapatle, and 4) 6 weeks after administration of 1st dose of Zoapatle. The results show that oral administration of Zoapatle decocts produces a significant uterotonic effect accompanied by cervical dilation at doses in which no luteolytic effect can be shown. The doses administered in this series were well tolerated by the patients as evidenced by the absence of gastrointestinal or other side effects. Zoapatle extracts may be useful in the development of an orally active and safe abortifacient."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["799341", "00083435"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Abortifacient Agents", "Abortion, Drug Induced", "Abortion, Induced", "Clinical Research", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Estradiol", "Family Planning", "Fertility Control, Postconception", "Health", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Plants, Medicinal--administraction and dosage", "Plants, Medicinal--side effects", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy, First Trimester", "Progesterone", "Reproduction", "Research Methodology"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "114055", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1979", "Month": "11", "Day": "28"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "06", "Day": "15"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0002-9378", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "135", "Issue": "4", "PubDate": {"Year": "1979", "Month": "Oct", "Day": "15"}}, "Title": "American journal of obstetrics and gynecology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Am J Obstet Gynecol"}, "ArticleTitle": "Clinical effects of orally administered extracts of Montanoa tomentosa in early human pregnancy.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "480", "EndPage": "484", "MedlinePgn": "480-4"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Freshly prepared aqueous decocts of the Mexican plant Montanoa tomentosa (Zoapatle) were administered orally to six women in the early stages of pregnancy for two days prior to the interruption of gestation by vacuum aspiration. The daily dose administered varied between 1.0 and 1.4 gm-equivalent of dry leaves per kilogram of body weight. A comparable control group of six pregnant women received the same volume of commercial tea according to the same schedule before vacuum aspiration. Administration of Zoapatle extracts resulted in a menstrual-like cramp and a significant dilatation of the cervix in all subjects studied. In four of the six subjects the menstrual-like pains were associated with bleeding. No comparable effects were observed in the control group. Peroral administration of Zoapatle decocts did not produce any cardiovascular changes, and it did not influence the hematologic status, liver, kidney, and thyroid function, blood lipids, proteins, and electrolyte status. Under the experimental conditions used, Zoapatle extracts did not induce a luteolytic effect judged from the plasma progesterone (and estradiol) levels. It is concluded that peroral administration of freshly prepared decocts of Zoapatle in early pregnancy exerts a distinct uterotonic effect and induces cervical dilatation and uterine bleeding. These changes are not associated with any effect on the plasma levels of progesterone and estradiol or with any untoward side effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Landgren", "ForeName": "B M", "Initials": "BM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aedo", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hagenfeldt", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Diczfalusy", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Obstet Gynecol", "NlmUniqueID": "0370476", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Placebos"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4G7DS2Q64Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Progesterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4TI98Z838E", "NameOfSubstance": "Estradiol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cervix Uteri"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Corpus Luteum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Estradiol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Haplorhini"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macaca mulatta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Placebos"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Trimester, First"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Progesterone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Uterine Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Uterine Hemorrhage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vacuum Extraction, Obstetrical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["114055", "10.1016/0002-9378(79)90435-6", "0002-9378(79)90435-6"]}}]}
