Artemisia nilagirica (AR) has a long history of use in Indian traditional medicine to combat a wide variety of diseases including cancer.", "Considering the vast potential of traditional healing plants to deliver safer, less toxic and efficient chemotherapeutics, we have examined anticancer activity of ethanolic extract, bioactive fractions and sub-fractions of AR against different human cancer cell lines along with their phytochemical analysis to understand the insights of novel anticancer activities for further preclinical studies.", "Fresh plant material of AR was procured from the wild, dried and ground. The grinded materials was extracted in ethanol (AR-01) and fractionated into butanol (AR-02), ethyl acetate (AR-03), hexane (AR-04) and water (AR-05). The cytotoxicity was evaluated against three different human cancer cell lines, i.e. colon (DLD-1), lung (A-549), and breast (MCF-7) using Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay along with non-cancerous VERO cells as control and doxorubicin (DOX) as positive control. As we observed strong cytotoxicity of AR-03 and AR-04 fractions against tested cells and marked cytotoxic effects particularly in colon cancer cell lines, we further re-fractionated, AR-03 into (AR-03A, AR-03B, AR-03C, AR-03D, AR-03E) and AR-04 into (AR-04A, AR-04B, AR-04C) sub-fractions by column chromatography and investigated against the same panel of cell lines in addition to one more colon cancer cell line (HT-29). Phytochemical analysis was performed through HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS fragmentation.", "Ethyl acetate (AR-03) and hexane (AR-04) fractions were found to be the most cytotoxic against all the tested cell lines. Further, AR-03E and AR-04A sub-fractions were found more specific cytotoxic selectively against DLD-1 cancer cell lines at 100\u00b5g/ml concentration. HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS determination revealed the presence of 17 compounds in AR-01. Among them, 4 compounds were reported for the first time in this species. However, 3 identified compounds (artemorin, \u03b2-santonin and caryophyllene oxide) in AR-03E sub-fraction were commonly present in each bioactive fraction and may be considered as potential and safest cytotoxic agents for anticancer activity.", "Experimental evidences reported in this paper for anticancer activity validate the traditional wisdom of Artemisia nilagirica as an anticancer herbal drug. To our knowledge, this is our first novel observation of cytotoxicity and selectivity of ethyl acetate and hexane sub-fraction of AR-01 i.e. AR-03E and AR-04A respectively against DLD-1 human cancer cell lines. HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS determination attributes the identification of cytotoxic compounds which may be used for further preclinical studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
