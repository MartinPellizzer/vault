We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials database, PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese National Knowledge Internet, Chinese Biomedicine Database, and VIP. All studies were analyzed using the criteria of the Cochrane Handbook and were assessed in terms of quality and the risk of bias. Review Manager ver. 5.3.5 software was used for the data analysis, and GRADE profiler software was employed to evaluate quality.Two studies were included (n\u200a=\u200a126 Chinese participants). We found that compared with against conventional treatment, one Chinese medicinal herbs formula plus conventional treatment reduced 24-hours urinary total protein (mean differences -3.16\u200ag/24\u200ah, 95% confidence intervals -4.03 to -2.29), and two Chinese medicinal herbs formulae increased serum albumin levels (mean differences 3.18\u200ag/L, 95% confidence intervals 1.12 to 5.52; I2\u200a=\u200a0%).Chinese medicinal herbs formulae may reduce 24-hours urinary total protein and increase serum levels of albumin.
