The aim of this study was to investigate the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> bioactivation of nomilin and the role in nomilin-induced hepatotoxicity. Microsomal incubations of nomilin supplemented with NADPH and GSH or NAL resulted in the detection of six conjugates (M1-M6). The structures of the metabolites were characterized based on LC-HRMS and NMR. Nomilin was bioactivated to a reactive <i>cis</i>-butene-dial (BDA) intermediate dependent on NADPH, and this intermediate suffered from the reaction with the nucleophiles (GSH and NAL) to form stable adducts. M1-M4 were identified as pyrrole derivatives, and M5 and M6 were pyrrolinone derivatives. M1 was further chemically synthesized and characterized by <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy. M1 was the major metabolite detected in mice bile. Pretreatment with ketoconazole significantly reduced the formation of M1 in mice bile, while pretreatment with rifampicin significantly increased the formation of M1. Chemical inhibition together with recombinant human CYP450 phenotyping demonstrated that CYP3A4 was the major enzyme contributing to the bioactivation of nomilin. Toxicity study suggested that nomilin displayed dose-dependent liver injury in mice, while tetrahydro-nomilin was found to be nonhepatotoxic. Pretreatment with ketoconazole prevented mice from nomilin-induced liver injury. The liver injury induced by nomilin was deteriorated when the mice were pretreated with rifampicin. These findings provide evidence that CYP3A4-mediated bioactivation was indispensable in nomilin-induced hepatotoxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan Province, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Heath and Medical Technology, Hefei Institute of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, Anhui Province, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qingwang", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heart Center of Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Central China Fuwai Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan Province, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Yajuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan Province, China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Xianfang", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan Province, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yuanlong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan Province, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ci", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4904-0025"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan Province, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Chem Res Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8807448", "ISSNLinking": "0893-228X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoxepins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Limonins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DRM0753K4T", "NameOfSubstance": "nomilin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.55", "NameOfSubstance": "CYP3A4 protein, human"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Benzoxepins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Limonins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32633501", "10.1021/acs.chemrestox.0c00228"]}}]}
