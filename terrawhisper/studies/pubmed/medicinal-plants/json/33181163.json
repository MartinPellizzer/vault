In the present study, we document the toxic plants used as medicines in the Rif, intending to assess the knowledge of indigenous people on the toxicity of the natural products used. Ethnobotanical survey was conducted in the Rif, northern Morocco between June 2016 and June 2018 using semi-structured questionnaires and focus groups. An investigation of the scientific literature was conducted to sustain or verify the claimed toxicological information. A total of 84 species of plants belonging to 67 genera and 30 families were reported as being used in the prevention and treatment of diseases. The families reported to be most representatives of these kinds of plants are Asteraceae and Fabaceae (7 species). However, the highly toxic plant prescribed was Rosmarinus officinalis L. Leaf was the most commonly used plant part, and the majority of herbal remedies were prepared from a decoction (40.6%). The results of this investigation showed that the local people in the Rif are still dependent on herbal medicine. These species used for remedial purposes are noted to have a potential toxic impact associated with their irrational consumption. Therefore, we recommend that attention should be observed when using them as medicinal sources."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
