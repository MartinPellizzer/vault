After intragastric administration 12-week period continuously, the biomechanical and the bone histomorphometric parameters of the femur of the rats in every group were determined, respectively, including percentage of trabecular bone volume (TBV%), percentage of trabecular osteoid (TOS%), mean osteoid width (MOSW), percentage of mineralizing surface (MdS%), percentage of double mineralizing surface (DMds%), percentage of DMds/MdS (%), percentage of travecular formation surface (TFS%), percentage of trabecular resorption surface (TRS%), mineral apposition rate (MAR), mineralizing lag time (MLT).", "The maximum loading, deflection, the maximum strain of the femur in the OVX group was 125.78 +/- 15.48 (N), 1.87 +/- 0.22 (mm), 9.34 +/- 1.10 (%), it was significantly lower than that in the sham group ( P< 0.05, P < 0.01), respectively.
