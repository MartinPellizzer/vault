Virus infection decreased the growth rate of the plants by about one-third; however, virus-free plants disappeared more than twice as quickly as infected plants as a result of grazing by herbivores. In palatability trials using grated carrot bait, caged young rabbits preferred bait mixed with powdered virus-free K.rubicunda leaves to that mixed with virus-infected leaf powder. However, 'polyamine extracts' of the leaves did not have a comparable effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gibbs", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Intervirology", "NlmUniqueID": "0364265", "ISSNLinking": "0300-5526"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyamines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecology"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7358509", "10.1159/000149105"]}}]}
