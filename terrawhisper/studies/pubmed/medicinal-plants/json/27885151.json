He performed procedures with crude surgical instruments that paved the path for today's operations. However, his existence is shrouded in myth and mystery. Sushruta belonged to a rich heritage of learned scholars and practiced and taught surgery at Benares University around 600BC. His work is assembled into a monumental thesis, possibly the first text book on surgery, the 'Sushruta Samhita' where he describes surgical instruments, procedures, illnesses, medicinal plants and preparation, dissection and the study of human anatomy, embryology and fractures. Sushruta is perhaps best known for the nasal reconstruction flap which is still used in different versions. For all his contributions, he has been aptly titled 'Father of Plastic Surgery'."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Surgery, Harlem Hospital, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Bath", "ForeName": "Khushbir", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Department of Internal Medicine, Western Michigan University School of Medicine, MI, USA."}], "LastName": "Aggarwal", "ForeName": "Sourabh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Department of Gastroenterology, PGIMER, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Vishal", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Biography", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Med Biogr", "NlmUniqueID": "9308895", "ISSNLinking": "0967-7720"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Surgery, Plastic"}], "PersonalNameSubjectList": [{"LastName": "Sushruta"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27885151", "10.1177/0967772016643463", "0967772016643463"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
