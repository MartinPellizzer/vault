ALI model was established by i.v. oleic acid (0.05 mL x kg(-1)) in these groups, and then i.v. above drugs respectively, while in control group, the same volume of normal saline was given. The respiratory amplitude and rate were observed, and blood samples were taken from cervical artery for blood-gas analysis before and at 30, 60, 120 min after oleic acid or normal saline administration. At the end of experiment, the concentration of LDH, CAT and MDA in the lung tissue were measured and pathologic changes of lung tissue were observed microscopically.", "Compared with oleic acid group, the respiratory amplitude markedly enhanced (P < 0.05) and respiratory rate lowered (P < 0.05) in the low, middle and high dose groups of Qingkailing and MP injection. On the 30 min of treatment, PaO2 increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the low and middle dose groups of combined Qingkailing and MP injection; PaCO2 decreased markedly (P < 0.05) on the 120 min of treatment in each treatment group. The level of LDH significantly increased (P < 0.05), CAT and MDA decreased (P < 0.05) in the middle and high groups of Qingkailing and MP injection. The low and middle dose groups of combined Qingkailing and MP injection can alleviate the pathological changes induced by oleic acid.", "The curative effect of the low dose group of combined Qingkailing and MP for the ALI induced by oleic acid was better than Qingkailing and MP alone, while the big dose groups of Qingkailing and MP alone better than the combination at the same dosage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Material Medica, China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100700, China. duguiyou1942@vip.sina.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Gui-you", "Initials": "GY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Ri-xin", "Initials": "RX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chun-ying", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiu-rong", "Initials": "XR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Hai-feng", "Initials": "HF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Zi-lun", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Shuang-rong", "Initials": "SR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hui", "ForeName": "Lian-qiang", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Xiao-xin", "Initials": "XX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2UMI9U37CP", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X4W7ZR7023", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylprednisolone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Gas Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Methylprednisolone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16075718"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
