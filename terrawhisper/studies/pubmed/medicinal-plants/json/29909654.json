Taking as a case study an effort by administrators in the seventeenth-century German princely state of Saxe-Gotha to enlist foresters and herb-women to catalog the medicinal plants of the territory, this article analyzes the varied forms of paperwork produced in the process, including an extremely unusual table, and argues that the table represented an effort to produce a synoptic visualization, akin to but not identical to a map, of the location of the territory's herbs. While this table may not have ultimately succeeded as a viable paper technology, due to problems of incommensurability, it demonstrates the role of administrative practices and state actors in experimenting with information about the natural world during the early modern period."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "History Department, Stony Brook University, USA."}], "LastName": "Cooper", "ForeName": "Alix", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"Acronym": "ERC_", "Agency": "European Research Council", "Country": "International"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Hist Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "17340520R", "ISSNLinking": "0073-2753"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29909654", "10.1177/0073275318776515"]}}]}
