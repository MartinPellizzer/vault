The antibacterial activity of this study plant is also analyzed.", "<i>C. pedata</i> var. <i>glabra</i> belongs to the family Vitaceae, commonly known as \"Kattuppirandai\" is one such endemic and endangered species in Thaisholai, Nilgiris South Division, Western Ghats. With the patronage of veteran ethnic group traditional knowledge of this region, the species <i>C. pedata</i> var. <i>glabra</i> was selected for the pharmacognostical examination and antibacterial screening. There were no pharmacognostical reports of this plant, specifically to determine the anatomical and other physicochemical standards required for its quality control. The current study deals with pharmacognostical parameters for the aerial parts of study plant, which mainly consists of macromorphological and microanatomical characters, physicochemical constants (ash values and extractive values), fluorescence analysis, and phytochemical screening, one of the WHO accepted parameter for the identification of medicinal plants. The pharmacognostical exploration was undertaken for this species with the purpose of sketch the pharmacopeial standards. The antibacterial activity of this plant confirms the therapeutic power.", "The information obtained from pharmacognostical studies will be of used for supplementary pharmacological and therapeutical evaluation of the species and will assist in standardization for quality, purity, and authentication with the help, of which adulteration and substitution can be prevented. The antibacterial activity of this plant confirm the traditional knowledge of local healers on the wound healing property of this species and also suggest this plant species can be used as a promising source for the development of new pharmaceuticals that address the therapeutic needs to cure infectious diseases.", "The species <i>C. pedata</i> var. <i>glabra</i> was selected for present research work, since this species is listed in Red data book and has a wider use for different ailments among the tribal population of Thiashola due to its high medicinal value. Pharmacognostical profile was generated from macroscopical analysis, microscopical studies, powder analysis, physico-chemical constituent values, fluorescence analysis and preliminary phytochemical evaluation. The antibacterial activity of this plant confirms the therapeutic power. <b>Abbreviations Used:</b> WHO: World Health Organization; IUCN: International Union for the Conservation of Nature."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Vellalar College for Women, Erode, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Sharmila", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Vellalar College for Women, Erode, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Kalaichelvi", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Vellalar College for Women, Erode, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Dhivya", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Vellalar College for Women, Erode, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Premamalini", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Vellalar College for Women, Erode, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Abirami", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Vellalar College for Women, Erode, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Jayanthi", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacognosy Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101558769", "ISSNLinking": "0974-8490"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Jeyaprakash K, Ayyanar M, Geetha KN, Sekar T.
