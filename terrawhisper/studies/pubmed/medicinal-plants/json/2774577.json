Illumination of intact protoplasts and incubation of leaf extract with DTT inactivate about 25-35% of the total G6PDH activity. In the leaf extract, however, further loss of activity is observed if NADP is absent. Light- and DTT-inactivated chloroplast G6PDH can be reactivated by oxidation with sodium tetrathionate or the thiol oxidant diamide. Chloroplast G6PDH is as sensitive toward reductive enzyme modulation in a stromal extract as are other light/dark modulated enzymes, e.g., NADP-malate dehydrogenase. Also, glutathione, provided it is kept reduced, is sufficient to cause inactivation. Light- and DTT-induced inactivation are shown to be due to a Km shift with respect to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) from 1 to 35 and 43 mM, respectively, and with respect to NADP from 10 to 50 microM without any significant change of the Vmax. NADPH competitively (NADP) inhibits the enzyme (Ki = 8 microM). Reactivation by oxidation can be explained by an enhanced affinity of the oxidized enzyme toward G6P and NADP. The pH optimum of the reduced enzyme is more in the alkaline region (pH 9-9.5) as compared to that of the oxidized form (pH 8.0). The presence of 30 mM phosphate causes a shift of 0.5 to 1.0 pH unit into the alkaline region for both forms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Pflanzenphysiologie, Universit\u00e4t Bayreuth, Federal Republic of Germany."}], "LastName": "Scheibe", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Geissler", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fickenscher", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.49", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Darkness"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Protoplasts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2774577", "10.1016/0003-9861(89)90441-4", "0003-9861(89)90441-4"]}}]}
