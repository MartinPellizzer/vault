Micronuclei were scored on Feulgen/fast green-stained smear preparations of exfoliated cells obtained by scraping the surface of the buccal mucosa. All 17 raw betel nut eaters and all 20 chewers of betel quids had significantly elevated frequencies of micronucleated mucosa cells over nonchewing controls of comparable ethnic background and dietary habits. The frequencies of micronucleated exfoliated cells were higher at the site within the oral cavity where the quid was kept compared to those at the opposite buccal wall. The micronuclei frequency was lower among individuals chewing a raw betel nut, betel leaf and lime mixture compared to those using tobacco,-betel nut-, lime- and betel leaf-containing quids. Micronuclei frequencies in exfoliated human cells seem to represent a useful 'internal dosimeter' for estimating exposure to genotoxic, and by implication, carcinogenic agents in the tissue from which cancers will develop."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stich", "ForeName": "H F", "Initials": "HF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stich", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Parida", "ForeName": "B B", "Initials": "BB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7600053", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3835"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Staining and Labeling"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6187434", "10.1016/0304-3835(82)90024-6", "0304-3835(82)90024-6"]}}]}
