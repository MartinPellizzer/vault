The present study was undertaken to investigate the protective effect of a 43 kDa protein isolated from the herb Cajanus indicus, against acetaminophen-induced hepatic and renal toxicity. Male albino mice were treated with the protein for 4 days (intraperitoneally, 2 mg/kg body wt) prior or post to oral administration of acetaminophen (300 mg/kg body wt) for 2 days. Levels of different marker enzymes (namely, glutamate pyruvate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase), creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were measured in the experimental sera. Intracellular reactive oxygen species production and total antioxidant activity were also determined from acetaminophen and protein treated hepatocytes. Indices of different antioxidant enzymes (namely, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase) as well as lipid peroxidation end-products and glutathione were determined in both liver and kidney homogenates. In addition, Cytochrome P450 activity was also measured from liver microsomes. Finally, histopathological studies were performed from liver sections of control, acetaminophen-treated and protein pre- and post-treated (along with acetaminophen) mice. Administration of acetaminophen increased all the serum markers and creatinine levels in mice sera along with the enhancement of hepatic and renal lipid peroxidation. Besides, application of acetaminophen to hepatocytes increased reactive oxygen species production and reduced the total antioxidant activity of the treated hepatocytes. It also reduced the levels of antioxidant enzymes and cellular reserves of glutathione in liver and kidney. In addition, acetaminophen enhanced the cytochrome P450 activity of liver microsomes. Treatment with the protein significantly reversed these changes to almost normal. Apart from these, histopathological changes also revealed the protective nature of the protein against acetaminophen induced necrotic damage of the liver tissues. Results suggest that the protein protects hepatic and renal tissues against oxidative damages and could be used as an effective protector against acetaminophen induced hepato-nephrotoxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Bose Institute 93/1, Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road, Kolkata-700009, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghosh", "ForeName": "Ayantika", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sil", "ForeName": "Parames C", "Initials": "PC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "J Biochem Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9702084", "ISSNLinking": "1225-8687"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "362O9ITL9D", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetaminophen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Acetaminophen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cajanus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "injuries", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "injuries", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18047802", "10.5483/bmbrep.2007.40.6.1039"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
