In the light of this, herbal medicines are now also attracting attention as potential sources of cancer preventive agents. Using the inhibition of TNF-alpha release assay, we studied Acer nikoense (Megusurino-ki in Japanese), one of the herbal medicines. The inhibitory activity of TNF-alpha release was found in the leaf extract rather than the bark extract, and the main active constituents were identified as geraniin and corilagin, which are present in another Japanese traditional herb, Geranium thunbergii (Genno-shoko). The IC50 values of TNF-alpha release inhibition were 43 microM for geraniin and 76 microM for corilagin, whereas that for (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was 26 microM. Treatment with geraniin prior to application of okadaic acid, a tumor promoter on mouse skin initiated with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, reduced the percentage of tumor-bearing mice from 80.0 to 40.0% and the average numbers of tumor per mouse from 3.8 to 1.1 in week 20. Thus, geraniin has slightly weaker inhibitory activity than EGCG. Since geraniin and corilagin have been well investigated as representative tannins, we discuss here the new possibility of classical herbal medicine in the development of preventive agents for cancer and other life-style related diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Saitama Cancer Center, Kitaadachi-gun, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okabe", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suganuma", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Imayoshi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taniguchi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoshida", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fujiki", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-97-6", "NameOfSubstance": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60976-49-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Geraniin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "62LOS9TW6D", "NameOfSubstance": "corilagin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "3T3 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11642320", "10.1248/bpb.24.1145"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
