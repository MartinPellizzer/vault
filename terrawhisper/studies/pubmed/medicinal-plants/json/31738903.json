The vacuolar accumulation of secondary metabolites, also called specialized metabolites, plays important roles in environmental responses such as protecting against insect herbivores and attracting pollinators. The compartmentation of xenobiotics in the vacuole is also essential for adaptation to environmental stresses. These accumulations involve several transport systems, for which some responsible transporter proteins have been reported. Furthermore, studies on biosynthetic enzymes and transporters of secondary metabolites have revealed that vacuoles, which have been recognized for many years as a site for accumulation, also function as a site for biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and are thus actively involved in the entire biosynthetic process. In this review, we briefly summarize recent findings on vacuolar transporters involved in secondary metabolites and xenobiotics, and discuss their roles in plant adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses, through vacuolar dynamism."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
