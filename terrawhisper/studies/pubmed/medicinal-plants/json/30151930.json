It is attractive to develop a platform connecting the theoretical structural modelling and the results from experimental measurement. In addition, the separation and structural analysis of bioactive constituent isomers are still challenging tasks.", "Drift tube ion mobility (IM) mass spectrometry (MS) provides the experimental collision cross section (CCS) which contains the structural information. The experimental CCS can be compared with the calculated CCS of the molecular modelling structures. This technique is especially useful for bioactive constituents in herbal medicine because active isomers with the same chemical formula are common in these samples. IM helps separate and identify these isomers and reveals details about their structures and conformations.", "Two model bioactive constituents, caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs) and dicaffeoylquinic acids (di-CQAs), were selected to systematically investigate the influence of solution, ion source conditions and ion heating on the isomer CCS distributions. By comparing the calculated CCS with the experimental value, we identified the favorable conformations of CQAs. The most compact conformation of a CQA was less likely to isomerize than the more extended conformation. It was found that the isomerization tendency was in accord with the conformation favorability.", "This study offers an effective approach to predict and demystify the conformation and isomerization of the active constituents in herbal medicines."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, No. 818 Yunwan Road, Nanchang, 330002, China."}], "LastName": "Ouyang", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agilent Technologies, No. 3, Wang Jing Bei Lu, Beijing, 100102, China."}], "LastName": "Bo", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agilent Technologies, No. 3, Wang Jing Bei Lu, Beijing, 100102, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhengxiang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ming De Tian Sheng Biotech Inc., Changping Campus of Peking University, Beijing, 102200, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Xinqiu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, No. 818 Yunwan Road, Nanchang, 330002, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Mingzhen", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, No. 818 Yunwan Road, Nanchang, 330002, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Junmao", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, No. 818 Yunwan Road, Nanchang, 330002, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Innovative Drug and Efficient Energy-Saving Pharmaceutical Equipment, No. 56 Yangming Road, Nanchang, 330006, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Shilin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2917-179X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agilent Technologies, No. 3, Wang Jing Bei Lu, Beijing, 100102, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, No. 818 Yunwan Road, Nanchang, 330002, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Innovative Drug and Efficient Energy-Saving Pharmaceutical Equipment, No. 56 Yangming Road, Nanchang, 330006, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Yulin", "Initials": "Y"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2017\u2009M612159", "Agency": "China Postdoctoral Science Foundation", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "20165BCB19009", "Agency": "Jiangxi Province 5511 innovative Talent Project", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2017KY07", "Agency": "Jiangxi Province Postdoctoral Science Foundation", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "[2016]173", "Agency": "Nanchang innovative talent team", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "81760702", "Agency": "Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "81560636", "Agency": "Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "8802365", "ISSNLinking": "0951-4198"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "caffeoylquinic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "058C04BGYI", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isomerism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Quinic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30151930", "10.1002/rcm.8271"]}}]}
