However, the evolution and structure of the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) in A. argyi remain unclear. In this study, the mitogenome of A. argyi was assembled and characterized for the first time.", "The mitogenome of A. argyi was a circular molecule of 229,354\u00a0bp. It encodes 56 genes, including 33 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 20 tRNA genes, and three rRNA genes, and three pseudogenes. Five trans-spliced introns were observed in three PCGs namely, nad1, nad2 and nad5. Repeat analysis identified 65 SSRs, 14 tandem repeats, and 167 dispersed repeats. The A. argyi mitogenome contains 12 plastid transfer sequences from 79\u00a0bp to 2552\u00a0bp. Five conserved MTPTs were identified in all 18 Asteraceae species. Comparison of mitogenome between A. argyi and one Artemisia specie and two Chrysanthemum species showed 14 conserved gene clusters. Phylogenetic analysis with organelle genomes of A. argyi and 18 other Anthemideae plants showed inconsistent phylogenetic trees, which implied that the evolutionary rates of PCGs and rrna genes derived from mitochondrion and plastid were incongruent. The Ka/Ks ratio of the 27 shared protein-coding genes in the 18 Anthemideae species are all less than 1 indicating that these genes were under the effect of purifying selection. Lastly, a total of 568 RNA editing sites in PCGs were further identified. The average editing frequency of non-synonymous changes was significantly higher than that of synonymous changes (one-sample Student's t-test, p-values\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) in three tissues (root, leaf and stem).", "In this study, the gene content, genome size, genome comparison, mitochondrial plastid sequences, dN/dS analysis of mitochondrial protein-coding genes, and RNA-editing events in A. argyi mitogenome were determined, providing insights into the phylogenetic relationships of Asteraceae plant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
