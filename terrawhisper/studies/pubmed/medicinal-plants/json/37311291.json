There has been a considerable interest in exploring the factors affecting elicitation mechanism and nanomaterials have been emerged as strong elicitors in medicinal plants. Stevia rebaudiana is well-known bio-sweetener and the presence of zero calorie, steviol glycosides (SGs) in the leaves of S. rebaudiana have made it a desirable crop to be cultivated on large scale to obtain its higher yield and maximal content of high quality natural sweeteners. Besides, phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidants are abundant in stevia which contribute to its medicinal importance. Currently, scientists are trying to increase the market value of stevia by the enhancement in production of its bioactive compounds. As such, various in vitro and cell culture strategies have been adopted. In stevia agronanotechnology, nanoparticles behave as elicitors for the triggering of its secondary metabolites, specifically rebaudioside A. This review article discusses the importance of S. rebaudiana and SGs, conventional approaches that have failed to increase the desired yield and quality of stevia, modern approaches that are currently being applied to obtain utmost benefits of SGs, and future needs of advanced technologies for further exploitation of this wonder of nature."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
