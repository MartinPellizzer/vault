Several medicinal plants possess curative and protective effect against thrombocytopenia associated with diseases or drugs.", "In the present study, we have investigated the platelet augmentation activity of polyherbal formulation (VITA PLAT Capsule) in cyclophosphamide-induced thrombocytopenic rat model.", "Twenty-four albino Wistar rats were divided into four groups. Thrombocytopenia was induced in the rats by administering cyclophosphamide (25 mg/kg, i.p.) for three days to all the groups except normal controls. The test groups were given orally a polyherbal formulation suspended in normal saline for 14 days. Blood was withdrawn from the retro-orbital plexus of the rats on days 1, 7, and 14 of study to determine platelet counts in all groups. Clotting time and bleeding time were determined on the last day of study. Data were collected and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.", "The results showed that the polyherbal formulation treatment could significantly ameliorate platelet count in thrombocyto-penic rats in the initial as well as in the later phase. The total WBC count was also improved during later phase in test groups. However, there is no significant difference between clotting time and bleeding time in all groups.", "Our study suggests a potential role of this formulation in the augmentation of platelet counts in various thrombocyto-penic disorders including a role in ameliorating the haemorrhagic complications of dengue fever."], "CopyrightInformation": "This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY 4.0), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6221-6662"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bhagwan Mahavir College of Pharmacy, Surat, India."}], "LastName": "Sailor", "ForeName": "Girish", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Vital Care Pvt Ltd, Vadodara, India."}], "LastName": "Hirani", "ForeName": "Komal", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4614-9797"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sumandeep Vidyapeeth, Vadodara, India."}], "LastName": "Parmar", "ForeName": "Ghanshyam", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sumandeep Vidyapeeth, Vadodara, India."}], "LastName": "Maheshwari", "ForeName": "Rajesh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sumandeep Vidyapeeth, Vadodara, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Rupa", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sumandeep Vidyapeeth, Vadodara, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar Seth", "ForeName": "Avinash", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Bulgaria", "MedlineTA": "Folia Med (Plovdiv)", "NlmUniqueID": "2984761R", "ISSNLinking": "0204-8043"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8N3DW7272P", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclophosphamide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Platelets"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclophosphamide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Thrombocytopenia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "28"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33650398", "10.3897/folmed.63.e49167"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
