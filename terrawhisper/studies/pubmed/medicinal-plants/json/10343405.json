Low nitrogen nutrition reduces chlorophyll and soluble protein contents in the leaves and thus the photosynthesis rate and dry-matter accumulation. Chlorophyll, soluble protein and Rubisco contents and photosynthesis rate are not significantly altered by ambient levels of UV-B radiation (17 microW m-2, 290-320 nm, 4 h/day for one week). Comparative studies show that under high nitrogen, UV-B radiation slightly enhances leaf expansion and dry-matter accumulation in cultivar Pinto, but inhibits these parameters in Vilmorin. These results suggest that the UV-B effect on growth is mediated through leaf expansion, which is particularly sensitive to UV-B, and that Pinto is more tolerant than Vilmorin. The effect of UV-B radiation on UV-B-absorbing compounds and on NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) activity is also examined. Both UV-B radiation and low-nitrogen nutrition enhance the content of UV-B-absorbing compounds, and among the three cultivars used, Pinto exhibits the highest increases and Arroz the lowest. The same trend is observed for the specific activity and content of NADP-ME. On a leaf-area basis, the amount of UV-B-absorbing compounds is highly correlated with the enzyme activity (r2 = 0.83), suggesting that NADP-ME plays a key role in biosynthesis of these compounds. Furthermore, the higher sensitivity of Vilmorin than Pinto to UV-B radiation appears to be related to the activity of NADP-ME and the capacity of the plants to accumulate UV-B-absorbing compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias y Forestales, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile. manpinto@abello.dic.uchile.cl"}], "LastName": "Pinto", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Casati", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hsu", "ForeName": "T P", "Initials": "TP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ku", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Edwards", "ForeName": "G E", "Initials": "GE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "J Photochem Photobiol B", "NlmUniqueID": "8804966", "ISSNLinking": "1011-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.37", "NameOfSubstance": "Malate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.40", "NameOfSubstance": "malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating) (NADP+)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "growth & development", "physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Malate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10343405", "10.1016/s1011-1344(99)00031-7", "S1011-1344(99)00031-7"]}}]}
