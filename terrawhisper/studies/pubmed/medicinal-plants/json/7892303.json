In January (short days), two groups (3 each) of these ewes received one or two 17 beta-estradiol sc implants. In May (long days), one of two new groups (4 each) of these ewes was reexposed to phytoestrogens for another 14 days while the other served as a control. Physical examination of ewes for changes in reproductive organs was carried out two or three times per week during each feeding/treatment, and continued until observed changes disappeared. Clinically significant changes occurred in the reproductive organs of ewes fed red clover. Vulva color changed from pale to pink and red, and there were enlargements of the vulva, uterus, and udder. In addition, teat length and circumference increased, and secretion of milky fluid began. These changes were similar, but more pronounced during treatment with 17 beta-estradiol, particularly teat circumference. The changes in vulva were more dramatic in May than in November and resembled those observed in ewes treated with estradiol. Our data show that a daily intake of 3.5 g formononetin for 14 days caused the increase of teat size and changes in the color of the vulva and in uterus weight in ovariectomized ewes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala."}], "LastName": "Nwannenna", "ForeName": "A I", "Initials": "AI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lundh", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Madej", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fredriksson", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bj\u00f6rnhag", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Proc Soc Exp Biol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7505892", "ISSNLinking": "0037-9727"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Implants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogens, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoflavones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytoestrogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "295DQC67BJ", "NameOfSubstance": "formononetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4G7DS2Q64Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Progesterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4TI98Z838E", "NameOfSubstance": "Estradiol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Implants"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Estradiol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Estrogens, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Genitalia, Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Isoflavones"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Ovariectomy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytoestrogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Progesterone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silage"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7892303", "10.3181/00379727-208-43838"]}}]}
