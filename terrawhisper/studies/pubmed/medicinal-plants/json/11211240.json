Although T.S. extract increased ERDM activity in induced rat liver microsomes, it showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect in vitro on other P450 monooxygenase activities particularly EROD and PROD, which are mediated primarily by CYP1A1 and CYP2B1/2, respectively. PROD, EROD and MROD activities were also decreased by 18%, 19% and 40%, respectively, in hepatic microsomes prepared from rats treated with T.S. extract for 3 days. Kinetic analysis of CYP activity of 3-methylchloranthrene-induced microsomes demonstrated that T.S. inhibited EROD and MROD activities by a noncompetitive and competitive mechanism, respectively. The analysis of alterations produced by T.S. on PROD kinetic parameters in phenobarbital-induced microsomes suggested that the inhibition is noncompetitive. Pretreatment of rats with T.S. prolonged pentobarbital and phenobarbital sleeping time; however, plasma phenobarbital concentration determined on awakening showed no significant difference between control and T.S.-treated rats. T.S. was also found to be a potent inhibitor of the liver cytosolic glutathione S-transferase. These data suggest that selective modulation of CYP isoenzymes by T.S. might contribute to protection of the liver from xenobiotic-induced intoxication or to alteration of the action of drug(s) concomitantly administered besides its antioxidative properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Physiology and Pharmacology, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gyamfi", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hokama", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oppong-Boachie", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aniya", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hum Exp Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "9004560", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YQE403BP4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenobarbital"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ghana"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenobarbital"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11211240", "10.1191/096032700667732543"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
