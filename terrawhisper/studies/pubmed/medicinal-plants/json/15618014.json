Several natural products have been shown to accelerate the healing process. The present investigation was undertaken to determine the efficacy of topical administration of an alcoholic bark extract of Butea monosperma (B. monosperma) on cutaneous wound healing in rats. Full-thickness excision wounds were made on the back of rat and B. monosperma extract was administered topically. The granulation tissue formed on days 4, 8, 12 and 16 (post-wound) was used to estimate total collagen, hexosamine, protein, DNA and uronic acid. The extract increased cellular proliferation and collagen synthesis at the wound site, as evidenced by increase in DNA, total protein and total collagen content of granulation tissues. The extract treated wounds were found to heal much faster as indicated by improved rates of epithelialization and wound contraction, also confirmed by histopathological examinations. Also, the tensile strength of drug-treated wounds was increased significantly. In addition, we show that B. monosperma possesses antioxidant properties, by its ability to reduce lipid peroxidation. The results clearly substantiate the beneficial effects of the topical application of B. monosperma in the acceleration of wound healing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Central Leather Research Institute, Adyar, Chennai 600020, Tamilnadu, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sumitra", "ForeName": "Miriyala", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manikandan", "ForeName": "Panchatcharam", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suguna", "ForeName": "Lochin", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Int J Biochem Cell Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9508482", "ISSNLinking": "1357-2725"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexosamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Uronic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Topical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Butea"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Granulation Tissue"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hexosamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Bark"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["injuries", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tensile Strength"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Uronic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15618014", "10.1016/j.biocel.2004.08.003", "S1357-2725(04)00314-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
