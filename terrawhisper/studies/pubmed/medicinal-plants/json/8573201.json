It also inhibited Mg(2+)-ATPase, H+,K(+)-ATPase, H(+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase activities, but less potently. No effects on alkaline and acid phosphatase activities were observed. The inhibition of Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity by atractylon was noncompetitive with respect to ATP and was greater with increasing K+ concentration, whereas it was not affected by Na+ concentration. The activity of K(+)-dependent p-nitrophenyl phosphatase, a partial reaction of Na+,K(+)-ATPase, was inhibited noncompetitively with respect to substrate (I50 value of 1.8 x 10(-5) M), and the inhibition rate was independent of the K+ concentration. Furthermore, atractylon increased the Ki value for Na+ from 130 to 190 mM, but did not alter the Ki value for ATP. Inhibition of the phosphoenzyme formation by atractylon was greater at 0.1 M than at 1 M NaCl. K(+)-dependent dephosphorylation (E2-P to K.E2) was inhibited by atractylon, whereas ADP-sensitive (Na.E1-P to Na.E1) and non-specific dephosphorylation steps were not affected. These results suggest that atractylon, a specific inhibitor of Na+,K(+)-ATPase, interacts with enzyme in the E2 state and inhibits the reaction step from E2-P to K.E2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology, Tokyo Metropolitan Research Laboratory of Public Health, Japan."}], "LastName": "Satoh", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nagai", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ushiyama", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kano", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0101032", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2952"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "451W47IQ8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "660YQ98I10", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6989-21-5", "NameOfSubstance": "atractylon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.41", "NameOfSubstance": "4-Nitrophenylphosphatase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 7.2.2.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "4-Nitrophenylphosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Horses"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8573201", "10.1016/0006-2952(95)02188-4", "0006295295021884"]}}]}
