Due to underreporting, analysis, and identification issues, clinically evaluated medication hepatotoxicity is prevalent yet hard to quantify.", "This review's primary objective is to thoroughly compare pharmaceutical drugs and herbal compounds that have undergone clinical trials, focusing on their metabolic mechanisms contributing to the onset of liver illnesses and their hepatoprotective effects.", "The data was gathered from several online sources, such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science, using appropriate keywords.", "The prevalence of conventional and herbal medicine is rising. A comprehensive understanding of the metabolic mechanism is necessary to mitigate the hepatotoxicity induced by drugs and facilitate the incorporation or substitution of herbal medicine instead of pharmaceuticals. Moreover, pre-clinical pharmacological research has the potential to facilitate the development of natural products as therapeutic agents, displaying promising possibilities for their eventual clinical implementation.", "Acetaminophen, isoniazid, rifampicin, diclofenac, and pyrogallol have been identified as the most often reported synthetic drugs that produce hepatotoxicity by oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis during the last several decades. Due to their ability to downregulate many factors (such as cytokines) and activate several enzyme/enzyme systems, herbal substances (such as Gingko biloba extract, curcumin, resveratrol, and silymarin) provide superior protection against harmful mechanisms which induce hepatotoxicity with fewer adverse effects than their synthetic counterparts."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier GmbH.
