Group 1 steers were pastured on fescue-clover and slaughtered in the spring at approximately 540 d of age. Group 2 steers were pastured on fescue-clover then placed on summer pasture regimens and slaughtered at approximately 620 d of age. Group 3 steers were treated the same as Group 2 then placed in the drylot for 45 d. Group 4 steers were treated the same as Group 2 steers then placed in the drylot for 75 d. Group 5 steers were placed in drylot after weaning and conditioning and were slaughtered at endpoints that corresponded with those for Group 3. Steers selected for slaughter at each endpoint were those evaluated to have reached the most optimum slaughter weight and finish by project personnel. Carcasses of steers from fescue-clover and summer pasture had lower yield grades and a lower quality grade than carcasses of steers from drylot (P < .05). Carcasses of steers from fescue-clover and summer pasture had a more yellow fat covering than carcasses of steers that received a concentrate (Treatments 3, 4, and 5, P < .0001). Fescue-clover- and summer pasture-fed steers had a higher percentage of lean and a lower percentage of fat in the 9-10-11th rib section than did steers that received concentrate (P < .005). Chemical analysis of the lean tissue of the 9-10-11th rib section indicated that summer pasture-fed steers had a lower percentage of ether extract and higher percentage of moisture than the lean tissue from steers that received concentrate (P < .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Animal, Dairy and Veterinary Sciences Department, Clemson University, SC 29634-0361."}], "LastName": "Schaake", "ForeName": "S L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Skelley", "ForeName": "G C", "Initials": "GC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Halpin", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grimes", "ForeName": "L W", "Initials": "LW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cross", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thompson", "ForeName": "C E", "Initials": "CE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Anim Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8003002", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8812"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Adipose Tissue"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Meat"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Development"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8294270", "10.2527/1993.71123199x"]}}]}
