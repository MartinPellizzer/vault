Greenhouse plants were exposed to UV-A for 1, 2, and 4\u2009h daily, 40\u2009days. Based on the results, UV-A radiation had no significant effect on agro-morphological traits, while it remarkably altered chlorophyll content, total phenolic and flavonoid contents, as well as radical scavenging activity. Plants exposed to UV-A (4h) had the highest total phenolic and flavonoid contents, antioxidant activity, as well as the content of rosmarinic, carnosic, vanillic, and caffeic acids, and naringin. Conversely, carnosol, cirsimaritin, and hispulin levels decreased in treated plants. Overall, UV-A radiation had a positive effect on the medicinal aspects of <i>R. officinalis</i> L., which is important in the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, it is suggested application of UV-A emitting LEDs for commercial purposes, with a lower risk level than UV-B and UV-C."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Bu Ali Sina University, Hamedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rahimi-Rizi", "ForeName": "Marziye", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4089-7735"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Bu Ali Sina University, Hamedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Azizi", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Bu Ali Sina University, Hamedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sarikhani", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural and Natural Resources Research Center, Hamedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kheiri", "ForeName": "Homayon", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "41"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37876221", "10.1080/14786419.2023.2273921"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
