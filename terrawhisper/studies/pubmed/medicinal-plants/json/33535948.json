Among them, secoisolariciresinol diglucosides (SDG) are the major bioactive compounds of L. usitatissimum with prospective pharmacological accomplishments. Pure compounds and crude extracts isolated from L. usitatissimum exhibited significant anti-cancer, antioxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, antidiabetic, anti-diarrheal, anti-malarial, hepato-protective, reno-protective, immunosuppressive, antiarrhythmic, and cognitive effects. Studies indicated that the toxicological effect from the consumption of flaxseed is because of its cyanogenic glycosides, linatine, and cadmium, but the level does not seem to be adequately concentrated to contribute to any physiological impact.", "Further studies are expected to comprehend the detailed mode of action of its dynamic constituents as potent therapeutics and to completely reveal its preventive and healing potentials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology & Genetic Engineering, Noakhali Science & Technology University, Noakhali, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Akter", "ForeName": "Yeasmin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Modeling Drug-Design and Discovery Laboratory, Pharmacology Research Division, BCSIR Laboratories Chattogram, Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Chattogram, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Junaid", "ForeName": "Md", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Chittagong, Chattogram, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Afrose", "ForeName": "Syeda Samira", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Science and Technology Chittagong, Chattogram, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Nahrin", "ForeName": "Afsana", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Modeling Drug-Design and Discovery Laboratory, Pharmacology Research Division, BCSIR Laboratories Chattogram, Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Chattogram, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Alam", "ForeName": "Muhammad Shaiful", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Modeling Drug-Design and Discovery Laboratory, Pharmacology Research Division, BCSIR Laboratories Chattogram, Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Chattogram, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Sharmin", "ForeName": "Tania", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Modeling Drug-Design and Discovery Laboratory, Pharmacology Research Division, BCSIR Laboratories Chattogram, Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Chattogram, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Akter", "ForeName": "Rasheda", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Modeling Drug-Design and Discovery Laboratory, Pharmacology Research Division, BCSIR Laboratories Chattogram, Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Chattogram, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Hosen", "ForeName": "S M Zahid", "Initials": "SMZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mini Rev Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101094212", "ISSNLinking": "1389-5575"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33535948", "10.2174/1389557521666210203153436", "MRMC-EPUB-113917"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
