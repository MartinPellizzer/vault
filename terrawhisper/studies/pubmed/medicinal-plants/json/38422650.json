Recent studies have shown that the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) is involved in the pathophysiology of depression. Previous studies have found that Kaji-ichigoside F1 (KF1) has a protective effect against NMDA-induced neurotoxicity. However, the antidepressant mechanism of KF1 has not been confirmed yet.", "In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the rapid antidepressant activity of KF1 and explore the underlying mechanism.", "First, we explored the effect of KF1 on NMDA-induced hippocampal neurons and the underlying mechanism. Second, depression was induced in C57BL/6 mice via chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), and the immediate and persistent depression-like behavior was evaluated using the forced swimming test (FST) after a single administration of KF1. Third, the contributions of NMDA signaling to the antidepressant effect of KF1 were investigated using pharmacological interventions. Fourth, CUMS mice were treated with KF1 for 21 days, and then their depression-like behaviors and the underlying mechanism were further explored.", "The FST was used to evaluate immediate and persistent depression-like behavior after a single administration of KF1 with or without NMDA pretreatment. The effect of KF1 on depressive-like behavior was investigated in CUMS mice by treating them with KF1 once daily for 21 days through the sucrose preference test, FST, open field test, and tail suspension test. Then, the effects of KF1 on the morphology and molecular and functional phenotypes of primary neuronal cells and hippocampus of mice were investigated by hematoxylin-eosin staining, Nissl staining, propidium iodide staining, TUNEL staining, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, JC-1 staining, ELISA, immunofluorescence analysis, RT-PCR, and Western blot.", "KF1 could effectively improve cellular viability, reduce apoptosis, inhibit the release of LDH and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and increase the mitochondrial membrane potential and the number of dendritic spines numbers in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, behavioral tests showed that KF1 exerted acute and sustained antidepressant-like effects by reducing Glu-levels and ameliorating neuronal damage in the hippocampus. Additionally, in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that PSD95, Syn1, \u03b1-amino-3\u2011hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were upregulated at the protein level, and BDNF and AMPA were upregulated at the mRNA level. NR1 and NR2A showed the opposite trend.", "These results confirm that KF1 exerts rapid antidepressant effects mainly by activating the AMPA-BDNF-mTOR pathway and inhibiting the NMDAR-CaMKII\u03b1 pathway. This study serves as a new reference for discovering rapid antidepressants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier GmbH.
