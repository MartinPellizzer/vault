Additionally, it has the ability to generate non-toxic herbicides and antimicrobial medications. The extraction from plants has proven to be the main route of production of SA with economic benefits and environmental efficiency. Therefore, it is necessary to perform purification of SA from these herbal medicines before quantifying it. In this study, researchers employed a boronate affinity-based controlled oriented surface imprinting technique to produce molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as highly effective solid phase extraction (SPE) adsorbents for the isolation and purification of SA. 3-Fluoro-4-formylphenylboronic acid functionalized silica nanoparticles were used as supporting materials for immobilizing SA. Poly(2-anilinoethanol) with a higher hydrophilic domain can be used as an effective imprinting coating. The prepared SA-imprinted silica nanoparticles exhibited several significant results, such as good specificity, high binding capacity (39.06 \u00b1 2.24 mg g<sup>-1</sup>), moderate binding constant (6.61 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>), fast kinetics (8 min) and low binding pH (pH 5.0) toward SA. The replication of SA-imprinted silica nanoparticles was deemed satisfactory. The SA-imprinted silica nanoparticles could be still reused after seven adsorption-desorption cycles, which indicated high chemical stability. In addition, the recoveries of the proposed method for SA at three spiked level analysis in star aniseed and meadow cranesbill were 96.2% to 109.0% and 91.6% to 103.5%, respectively. The SA-imprinted silica nanoparticles that have been prepared are capable of identifying the target SA in real herbal medicines. Our approach makes sample pre-preparation simple, fast, selective and efficient."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Henan Key Laboratory of Function-Oriented Porous Materials, Luoyang Normal University, Luoyang 471934, PR China. lidaojin7910@126.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yumin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7353-5060"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Henan Key Laboratory of Function-Oriented Porous Materials, Luoyang Normal University, Luoyang 471934, PR China. lidaojin7910@126.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Daojin", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Henan Key Laboratory of Function-Oriented Porous Materials, Luoyang Normal University, Luoyang 471934, PR China. lidaojin7910@126.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Bingqian", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Anal Methods", "NlmUniqueID": "101519733", "ISSNLinking": "1759-9660"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "29MS2WI2NU", "NameOfSubstance": "Shikimic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Boronic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Molecularly Imprinted Polymers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Imprinting"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Shikimic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Boronic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Solid Phase Extraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Molecularly Imprinted Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "25"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38639924", "10.1039/d4ay00219a"]}}]}
