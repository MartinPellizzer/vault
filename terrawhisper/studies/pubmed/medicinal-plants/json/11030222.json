Results show that both the leaf and stem-bark extracts significantly increased the activities of serum and liver alkaline phosphatase, liver acid phosphatase, liver and kidney glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase and glycogen in the treated rats. While the stem-bark extract significantly elevated the activities of fructose-1,6-diphosphatase and glycogen in the kidney, these biochemical parameters were not affected by treatment with the leaf extract. The activity of serum acid phosphatase was unaffected by the two extracts. The results obtained clearly show that these extracts caused a marked increase in gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidney of the treated rats. While the stem-bark extract increased gluconeogenesis in both liver and kidney, the leaf extract caused an increase in gluconeogenesis only in the liver. The increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity caused by these extracts may, aside from having other tissues contributing to it, be due to damage caused by these extracts to the hepatocytes. The extent of pathological changes as well as the implications of these findings to folklore medicine requires further investigation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Obafemi Awolowo College of Health Sciences, Ogun State University, Ago-Iwoye, Nigeria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olagunju", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oladunni", "ForeName": "S O", "Initials": "SO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oladimeji", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cytobios", "NlmUniqueID": "0207227", "ISSNLinking": "0011-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11030222"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
