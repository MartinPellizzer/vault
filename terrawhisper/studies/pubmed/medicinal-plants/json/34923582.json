They are an important class of natural products combined by a flavonoid unit and a phenylpropanoid unit.", "From the literature survey, 88 constituents from natural resources were identified. Different derivatives of flavonolignans were listed, fused phenylpropanoid unit with dioxane ring, or cyclic ether, or simple ether side chain, or lactone, and so on. Besides, the pharmacological effects of flavonolignans were summarized as well. It has a wide range of anti-tumour, antioxidant, anti-microorganic and anti-inflammatory effects.", "This review had provided a full-scale profile of flavonolignans on its plant sources, phytochemistry and pharmacology, and also proposed some issues and perspectives which may be of concern in the future. It was greatly anticipated that the commercialization of the flavonolignans would lead to uplift the financial abilities of communities attending the growing of the flavonolignans and the relevant and potential production becoming an international herbal and pharmaceutical commodity."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.
