Although it was found to inhibit the neuraminidase of IAV, it may also perturb other cellular functions, as polyphenolic acids have shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and other activities.", "This study aimed to investigate the effect of 3,4,5-TCQA at a cell level, which is critical for protecting host cell from IAV infection.", "We explored the effect of 3,4,5-TCQA on H292 cells infected or un-infected with Pr8 IAV. The major genes and related pathway were identified through RNA sequencing. The pathway was confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using nitric oxide measurement assay.", "We showed that 3,4,5-TCQA downregulated the immune response in H292 cells, and reduced the cytokine production in Pr8-infected cells, through Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. In addition, 3,4,5-TCQA showed anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells.", "Collectively, our results indicated that 3,4,5-TCQA suppressed inflammation caused by IAV infection through TLR3/7 signaling pathway.
