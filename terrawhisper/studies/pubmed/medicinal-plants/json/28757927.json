They were assigned into two parallel therapeutic groups, including the intervention group (lactulose plus traditional Persian medicine [TPM] advices) and control group (only lactulose) through a block randomization. Weekly follow-up was done for 1 month for both groups.", "After the intervention, the frequency of bowel habit increased significantly in patients of both groups (<i>P</i> = 0.001), and the frequency of hard stool defecation, sensation of painful defecation, sensation of incomplete evacuation, sensation of anorectal obstruction, and manual maneuver for evacuation were decreased significantly in patients of both groups (<i>P</i> < 0.001 for all comparisons and 0.025 for manual maneuver). However, the only significant difference between the two groups was more reduction in the sensation of painful defecation in the lactulose group versus lactulose plus TPM advices (<i>P</i> = 0.014).", "Based on the pilot study, no significant difference was shown between TPM with lactulose and lactulose only in the management of chronic functional constipation.
