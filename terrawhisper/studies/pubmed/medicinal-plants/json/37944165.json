Prenyllongnols A-D (<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>), four undescribed prenylated acylphloroglucinols, were isolated from <i>Hypericum longistylum</i>. Compounds <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> exhibited remarkable immunosuppressive activities in murine splenocyte proliferation under the induction of concanavalin A (Con A), and IC<sub>50</sub> values ranged from 2.98 \u00b1 0.21 to 6.34 \u00b1 0.72 \u03bcM. Furthermore, in a Con A-challenged autoimmune hepatitis mouse model, the mice in the group that were pretreated with isolate <b>2</b> significantly ameliorated liver injury and decreased proinflammatory cytokine production. Notably, natural product <b>2</b> was the first prenylated acylphloroglucinol to protect against concanavalin A-induced autoimmune hepatitis. This finding underscores the potential of prenylated acylphloroglucinol-type metabolites as promising candidates for designing novel immunosuppressors in the quest for new antiautoimmune hepatitis drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, Tongji Medical College,
