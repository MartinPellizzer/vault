Chronic fatigue can lead to cardiovascular dysfunction, mental disorders and other serious pathological reactions. Therefore, how to relieve fatigue accurately and effectively is an important proposition to implement the concept of &quot;Healthy China&quot; in the new era. As an important part of Chinese medicine health industry, Chinese medicine health food has been developing rapidly in recent years. At present, there are 1 157 kinds of anti-fatigue health food on the market in China, most of which are single Chinese medicine and its compound. However, their functions are generally labeled as &quot;anti-fatigue&quot;, and their function positioning is too extensive and unclear. With the deepened understanding of fatigue classification and its physiological and pathological basis, it is urgent to be combined with the progress of modern chemical and pharmacological stu-dies to differentiate and precisely position the anti-fatigue health effects of traditional Chinese medicine. For this purpose, the classifications of fatigue were summarized in this paper, and the mechanism of fatigue was explained from the aspects of energy metabolism, accumulation of metabolites, oxidative stress, inflammation, hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis and so on. We selected 10 traditional Chinese medicines which are most frequently used in health food, analyzed their anti-fatigue effect mechanisms, and summarized the best types of anti-fatigue food, so as to promote the scientific development of anti-fatigue health food industry, expand the market application scope of anti-fatigue health food, better respond to the construction of a healthy China and serve for people's health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Characteristic Chinese Medicine Resources in Southwest China, College of Pharmacy,Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Le-le", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Laboratory, Teaching Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Jun-Zhi", "Initials": "JZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Sanajon Pharmaceutical Group Chengdu 610000, China Sichuan Key Laboratory of Dairy Nutrition and Function Chengdu 610045, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hai-Yan", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Characteristic Chinese Medicine Resources in Southwest China, College of Pharmacy,Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hui-Min", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Characteristic Chinese Medicine Resources in Southwest China, College of Pharmacy,Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Characteristic Chinese Medicine Resources in Southwest China, College of Pharmacy,Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Characteristic Chinese Medicine Resources in Southwest China, College of Pharmacy,Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Run-Chun", "Initials": "RC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Characteristic Chinese Medicine Resources in Southwest China, College of Pharmacy,Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ding-Kun", "Initials": "DK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "3"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32893550", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200113.403"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
