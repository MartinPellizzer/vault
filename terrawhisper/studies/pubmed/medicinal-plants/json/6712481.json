The following items were tested: --isolated horse bean protein --hydrolysed isolated horse bean protein with an amino acid supplement to make up for losses due to hydrolysis --horse bean protein-casein (1:1) fibres --isolated horse bean protein with an amino acid supplement to achieve the same amino acid concentrations as in the horse bean protein-casein fibres. The lowest digestibility and utilisation values were ascertained for the hydrolysed protein. Endogenous N-excretion calculated according to the isotope dilution method was higher than for intact proteins, the transport of the chyme in the digestive tract and the true absorption of N in the small intestine had significantly diminished. In comparison with horse bean protein supplemented with amino acids, the horse bean protein-casein fibres showed decreased protein utilisation and increased endogenous N-excretion. Independent of the protein fed and of the time after feeding a relatively constant endogenous N-quota of approximately 70% could be ascertained in the chyme in the small intestine. In contrast to this, the relation between exogenous and endogenous N determined from the contents of the large intestine proved to be dependent on the intermediary utilisation of the protein fed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "K\u00f6hler", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pahle", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gebhardt", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Resorption und Verwertung unterschiedlich strukturierter Proteinisolate bei Ratten."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Arch Tierernahr", "NlmUniqueID": "0217641", "ISSNLinking": "0003-942X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caseins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Hydrolysates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caseins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food, Fortified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Hydrolysates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6712481", "10.1080/17450398409426935"]}}]}
