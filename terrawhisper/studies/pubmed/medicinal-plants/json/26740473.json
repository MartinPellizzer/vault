Since obesity is a potential risk factor in the development of hypertension, type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, infertility, etc., it is no more viewed as a cosmetic issue. Currently, only a few FDA-approved anti-obesity drugs like Orlistat, Lorcaserin and Phentermine-topiramate are available in the market, but they have considerable side effects. On the other hand, bariatric surgery as an alternative is associated with high risk and expensive. In view of these there is a growing trend towards natural product-based drug intervention as one of the crucial strategies for management of obesity and related ailments. In Asian traditional medicine and Ayurvedic literature a good number of plant species have been used and quoted for possible lipid-lowering and anti-obesity effects; however, many of them have not been evaluated rigorously for a definite recommendation and also lack adequate scientific validation. This review explores and updates on various plant species, their used parts, bioactive components and focuses multiple targets/pathways to contain obesity which may pave the way to develop novel and effective drugs. We also summarised different drugs in use to treat obesity and their current status. Nature is future promise of our wellbeing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
