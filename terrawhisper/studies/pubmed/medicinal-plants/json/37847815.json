The data on key medicinal plants and their therapeutic efficacy against various ailments are quite scattered and not available on a single platform. Moreover, currently there is no means/mechanism of finding the best medicinal plant(s) from numerous plants known to cure any disease. DISPEL (Diseases Plants Eliminate) is a compendium of medicinal plants available across the world that are used to cure infectious as well as non-infectious diseases in humans. The association of a medicinal plant with a disease it cures is hereby referred to as 'medicinal plant-disease cured' linkage. The DISPEL database hosts \u223c60\u2009000 'medicinal plant-disease cured' linkages encompassing \u223c5500 medicinal plants and \u223c1000 diseases. This platform provides interactive and detailed visualization of medicinal plants, diseases and their relations using comprehensible network graph representation. The user has the freedom to search the database by specifying the name of disease(s) as well as the scientific/common name(s) of plant. Each 'medicinal plant-disease cured' relation is scored based on the availability of any medicine/product derived from that medicinal plant, information about active compound(s), knowledge regarding the part of plant that is effective and number of distinct articles/books/websites confirming the effectiveness of the medicinal plant. The user can find the best plant(s) that can be used to cure any desired disease(s). The DISPEL database is the first step towards generating the 'most-effective' combination of plants to cure a disease since it delineates as well as ranks all the therapeutic medicinal plants for that disease. The combination of best medicinal plants can then be used to conduct clinical trials and thus pave the way for their use in clinics for treatment of diseases.
