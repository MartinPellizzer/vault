Wolf (P. cocos) has been widely used as medical plant in East Asia with remarkable anti-Alzheimer's disease (anti-AD) activity. However, the underlying mechanisms are still confused. In this study, based on the \u03b2-Amyloid deposition hypothesis of AD, an integrated analysis was conducted to screen and separation 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitors from triterpenoids of P. cocos and investigate the anti-AD mechanisms, containing bioaffinity ultrafiltration UPLC-Q-Exactive, molecular docking, and multiple complex networks. Five triterpenoids were identified as potential 5-LOX inhibitors, including Tumulosic acid, Polyporenic acid C, 3-Epi-dehydrotumulosic acid, Pachymic acid and Dehydrotrametenolic acid. Five potential 5-LOX inhibitors were screened by ultrafiltration affinity assay in P. cocos. The molecular docking simulation results are consistent with the ultrafiltration experimental results, which further verifies the accuracy of the experiment. The commercial 5-LOX inhibitor that Zileuton was used as a positive control to evaluate the inhibitory effect of active ingredients on 5-LOX. Subsequently, the established separation method allowed the five active ingredients (Pachymic acid, 3-Epi-dehydrotumulosic acid, Dehydrotrametenolic acid, Tumulosic acid and Polyporenic acid C) with high purity to be isolated. Targeting network pharmacology analysis showed that five active ingredients correspond to a total of 286 targets. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis found that target cells were mainly enriched in Pathways in cancer, Lipid and atherosclerosis. Our results indicate that P. cocos extract has the potential to be used in the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. This will help elucidate the mechanisms of action of various medicinal plants at the molecular level and provide more opportunities for the discovery and development of new potential treatments from health food resources."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
