Phillygenin (PHI) is a natural lignan derived primarily from Forsythia suspensa with hepatoprotective pharmacological and medicinal properties. This research aimed to investigate the preventive effects of PHI on the toxicity of AFB<sub>1</sub> in the liver of chickens. Chickens were administered with AFB<sub>1</sub> (2.8\u00a0mg/kg) and/or treated with PHI (24\u00a0mg/kg) for 33 days. The histopathological changes, serum biochemical indices, oxidative damage, inflammatory mediators, apoptosis, and activation of the NF-\u03baB and Nrf2 signaling pathways were measured. Results revealed that dietary PHI ameliorated liver function indicators, reduced the malondialdehyde and inflammatory mediator production and the apoptotic cell number, and increased the antioxidant enzyme contents and Bcl-2 level. The quantitative realtime PCR and Western blot results revealed that PHI reduced p53, cytochrome c, Bax, caspase-9, and caspase-3 levels, normalized the NF-\u03baB p65 phosphorylation, and upregulated the Nrf2 and its downstream genes expression in chicken liver. These results indicated that PHI has beneficial effects on AFB<sub>1</sub>-induced liver damage, oxidative damage, inflammatory response, apoptosis, and immunotoxicity by inhibiting NF-\u03baB and activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway in chickens. This study provides new insight into the therapeutic uses of PHI."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
