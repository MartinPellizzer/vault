This study aimed to evaluate the potential role of ILE as an antidote in tramadol-induced seizure.", "A single-blind clinical trial was undertaken to establish the efficacy and safety of ILE in patients with acute tramadol intoxication, who referred to Booali Hospital in Qazvin. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The Control group received standard care while the intervention group received intralipid emulsion (ILE) 20% in addition to the standard care. The occurrence of in-hospital seizure was compared between the groups.", "80 patients who abused tramadol and met the study criteria were randomly assigned to either the intervention (40 cases) or the control (40 cases) group. Seizure occurred in 44 (56%) patients before admission to the emergency department. There were not any statistical differences between the groups regarding sex distribution (p=0.513) and mean age (p=0.19), presenting vital signs (p < 0.05), laboratory findings (p < 0.05), and mean abused dose of tramadol (p = 0.472) as well as occurrence of prehospital seizure (p = 0.7). In-hospital seizure occurred in 15 (18.75%) cases (all in the control group; p < 0.001). The mean duration of admission was 2.01 \u00b1 1.13 days in the control group and 2.15 \u00b1 1.04 days in the intervention group (p = 0.6). The number needed to treat for ILE to prevent tramadol-induced seizure was 2.7 (37.5% absolute risk reduction).", "The findings of this study supported ILE administration, as an adjunct to standard antidote protocols, in tramadol intoxication to prevent tramadol-induced seizures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Qazvin University of Medical Sciences, Qazvin, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kazemifar", "ForeName": "Amir Mohammad", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Qazvin University of Medical Sciences, Qazvin, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yazdi", "ForeName": "Zohreh", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Qazvin University of Medical Sciences, Qazvin, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bedram", "ForeName": "Abbas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahmoudi", "ForeName": "Javad", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ziaee", "ForeName": "Mojtaba", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Arch Acad Emerg Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101740147", "ISSNLinking": "2645-4904"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "King S, Forbes K, Hanks G, Ferro C, Chambers E.
