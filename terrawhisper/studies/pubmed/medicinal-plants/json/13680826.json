Ethanol is found to induce a dose dependent increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO). The elevation in lipid peroxidative products and the loss of antioxidant defense potential are enhanced when alcohol is taken along with polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) or heated PUFA. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of curcumin and photo-irradiated curcumin on alcohol and PUFA induced LPO and lipid pro fi les in plasma. The levels of vitamin C and E were decreased significantly in alcohol + raw as well as heated PUFA groups. The treatment with curcumin and photo-irradiated curcumin (IC) increased their levels significantly. The increase was more significant in the IC group than the curcumin group. The levels of cholesterol, phospholipids (PL), triglycerides (TG), free fatty acids (FFA), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and hydroperoxides (HP) were increased significantly in alcohol + raw as well as heated PUFA groups and the treatment with curcumin and IC, brought back the levels. But the IC reduced the levels more significantly than curcumin. Thus, our results indicate that IC is a more potent antioxidant than curcumin."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Annamalai University, Annamalainagar, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rukkumani", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sri Balasubashini", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Menon", "ForeName": "Venugopal P", "Initials": "VP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IT942ZTH98", "NameOfSubstance": "Curcumin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Curcumin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperlipidemias"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["13680826", "10.1002/ptr.1254"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
