Experiments were performed over a wide range of excitation and probe wavelengths, using several data collection time scales. This has enabled us to resolve five different lifetimes ranging between 100 fs and 200 ps plus a nanosecond component. We demonstrate here and elsewhere [e.g., Durrant, J.R., Hastings, G., Joseph, D. M., Barber, J., Porter, G., & Klug, D. R. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 11632-11636] that the kinetic spectra associated with all but two of these lifetimes are clearly distinguishable. We have previously reported that a 21-ps lifetime is associated with pheophytin reduction [Hastings, G., Durrant, J. R., Hong, Q., Barber, J., Porter, G., & Klug, D. R. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 7638-7647]. In this paper, we show that it is possible to spectrally and temporally resolve stimulated emission from PS2 reaction centers with great accuracy and that this stimulated emission is largely unaffected by those kinetic components which are faster than 21 ps. The observation of a distinct stimulated emission band allows us to distinguish charge-separated states from chlorin singlet states. In this way, we are able to show that the proportion of charge-separated states prior to the 21-ps component is between 0% and 25%. We also show that the shape of the spectrum which we obtain for the state P680+Ph- is essentially invariant between 100 ps and 9 ns, and is the same as that previously reported for P680+Ph- by other researchers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Imperial College, London, U.K."}], "LastName": "Durrant", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hastings", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Joseph", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Barber", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Porter", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Klug", "ForeName": "D R", "Initials": "DR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0370623", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2960"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "53808-91-6", "NameOfSubstance": "P-680"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YF5Q9EJC8Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8347624", "10.1021/bi00083a029"]}}]}
