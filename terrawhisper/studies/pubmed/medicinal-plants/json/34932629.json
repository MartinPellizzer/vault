Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a hematopoietic stem cells disorder treated by tyrosine kinase inhibitors but often cause recurrence of the leukaemia after cessation of therapy, hence require alternative treatment. This study determines the anti-cancer effect of leaf, root and bulb methanolic and aqueous extracts of B. natalensis and C. comosum in chronic human myelogenous leukaemia (K562) cell line by MTT, Hoechst bis-benzimide nuclear and annexin V stain assays. The root methanolic extract of B. natalensis and C. comosum showed a high cytotoxicity of 8.6% and 16.7% respectively on the K562 cell line at 1,000 \u03bcg/ml concentration. Morphological loss of cell membrane integrity causing degradation of the cell and fragmentation were observed in the root methanolic extract of both plants. A high apoptosis (p < 0.0001) was induced in the K562 cells by both leaf and root extracts of the C. comosum compared to the B. natalensis. This study shows both plants possess apoptotic effect against in vitro myelogenous leukaemia which contributes to the overall anti-cancer properties of B. natalensis and C. comosum to justify future therapeutic applications against chronic myelogenous leukaemia blood cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Durban University of Technology - DUT, Department of Biotechnology and Food Technology, Steve Biko Campus, Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Padayachee", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0019-9609"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cape Peninsula University of Technology - CPUT, Department of Biotechnology and Consumer Sciences, District Six Campus, Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Odun-Ayo", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4939-4509"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cape Peninsula University of Technology - CPUT, Department of Biotechnology and Consumer Sciences, District Six Campus, Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Reddy", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101129542", "ISSNLinking": "1519-6984"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "K562 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asphodelaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "25"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34932629", "10.1590/1519-6984.251336", "S1519-69842024000100154"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
