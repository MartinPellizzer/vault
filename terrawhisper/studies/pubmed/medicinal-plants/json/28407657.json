This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done on 68 women diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria aged 18-40 years old. Participants were randomly assigned into 2 groups to receive either 1\u2009000\u2009mg omega-3 fatty acids from flaxseed oil containing 400\u2009mg \u03b1-Linolenic acid plus 400 IU vitamin E supplements (n=34) or placebo (n=34) for 12 weeks. Hormonal parameters were quantified at the beginning of the study and after 12-week intervention. After 12 weeks of intervention, compared to the placebo, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in insulin (-1.0\u00b13.5 vs. +2.7\u00b16.6\u2009\u00b5IU/mL, P=0.004), homeostasis model of assessment-estimated insulin resistance (-0.2\u00b10.8 vs. +0.6\u00b11.5, P=0.005), homeostasis model of assessment-estimated B cell function (-4.3\u00b114.3 vs. +10.5\u00b124.5, P=0.004) and a significant increase in quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (+0.006\u00b10.02 vs. -0.01\u00b10.04, P=0.008). Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids plus vitamin E led to significant reductions in serum total testosterone (-0.5\u00b10.7 vs. -0.1\u00b10.5\u2009ng/mL, P=0.008) and free testosterone (-1.2\u00b12.1 vs. -0.2\u00b11.7, P=0.04) compared to the placebo group. We did not observe any significant effect of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation on fasting plasma glucose and other hormonal profiles. Omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation for 12 weeks in PCOS women significantly improved indices of insulin resistance, total and free testosterone."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, School of Medicine, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, I.R.
