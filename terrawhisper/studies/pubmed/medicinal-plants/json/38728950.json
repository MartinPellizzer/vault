Incorporating natural chitosan as a dispersant facilitated the extraction of hydrophobic anthraquinones using purified water, considerably enhancing the eco-friendliness of the extraction methodology. To optimize extraction efficiency, an extensive evaluation of the crucial parameters influencing rhubarb yield was conducted. Furthermore, a response surface methodology was applied to optimize the extraction conditions. Under these optimized conditions, the method exhibited linearity ranges of 0.1-100\u202f\u00b5g/mL, with correlation coefficients between 0.9990 and 0.9998. The method's intraday (n = 6) and interday (n = 6) precision levels were maintained at \u22643.58%, which was considered to be within acceptable limits. The computed detection and quantification limits were 16.54-24.60 and 54.91-82.04\u202fng/mL, respectively. Consequently, this optimized method was effectively employed to extract five specific compounds (aloe-emodin, emodin, rhein, chrysophanol, and physcion) from Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, achieving recoveries ranging from 86.43% to 102.75%."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
