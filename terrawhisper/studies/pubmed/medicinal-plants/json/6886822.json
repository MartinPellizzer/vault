Significant decreases in hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (79-83%), cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (43-51%), fatty acid synthetase (17-29%) and in representative pentose-phosphate pathway (23-39%) activities accompanied the feeding of the petroleum ether-, methanol- and water-soluble fractions of garlic. Garlic paste and oil also suppressed these activities. Significant decreases in serum lipids occurred in response to the feeding of these garlic fractions: serum total cholesterol by 20-25%, low density lipoprotein cholesterol by 28-41% and triglycerides by 10-26%; but high density lipoprotein cholesterol failed to respond to these treatments. The residue remaining after solvent fractionation had little influence on these parameters. These findings were substantiated by a second study in which pullets of a commercial broiler line were fed the garlic fractions. The results confirm that garlic oil and odorous components of garlic lower cholesterol levels. An odorless water-soluble component of garlic also has this effect. The mechanism of the hypocholesterolemic action is at the level of the suppression of cholesterol biosynthesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Qureshi", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Din", "ForeName": "Z Z", "Initials": "ZZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abuirmeileh", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Burger", "ForeName": "W C", "Initials": "WC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Elson", "ForeName": "C E", "Initials": "CE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6886822", "10.1093/jn/113.9.1746"]}}]}
