However, limited information on 4-CL genes and their functions in fungi is available. In this study, we cloned the 4-CL gene (Gl21040) from Ganoderma lucidum, which spans 2178\u00a0bp and consists of 10 exons and 9 introns. We also developed RNA interference and overexpression vectors for Gl21040 to investigate its roles in G. lucidum. Our findings indicated that in the Gl21040 interference transformants, 4-CL enzyme activities decreased by 31\u00a0%-57\u00a0%, flavonoids contents decreased by 10\u00a0%-22\u00a0%, lignin contents decreased by 20\u00a0%-36\u00a0% compared to the wild-type (WT) strain. Conversely, in the Gl21040 overexpression transformants, 4-CL enzyme activity increased by 108\u00a0%-143\u00a0%, flavonoids contents increased by 8\u00a0%-37\u00a0%, lignin contents improved by 15\u00a0%-17\u00a0% compared to the WT strain. Furthermore, primordia formation was delayed by approximately 10\u00a0days in the Gl21040-interferenced transformants but occurred 3\u00a0days earlier in the Gl21040-overexpressed transformants compared to the WT strain. These results underscored the involvement of the Gl21040 gene in flavonoid synthesis, lignin synthesis, and fruiting body formation in G. lucidum."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
