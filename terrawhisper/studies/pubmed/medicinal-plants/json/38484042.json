The sensor is developed for the detection of CO-releasing molecule-3 (CORM-3) by modifying an ESIPT-switched organic fluorescent probe molecule (NDAA) onto the surface of a p-type semiconductor (BiOI). The NDAA can be excited and exhibit strong green fluorescence after responding with CORM-3, resulting in an electrode-interface photon competitive absorption effect due to the switch on ESIPT and considerably reducing the photocurrent signal. The experimental results revealed that the as-developed PEC sensor achieved good analytical performance with high selectivity and sensitivity, with a linear range of 0.01-1000 \u03bcM and a lower detection limit of 6.5 nM. This work demonstrates the great potential of the organic fluorescent probe molecule family in advancing PEC analysis. It is anticipated that our findings will stimulate the creation of diverse functional probes possessing distinctive characteristics for inventive PEC sensors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Analytical Science for Food Safety and Biology (MOE & Fujian Province), Department of Chemistry, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350108, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5117-0945"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Carbohydrate Synthesis, Key Lab of Fluorine and Silicon for Energy Materials and Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory for Green Chemistry of Jiangxi Province, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang 330022, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan International Joint Laboratory of Medicinal Plants Utilization, College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng 475000, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Analytical Science for Food Safety and Biology (MOE & Fujian Province), Department of Chemistry, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350108, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Zhichao", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Analytical Science for Food Safety and Biology (MOE & Fujian Province), Department of Chemistry, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350108, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Di", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0134-3983"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Analytical Science for Food Safety and Biology (MOE & Fujian Province), Department of Chemistry, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350108, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Dianping", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "tricarbonylchloro(glycinato)ruthenium(II)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorescent Dyes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16338-97-9", "NameOfSubstance": "diallylnitrosamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organometallic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrosamines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protons"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescent Dyes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organometallic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrosamines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38484042", "10.1021/acs.analchem.4c00324"]}}]}
