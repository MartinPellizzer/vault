Although PG and AMG have similar components of ginsenosides, there are many differences of their bioactivities. In this study, the biochemical mechanisms of different bioactivities of PG and AMG were explored by researching the differential metabolites in plasma after administration of each of PG and AMG.", "In order to explore the material basis of differential bioactivities, two groups of mice were administrated orally with PG and AMG, and the method of metabolomics was used to identify the differential metabolites in plasma. Then network pharmacology was used based on the differential metabolites. Afterward, the metabolite-target-pathway network of PG and AMG was constructed; thus the pathways related to different bioactivities were analyzed.", "Through principal component analysis and orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis, there were 10 differential metabolites identified in the PG group and 8 differential metabolites identified in the AMG group. Based on network pharmacology, the differential metabolites were classified and related to differential bioactivities of PG and AMG. In the PG group, there were 6 metabolites related to aphrodisiac effect and exciting the nervous system, and 5 metabolites associated with raised blood pressure. In the AMG group, 5 metabolites were classified as having the effect of inhibiting the nervous system, and 6 metabolites were related to antihypertensive effect.", "This study explored the material basis of the differential biological activities between PG and AMG, which is significant for the research of PG and AMG use and to promote human health."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Product Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Jilin University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jihua", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Product Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Jilin University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Qinghai", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Product Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Jilin University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Guangguang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Product Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Jilin University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Product Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Jilin University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Product Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Jilin University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jiayin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Product Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Jilin University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Product Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Jilin University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Hongliu", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3760-6455"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Product Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Jilin University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Jianyuan", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2018B01", "Agency": "Bethune Plan from Jilin University", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2017YFC1702100", "Agency": "National Key Research and Development Plan of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "101832020CX318", "Agency": "Graduate Innovation Fund of Jilin University", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "8802365", "ISSNLinking": "0951-4198"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Network Pharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plasma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Principal Component Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Liu L, Xu F, Wang Y.
