The aim of this work was to evaluate the pharmacological properties of essential oil from Lippia origanoides Kunth. (Verbenaceae).", "The oil was extracted by hydrodistillation and the constituents were identified and quantified by GC-MS and GC-FID. The essential oil from L. origanoides was evaluated in hemolysis tests, on the activities of phospholipases A2 and serine proteases and in coagulation and thrombolysis induced by different snake venoms.", "The major constituents of essential oil were carvacrol, p-cymene, \u03b3-terpinene, and thymol. The oil inhibited approximately 10 % of the phospholipase A2 activity induced by Bothrops atrox, Bothrops jararaca, Bothrops jararacussu and Bothrops moojeni venoms and was not cytotoxic against erythrocytes. However, previous incubation of the oil with B. jararacussu, B. moojeni, and Crotalus durissus terrificus (C.d.t.) venoms resulted in potentiation of hemolytic activity (30 % and 50 % for 0.6 \u00b5L mL-1 and 1.2 \u00b5L mL-1, respectively). The essential oil presented a procoagulant effect on human citrated plasma, potentiated the thrombolytic action of proteases and phospholipases A2 present in B. jararacussu venom, and serine protease activity induced by B. jararaca and Lachesis muta venoms. When pre-incubated with the C.d.t. venom, however, prothrombotic activity was observed.", "The results obtained in this work amplify the pharmacological characterization of the essential oil from L. origanoides. However, new studies are fundamental to define the action mechanisms and determine pharmaceutical applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Lavras, CP: 3037, 37200-000, Lavras, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Teixeira", "ForeName": "Maria L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Lavras, CP: 3037, 37200-000, Lavras, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Marcussi", "ForeName": "Silvana", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Lavras, CP: 3037, 37200-000, Lavras, Brazil."}], "LastName": "de C S Rezende", "ForeName": "Danubia A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, Federal University of Lavras, CP: 3037, 37200-000, Lavras, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Magalh\u00e3es", "ForeName": "Maisa L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal University of Vales de Jequitinhonha e Mucuri, Diamantina, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Nelson", "ForeName": "David L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Lavras, CP: 3037, 37200-000, Lavras, Brazil."}], "LastName": "das G Cardoso", "ForeName": "Maria", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101240303", "ISSNLinking": "1573-4064"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipase A2 Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Serine Proteinase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Snake Venoms"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipases A2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Serine Proteases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Coagulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipase A2 Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipases A2"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Serine Proteases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Serine Proteinase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Snake Venoms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Verbenaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30160215", "10.2174/1573406414666180829150515", "MC-EPUB-92683"]}}]}
