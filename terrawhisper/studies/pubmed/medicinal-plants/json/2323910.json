The purification obtained was 255 fold. The enzyme preparations were homogenous by the criteria of SDS-PAGE and analytical gel electrofocusing. The protein contained 0.11% of iron that corresponds to a minimum molecular size of 50,700. Determinations of molecular size by SDS-PAGE gave values of 48,000 +/- 1,000 while the one obtained by Sephadex gel filtration was 49,000. The pH optimum of the enzyme was 6.0. The activation energy was estimated to be 6 Kcal/mol. The prosthetic group was shown to be ferriprotoporphyrin IX. The presence of 13% neutral sugars was found. The spectrophotometric analysis showed the presence, in the visible region, of absorption maxima at 403, 490 and 633 nm. The Rz value (A403/A275) was 2.7."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Istituto di Chimica Biologica, Universit\u00e0, Cagliari."}], "LastName": "Cogoni", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Medda", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saba", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Floris", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Ital J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0376564", "ISSNLinking": "0021-2938"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2323910"]}}]}
