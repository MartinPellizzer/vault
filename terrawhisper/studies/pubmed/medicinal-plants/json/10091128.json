All aspects of reproduction can be affected: mating behavior and libido in males; estrus in females; abortion/embryonic loss of the fetus; and behavioral retardation of offspring. While much research has been done to describe and histologically characterize these effects, we have only begun to understand the magnitude of the problem, to define the mechanisms involved, or to develop strategies to prevent losses. Recent research has described the effects of locoweed ingestion in cycling cows and ewes. Briefly, feeding trials with locoweeds in cycling and pregnant cows have demonstrated ovarian dysfunction in a dose-dependent pattern, delayed estrus, extended estrous cycle length during the follicular and luteal phases, delayed conception (repeat breeders), and hydrops and abortion. Similar effects were observed in sheep. In rams, locoweed consumption altered breeding behavior, changed libido, and inhibited normal spermatogenesis. Neurological dysfunction also inhibited normal reproductive behavior, and some of these effects were permanent and progressive. In this article we briefly review the pathophysiological effects of locoweeds on reproduction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Poisonous Plant Research Laboratory, USDA Agricultural Research Service, Logan, UT 84341, USA. kpanter@cc.usu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Panter", "ForeName": "K E", "Initials": "KE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "James", "ForeName": "L F", "Initials": "LF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stegelmeier", "ForeName": "B L", "Initials": "BL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ralphs", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pfister", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Toxins", "NlmUniqueID": "9208016", "ISSNLinking": "1058-8108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "H6241UJ22B", "NameOfSubstance": "Selenium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ruminants"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Selenium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sexual Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatozoa"}], "NumberOfReferences": "49"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10091128"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
