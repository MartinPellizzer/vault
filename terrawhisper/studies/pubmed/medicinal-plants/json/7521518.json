The root tip cells were exposed to the tannery effluents at different concentrations for varying durations. Squash preparations were made following Haematoxylin staining procedures. Cytological investigations revealed a duration- and concentration-dependent decrease in mitotic frequency and an increase in chromosomal irregularities. The root meristems pre-treated with effluents for 8 h (Raw-to-Wetblue) and 24 h (Wetblue-to-Finish) which caused the maximum incidence of mitotic anomalies, were then exposed to the crude extract of Phyllanthus amarus (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1%) to study its efficacy modifying genetic damage. It was observed that the root meristems post-treated with Phyllanthus showed a significant reduction in the frequency of chromosomal alterations. However, there was no significant variation in the mitotic frequency. The study suggests that Phyllanthin, a principle of Phyllanthus amarus, is antigenotoxic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "P.G. & Research Department of Botany, Pachayappa's College, Madras, India."}], "LastName": "Gowrishanker", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vivekanandan", "ForeName": "O S", "Initials": "OS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Aberrations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitotic Index"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tanning"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7521518", "10.1016/0165-1218(94)90005-1", "0165-1218(94)90005-1"]}}]}
