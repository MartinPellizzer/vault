Since ancient times, the importance of wound healing has been recognized, and many efforts have been made to develop novel wound dressings made of the best material for rapid and effective wound healing. Medicinal plants play a great role in the wound healing process. In recent decades, many studies have focused on the development of novel wound dressings that incorporate medicinal plant extracts or their purified active compounds, which are potential alternatives to conventional wound dressings. Several studies have also investigated the mechanism of action of various herbal medicines in wound healing process. This paper attempts to highlight and review the mechanistic perspective of wound healing mediated by plant-based natural products. The findings showed that herbal medicines act through multiple mechanisms and are involved in various stages of wound healing. Some herbal medicines increase the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) which play important role in stimulation of re-epithelialization, angiogenesis, formation of granulation tissue, and collagen fiber deposition. Some other wound dressing containing herbal medicines act as inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expression thereby inducing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in various phases of the wound healing process. Besides the growing public interest in traditional and alternative medicine, the use of herbal medicine and natural products for wound healing has many advantages over conventional medicines, including greater effectiveness due to diverse mechanisms of action, antibacterial activity, and safety in long-term wound dressing usage."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
