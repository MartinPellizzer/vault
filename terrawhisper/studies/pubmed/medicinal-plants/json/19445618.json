Half (n = 217) of the women with FM reported taking antidepressant drugs; more reported selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI)-type with moderate effectiveness than tricyclic amines deemed to have strong effectiveness. Few were taking dual uptake inhibitors or the now approved pregabalin. Nearly 30% reported taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), which have weak efficacy evidence. Less than 8% of controls reported taking either antidepressants or NSAID. Having FM was associated with these medications plus guaifenesen, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, narcotics, other analgesics, and benzodiazepines. Highest effectiveness scores were for opioid narcotics and guaifenesin. Forty-three percent of women with FM reported taking at least one herb/supplement compared with 23% of control women. The most common types were omega esterified fatty acids, glucosamine, and gingko. No particular type distinguished between the groups. Both groups tended to rate overall effectiveness lower for herbs/supplements than for conventional medications.", "Substantial numbers of women with FM were taking pain medications that often lacked evidence for effectiveness. The variety of medications being taken by women with FM compared with women without FM indicates that there are few medications that consistently provide symptom alleviation for this condition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Illinois at Chicago, College of Nursing, 845 S.
