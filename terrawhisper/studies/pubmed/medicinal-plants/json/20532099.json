Poor quality of Ayurveda graduates produced as a result of poorly structured and poorly regulated education system is at least one of the important factors responsible for this scenario. The present study was carried out to evaluate the 'Global challenges of graduate level Ayurvedic education' and is based on the responses of Ayurvedic students and Ayurvedic teachers from various educational institutions of India to a methodically validated questionnaire. As the study indicates, the poor standard of Ayurvedic education in India is definitely a cause of concern. The curriculum of Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) course of studies is required to be reviewed and restructured. The syllabi are required to be updated with certain relevant topics like laws governing the intellectual property rights, basic procedures of standardization of medicinal products, fundamental methods of evaluating the toxicity of the medicinal products, essentials of healthcare management and the basics of cultivation and marketing of medicinal plants. Furthermore, the study suggests that the Ayurvedic academicians are required to be trained in standard methods of research and documentation skills, and the educational institutions are required to be encouraged to contribute their share in building up the evidence base for Ayurveda in the form of quality education and research."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Kriya Sharir,Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Patwardhan", "ForeName": "Kishor", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gehlot", "ForeName": "Sangeeta", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Girish", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rathore", "ForeName": "H C S", "Initials": "HC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Int J Ayurveda Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101527491", "ISSNLinking": "0974-7788"}, "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflict of Interest:</b> None declared"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": " Available from:  http://nccam.nih.gov/health/ayurveda/introduction.htm#ususe.
