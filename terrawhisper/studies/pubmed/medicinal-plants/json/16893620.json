The importance and the potential of research into the medical aspects of the Genizah documents were clear to researcher since the early 1960s. A few works have been published since, usually focusing on one subject, or even important single manuscripts. The current research concerned mainly with one aspect of the history of medicine of the Jewish community of Cairo (as a reflection of Eastern medieval societies), namely the practical uses of natural substances for medicine. The most interesting and original information is undoubtedly to be found in the 141 prescriptions, as they reflect the medical reality that actually existed. And indeed, 242 substances were recorded in the prescriptions identified: 195 substances of plants origin (80.6%), 27 inorganic materials (11.2%) and 20 substances of animal origin (8.2%) were recorded as being in practical used for medicinal purposes. The most frequently mentioned substances were the rose, myrobalan, sugar, almonds, and endive. The most prevalent ailments: eye diseases, headache, constipations (purgative), cough, skin diseases, stomach, fever, gynaecological problems, haemorrhoids, liver ailments, lice, swellings, dental trouble, ulcers, and problems of the urinary tract."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eretz Israel Studies and School of Public Health, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel. efraiml@research.haifa.ac.il"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lev", "ForeName": "Efraim", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amar", "ForeName": "Zohar", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cough"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Prescriptions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Egypt"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Fever"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Medieval"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Jews"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Manuscripts, Medical as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United Kingdom"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16893620", "10.1016/j.jep.2006.06.005", "S0378-8741(06)00296-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
