Antivirulence strategy is an especially compelling alternative strategy due to its low selective pressure for the development of drug resistance in bacteria. Plants and microorganisms are not only important food and medicinal resources but also serve as sources for the discovery of natural products that target bacterial virulence factors. This review discusses the mechanisms of the major virulence factors of <i>S. aureus</i>, including the accessory gene regulator quorum-sensing system, bacterial biofilm formation, \u03b1-hemolysin, sortase A, and staphyloxanthin. We also provide an overview of natural products isolated from plants and microorganisms with activity against the major virulence factors of <i>S. aureus</i> and their adjuvant effects on existing antibiotics to overcome antibiotic-resistant <i>S. aureus</i>. Finally, the limitations and solutions of these antivirulence compounds are discussed, which will help in the development of novel antibacterial drugs against antibiotic-resistant <i>S. aureus</i>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8282-2646"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Food Nutrition and Human Health, College of Veterinary Medicine , China Agricultural University , No. 2 Yuanmingyuan West Road , Beijing 100193 , People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Veterinary Medicine , Qingdao Agricultural University , No. 700 Changcheng Road , Qingdao , Shandong 266109 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Shuai-Cheng", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Food Nutrition and Human Health, College of Veterinary Medicine , China Agricultural University , No. 2 Yuanmingyuan West Road , Beijing 100193 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8242-3952"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Food Nutrition and Human Health, College of Veterinary Medicine , China Agricultural University , No. 2 Yuanmingyuan West Road , Beijing 100193 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Kui", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Food Nutrition and Human Health, College of Veterinary Medicine , China Agricultural University , No. 2 Yuanmingyuan West Road , Beijing 100193 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Jian-Zhong", "Initials": "JZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Virulence Factors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcal Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Virulence Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31702908", "10.1021/acs.jafc.9b05595"]}}]}
