Several hundred new compounds have been isolated from the liverworts (Marchantiophyta), and more than 40 new carbon skeletons of terpenoids and aromatic compounds were found. Most of the liverworts studied elaborate characteristic odiferous, pungent, and bitter-tasting compounds, of which many show antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, allergic contact dermatitis, cytotoxic, insecticidal, anti-HIV, plant growth regulatory, neurotrophic, NO production and superoxide anion radical release inhibitory, muscle relaxing, antiobesity, piscicidal, and nematocidal activities. The biological effects ascribed to the liverworts are mainly due to lipophilic sesqui- and diterpenoids, phenolic compounds, and polyketides, which are the principal constituents of their oil bodies. Some mosses and liverworts produce significant levels of vitamin B<sub>2</sub> and tocopherols, as well as prostaglandin-like highly unsaturated fatty acids. The most characteristic chemical phenomenon of the liverworts is that most of the sesqui- and diterpenoids are enantiomers of those found in higher plants. In this review, the chemical constituents and potential medicinal uses of bryophytes are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1847-412X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Tokushima Bunri University , Yamashiro-cho, Tokushima 770-8514 , Japan."}], "LastName": "Asakawa", "ForeName": "Yoshinori", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy with Medicinal Plant Unit , Medical University of Lublin , 20-093 Lublin , Poland."}], "LastName": "Ludwiczuk", "ForeName": "Agnieszka", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bryophyta"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coleoptera"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatophyta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nematoda"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29019405", "10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b01046"]}}]}
