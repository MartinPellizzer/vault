This novel material was applied for ultrasound assisted adsorption of congo red (CR) as model of toxic and even carcinogenic substance from aqueous solution. The detail of morphology and identity of Au-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-AC was characterized by SEM and TEM techniques and correlation among response to variables such as pH (2-10), adsorbent mass (0.005-0.025\u202fg), initial CR concentration (10-30\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup>) and ultrasound time (2-6\u202fmin) was investigated by response surface methodology (RSM) under central composite design (CCD). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) exhibit a high R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.999 and confirm suitability of constructed second-order regression model for excellent evaluation and prediction of the experimental data. The interaction and main factor and optimum conditions of the under study process were determined from response surface plots based on desirability function. The maximum CR adsorption were achieved at pH of 4, 15\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> of CR, 0.017\u202fg of Au-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-AC and 5\u202fmin sonication which owing to 99.49% removal efficiency is highly recommended for future CR removal from different matrixes. Adsorption kinetic follow second-order rate expression in combination to inter particle diffusion and equilibrium adsorption data best represented by the Langmuir isotherm with maximum mono-layer adsorption capacity of 43.88\u202fmg\u202fg<sup>-1</sup>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
