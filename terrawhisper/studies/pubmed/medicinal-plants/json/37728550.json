Currently, no medication is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for treating rotavirus A-induced diarrhoea. Consequently, it is important to focus on developing prophylactic and curative therapeutics to combat rotaviral infections. For the first time, this study computationally screened and identified metabolites from <i>Spondias mombin</i>, <i>Macaranga barteri</i> and <i>Dicerocaryum eriocarpum</i> as potential novel inhibitors with broad-spectrum activity against VP5* and VP8* (spike protein) of rotavirus A (RVA). The initial top 20 metabolites identified through molecular docking were further filtered using drug-likeness and pharmacokinetics parameters. The molecular properties of the resulting top-ranked compounds were predicted by conducting density functional theory (DFT) calculations, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed their thermodynamic compatibility with a significant affinity towards VP8* than VP5*. Except for ellagic acid (-11.78\u2009kcal/mol), the lead compounds had higher binding free energy than the reference standard (VP5* (-11.81\u2009kcal/mol), VP8* (-14.12\u2009kcal/mol)) with 2SG (-20.98\u2009kcal/mol) and apigenin-4'-glucoside (-23.56\u2009kcal/mol) having the highest affinity towards VP5* and VP8*, respectively. Of all the top-ranked compounds, better broad-spectrum affinities for both VP5* and VP8* than tizoxanide were observed in 2SG (VP5* (-20.98\u2009kcal/mol), VP8* (-20.13\u2009kcal/mol)) and sericetin (VP5* (-20.46\u2009kcal/mol), VP8* (-18.31\u2009kcal/mol)). While the identified leads could be regarded as potential modulators of the investigated therapeutic targets for effective management of rotaviral infection, additional <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> and <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> evaluation is strongly recommended, and efforts are on-going in this regard.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
