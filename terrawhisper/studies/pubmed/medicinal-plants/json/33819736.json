The structures and the absolute configurations of these compounds were elucidated by the spectroscopic data, single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations. Compounds 1, 4-6, 9-14, and 18 showed obvious cell autophagy-inducing activities at 25\u00a0\u03bcM in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the bioassay results also showed that 18 induced cell autophagy in a dose dependent manner. Our findings revealed a rare class of monoterpene-flavonoid conjugates in nature and firstly reported their autophagy-inducing activities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
