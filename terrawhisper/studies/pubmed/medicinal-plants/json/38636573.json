Currently, several therapeutic options are accessible for treating BPH, including medication therapy, surgery and watchful waiting. Conventional drugs such as finasteride and dutasteride are used as 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors for the treatment of BPH. However long-term use of these drugs is restricted due to their unpleasant side effects. Despite the range of available medical therapies, the effective treatment against BPH is still inadequate. Certain therapeutic plants and their phytochemicals have the aforementioned goals and work by regulating this enzyme.", "This review aims to provide a comprehensive insight to advancements in diagnosis of BPH, modern treatment methods and the significance of ethnobotanically relevant medicinal plants as alternative therapeutics for managing BPH.", "A thorough and systematic literature search was performed using electronic databases and search engines such as PubMed, Web of Science, NCBI and SciFinder till October 2023. Specific keywords such as \"benign prostatic hyperplasia\", \"medicinal plants\", \"phytochemicals\", \"pharmacology\", \"synergy\", \"ethnobotany\", \"5-alpha reductase\", \"alpha blocker\" and \"toxicology\". By include these keywords, a thorough investigation of pertinent papers was assured, and important data about the many facets of BPH could be retrieved.", "After conducting the above investigation, 104 herbal remedies were found to inhibit Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibition, alpha-blockers, or 5\u03b1 -reductase inhibition effects which are supported by in vitro, in vivo and clinical trial studies evidence. Of these, 89 plants have ethnobotanical significance as alpha-blockers, alpha-reductase inhibition, or PDE-5 inhibition, and the other fifteen plants were chosen based on their ability to reduce BPH risk factors. Several phytocompounds, including, rutaecarpine, vaccarin, rutin, kaempferol, \u03b2-sitosterol, quercetin, dicaffeoylquinic acid, rutaevin, and phytosterol-F have been reported to be useful for the management of BPH. The use of combination therapy offers a strong approach to treating long-term conditions compare to single plant extract drugs. Furthermore, several botanical combinations such as lycopene and curcumin, pumpkin seed oil and saw palmetto oil, combinations of extracts from Funtumia africana (Benth.) Stapf and Abutilon mauritianum (Jacq.) Medik., and Hypselodelphys poggeana (K.Schum.) Milne-Redh. and Spermacoce radiata (DC.) Sieber ex Hiern are also supported through in vitro and in vivo studies for managing BPH through recuperation in patients with chronic long-term illnesses, as measured by the International Prostate Symptom Score.", "The review proposes and endorses careful utilization of conventional medications that may be investigated further to discover possible PDE-5, 5 alpha-reductase, an alpha-blocker inhibitor for managing BPH. Even though most conventional formulations, such as 5 alpha-reductase, are readily available, systemic assessment of the effectiveness and mechanism of action of the herbal constituents is still necessary to identify novel chemical moieties that can be further developed for maximum efficacy. However, there exist abundant botanicals and medicinal plants across several regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas, which can be further studied and developed for utilization as a potential phytotherapeutic for the management of BPH."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
