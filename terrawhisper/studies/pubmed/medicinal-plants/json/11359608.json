In animals, the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of peptides acts via Ser/Thr receptor kinases to have a major impact on several pathways involved in animal development and adult homeostasis. TGF-beta receptor-interacting protein (TRIP-1) was previously shown by others to be an intracellular substrate of the TGF-beta type II receptor kinase which plays an important role in TGF-beta signaling. TRIP-1 is a WD-repeat protein that also has a dual role as an essential subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF3 in animals, yeast and plants, thereby revealing a putative link between a developmental signaling pathway and the control of protein translation. In yeast, expression of a TRIP-1 homolog has also been closely associated with cell proliferation and progression through the cell cycle. We report here the novel observation that transcript levels of TRIP-1 homologs in plants are regulated by BR treatment under a variety of conditions, and that transgenic plants expressing antisense TRIP-1 RNA exhibit a broad range of developmental defects, including some that resemble the phenotype of BR-deficient and -insensitive mutants. This correlative evidence suggests that a WD-domain protein with reported dual functions in vertebrates and fungi might mediate some of the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of plant growth and development by BRs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695-7609, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clouse", "ForeName": "S D", "Initials": "SD"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["AF335551"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant J", "NlmUniqueID": "9207397", "ISSNLinking": "0960-7412"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antisense Elements (Genetics)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Arabidopsis Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Brassinosteroids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholestanols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Steroids, Heterocyclic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "TRIP-1 protein, Arabidopsis"}, {"RegistryNumber": "171601-26-6", "NameOfSubstance": "EIF3I protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y9IQ1L53OX", "NameOfSubstance": "brassinolide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antisense Elements (Genetics)"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Northern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brassinosteroids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cholestanols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Consensus Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-3"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Structures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Structure, Tertiary"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Repetitive Sequences, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Steroids, Heterocyclic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11359608", "10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01007.x", "tpj1007"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
