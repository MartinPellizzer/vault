In this study, low molecular weight peptides were isolated from seeds/leaves of 20 medicinal plants and tested for their antibacterial activity against laboratory strains of S. aureusand P. aeruginosa. Peptides isolated from Peganum harmala (PhAMP) exhibited maximum activity against laboratory strains. As clinical-isolates are more virulent and resistant to antibiotics, we tested the potential of PhAMP on these bacterial strains isolated from infected wounds. Pathogens isolated from burn-wounds (S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae) and surgical-wounds (P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae) exhibited zones of inhibition against PhAMP when tested by disc diffusion method. Biofilm formation of wound pathogens in the presence/absence of PhAMP was analyzed to check its effect. Surgical-wound pathogens and K. pneumoniae from burn-wound showed significant reduction in biofilm formation and planktonic bacteria. While biofilms of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa from burn-wound showed resistance against PhAMP. An effective antibiotic treatment should not only inhibit but should also disrupt already developed biofilms. PhAMP was very effective in the disruption of developed biofilm of all pathogens after 36 hours. This data unravels the potential of PhAMP as a novel, natural antibiotic against clinical-pathogens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, Quaide Azam Campus, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khalid", "ForeName": "Rida", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry Department, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Jaffar", "ForeName": "Qudsia", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, Quaide Azam Campus, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Tayyeb", "ForeName": "Asima", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, Quaide Azam Campus, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Qaisar", "ForeName": "Uzma", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Burns"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peganum"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "isolation & purification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "isolation & purification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Surgical Wound"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30587467"]}}]}
