Their use relies mostly on historical and anecdotal evidence and might be so hazardous. Phytophotodermatitis is a well-known entity that is caused by the sequential exposure to certain species of plants containing furocoumarins and then to sunlight. In this article, superficial burn lesions caused by fig leaf decoction that was applied to a patient's both upper extremity as a remedy for a dermatitis of unknown etiology is reported. Direct sun exposure is an essential component of phytophotodermatitis. All reported cases to date have in common that patients are exposed to direct sunlight or to artificial UVA lights (like solarium) of varying durations. In our case neither direct sun exposure, other than inevitable indoor UVA influence, nor blister formation was present. The etiologic factors, symptoms, signs, course, and treatment alternatives for phytophotodermatitis are also reviewed briefly."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plastic and Recosntructive Surgery, Division of Hand Surgery, Burn Center, Medical Faculty of Uludag University, Bursa, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozdamar", "ForeName": "Erkut", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozbek", "ForeName": "Serhat", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akin", "ForeName": "Sel\u00e7uk", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Burn Care Rehabil", "NlmUniqueID": "8110188", "ISSNLinking": "0273-8481"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Furocoumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Burns, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ficus"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Furocoumarins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Photosensitivity Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14501418", "10.1097/01.BCR.0000076058.74339.C6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
