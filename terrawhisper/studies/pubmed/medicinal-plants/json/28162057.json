Some epidemiological and genetic studies propose a role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. To our knowledge, there is no study regarding the anti-inflammatory activity of pramipexol. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate anti-inflammatory effect of pramipexol. Anti-inflammatory effects of pramipexole were studied in three well-characterized animal models of inflammation, including carrageenan- or formalin-induced paw inflammation in rats, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced ear edema in mice. The animals received pramipexol (0.25, 0.5 and 1\u2009mg/kg, I.P.) 30\u2009min before subplantar injection of carrageenan or\u2009formalin. Pramipexol (0.5 and 1\u2009mg/kg) was also injected 30\u2009min before topical application of TPA on the ear mice. Serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were evaluated in the carrageenan test. Finally, pathological examination of the inflamed tissues was carried out. Pramipexole significantly inhibited paw inflammation 1, 2, 3 and 4\u2009h after carrageenan challenge compared with the control group (p\u2009<\u2009.001). Pramipexol also showed considerable anti-inflammatory activity against formalin-evoked paw edema over a period of 24\u2009h (p\u2009<\u2009.001). TPA-induced ear edema was markedly decreased by pramipexol (p\u2009<\u2009.001). The pathological evaluation of the paws and ears revealed that pramipexole reduced tissue injury, neutrophil infiltration, and subcutaneous edema. Pramipexole did not alter the increased serum levels of MDA due to carrageenan injection. These data clearly indicate that pramipexol possesses significant anti-inflammatory activity. It seems that its antioxidants do not play an important role in these effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences , Yasuj , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences , Yasuj , Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghi", "ForeName": "Heibatollah", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Student Research Committee , Yasuj University of Medical Sciences , Yasuj , Iran."}], "LastName": "Parishani", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences , Yasuj , Iran."}], "LastName": "Akbartabar Touri", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Student Research Committee , Yasuj University of Medical Sciences , Yasuj , Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghavamzadeh", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences , Yasuj , Iran."}], "LastName": "Jafari Barmak", "ForeName": "Mehrzad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Behbahan Faculty of Medical Sciences , Behbahan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Zarezade", "ForeName": "Vahid", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences , Yasuj , Iran."}], "LastName": "Delaviz", "ForeName": "Hamdollah", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences , Yasuj , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences , Yasuj , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine , Yasuj University of Medical Sciences , Yasuj , Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghi", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8800150", "ISSNLinking": "0892-3973"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzothiazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "83619PEU5T", "NameOfSubstance": "Pramipexole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9000-07-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Carrageenan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NI40JAQ945", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzothiazoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carrageenan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Parkinson Disease, Secondary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pramipexole"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28162057", "10.1080/08923973.2017.1284230"]}}]}
