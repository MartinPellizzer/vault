The results showed that the hypothesis of Zha-xun\"s origin mainly included \"source of mine\", \"source of feces\", \"source of monkey menstrual blood\" in China. There were \"source of fossil\", \"source of the plant secretion\" abroad. The authors had interviewed the villagers at origin, herbalists, Tibetan doctors, herb dealers, foreign scholars for a total of 18 people, and collecting 45 batches medicinal materials. According to ancient Tibetan classics textual and Tibetan medicine doctors' views, medicinal materials were divided into the genuine and the substitutes. The genuine was identified as ancient so-called \"iron\" type \"Zha-xun\", and the substitute was fecal pellet bonding briquette. According to the field survey and literature research, \"source of fossil\" more in line with substance of Zha-xun was derived from the rock. As the results, the author believed that Zha-xun was the mixture of organic fossils from the rock seepage with flying squirrel, pika feces. So it is needed to be set up Zha-xun classification standard to evaluate the quality of medicinal materials. Meanwhile, it was necessary to further clarify fecal pellet substitute rationality. Above all, this article clarified the status of the use of Tibetan medicine-\"Zha-xun\", and laid the foundation of species systematics and quality standards research of \"Zha-xun\"."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM), Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Yun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ethnomedicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM), Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Ming-Ming", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM), Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Yu-Ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Medical Colledge, Chengdu 610083, China."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Shi-Hong", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aba Prefecture Tibetan Hosptal of Sichuan, Aba 624000, China."}], "LastName": "Rang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aba county Tibetan Hosptal, Aba 624600, China."}], "LastName": "Mi", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Tibetan Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28936853", "10.4268/cjcmm20162428"]}}]}
