The Hindu temples of Lord Sri Laxminarasimha Swamy and Lord Hanuman, and the ethnic worship of mahua trees indicated it was a sacred grove which was selected as a Medicinal Plants Conservation Area. The exploration of Mallur Gutta resulted in the enumeration and documentation of plant wealth representing 470 species of 318 genera pertaining to 95 families of vascular plants. The importance of the grove as the residence for many rare or medicinal species in the state of Telangana is documented. The plant diversity is analyzed in terms of growth and life forms which indicate the prevailing microclimate, ecological opportunities and the species richness. The ecological services rendered by the Mallur Gutta forest ecosystem are documented to study how the great majority of the species are used by the ethnic and nonethnic people, and also the pilgrims who visit the shrine for its serenity. The study also identified two major threats to the conservation of hill ecosystem and the archeological site: 1) biotic pressure (the ever-increasing pilgrims, grazing by cattle, goat and sheep, the development activities taken up for the pilgrims, nondegradable litter thrown, collection of medicinal plants and widening of the pathway to the Chintamani perennial stream - the trampling and alien plant invasions of the marsh sustaining the stream); and 2) the potential for fire spreading from burning the litter. The study suggests the need to initiate remedial measures toward ecosystem recovery through fencing the natural vegetation, maintaining a fire line, and restricting the movement of people and domesticated animals on the hill top."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad."}], "LastName": "Suthari", "ForeName": "Sateesh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Systematics Laboratory, Department of Botany, Kakatiya University, Warangal, India."}], "LastName": "Kandagalta", "ForeName": "Ramesh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Systematics Laboratory, Department of Botany, Kakatiya University, Warangal, India."}], "LastName": "Ragan", "ForeName": "Ajmeera", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Systematics Laboratory, Department of Botany, Kakatiya University, Warangal, India."}], "LastName": "Raju", "ForeName": "Vatsavaya S", "Initials": "VS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "New Zealand", "MedlineTA": "Int J Gen Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101515487", "ISSNLinking": "1178-7074"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Raju VS, Reddy CS, Suthari S.
