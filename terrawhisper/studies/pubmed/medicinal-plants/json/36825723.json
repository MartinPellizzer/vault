Meanwhile, chalcones are important precursors for synthetic manipulations and act as mediators in the synthesis of useful therapeutic compounds, which have demonstrated a wide range of biological activities. Numerous studies have reported the synthesis and medicinal significance of chalcone derivatives. Cancer is one of the major causes of death worldwide. Although various therapies have been proposed for diverse types of cancer, their associated limitations and side effects urged researchers to develop more safe, potent and selective anticancer agents. Based on the literature review, the presence of chalcone derivatives as the main component, a substituent, or a side-chain in different biologically active compounds could serve as a reliable platform for synthetic organic chemists to synthesize new compounds bearing this moiety, owing to their similar or superior activities compared to those of the standards. The diversity of the chalcone family also lends itself to broad-spectrum biological applications in oncology. This review, therefore, sheds light on the latest structure and the anticancer potency of different synthetics (bearing other anticancer pharmacophores based on simple, functional groups, and dimer chalcone derivatives) and natural chalcone hybrids. It is confirmed that the information compiled in this review article, many chalcone hybrids have been found with promising anticancer activities. Therefore, this review may be convenient for designing novel chalcone molecules with enhanced medicinal properties according to the structure of the compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, 050017, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jiahui", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, 050017, China."}], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Jianmei", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, 050017, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Shuxian", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, 050017, China."}], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "Tingyu", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, 050017, China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Tenghao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, 050017, China."}], "LastName": "Huo", "ForeName": "Dezhen", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, 050017, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, 050017, China."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Ran", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101265649", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "5S5A2Q39HX", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chalcone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chalcones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36825723", "10.2174/1871520623666230223112530", "ACAMC-EPUB-129737"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
