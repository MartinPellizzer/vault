A dispersive micro solid phase extraction (d\u00b5SPE) for preconcentration of trace Pb, Cd, Hg, Co, Ni ions using pectin coated magnetic graphene oxide (pectin/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/GO) is presented. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP/OES) was utilized for analyzing the samples. The influence of parameters name as pH, extraction time, sample volume and amount of sorbent were optimized using central composite design (CCD) methodology. Detection and quantification limits were between 0.01 and 0.21\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> and 0.04-0.67\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> of fresh fish sample, respectively. Accuracy of the method verified using certified reference materials (NIST-SRM-1946). Concentration of the toxic heavy metals were successfully determined in 11 different fish samples using the proposed method."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
