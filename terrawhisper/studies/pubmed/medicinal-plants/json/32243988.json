Negative control wells were devoid of the extracts and drug but supplemented with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Efficacy of treatment was observed at 1\u00a0h interval for complete immobilisation or reduced motility of the parasites. Each incubated mixture was inoculated into mouse at the point of complete immobilisation of parasite motility or at the end of 6-h observation period for concentrations that did not immobilise the parasites completely. For in vivo assessment, thirty-five parasitaemic rats were randomly allocated into seven groups of 5 rats each. Each rat in groups I-V was treated with 500\u00a0mg/kg of AL, KS, Pt, AL\u00a0+\u00a0KS and AL\u00a0+\u00a0KS\u00a0+\u00a0Pt, respectively, for 7 days. Rats in groups VI and VII were treated with diminazene aceturate 3.5\u00a0mg/kg once and PBS 2\u00a0mL/kg (7 days), which served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Daily monitoring of parasitaemia through the tail vein, packed cell volume and malondialdehyde were used to assess efficacy of the treatments.", "The AL\u00a0+\u00a0KS\u00a0+\u00a0Pt group significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and dose-dependently reduced parasite motility and completely immobilized the parasites at 10, 5 and 2.5\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 9.1\u00d710<sup>-4</sup> \u00b5g/\u00b5L. All the mice with conditions that produced complete cessation of parasite motility did not develop parasitaemia within one month of observation. The AL\u00a0+\u00a0KS group significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) lowered the level of parasitaemia and MDA, and significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) maintained higher PCV than PBS group.", "The combination of A. leiocarpus and K. senegalensis showed better antitrypanosomal effects than single drug treatment and offers prospects for ATCT.
