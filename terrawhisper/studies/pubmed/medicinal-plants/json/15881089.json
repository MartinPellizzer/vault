A simple HPTLC method has been developed for the simultaneous quantification of gallic acid and ellagic acid. The method was validated for precision, repeatability, and accuracy. Instrumental precision was found to be 0.083 and 0.78, and the repeatability of the method was found to be 1.07 and 1.50 (% CV) for gallic acid and ellagic acid, respectively. The accuracy of the method was checked by a recovery study conducted at two different levels and the average percentage recovery was found to be 101.02% for gallic acid and 102.42% for ellagic acid. The above method was used for the quantification of gallic acid and ellagic acid content in seeds of Abrus precatorius Linn., whole plant of Phyllanthus maderaspatensis Linn., and flowers of Nymphaea alba Linn. The proposed HPTLC method for the simultaneous quantification of gallic acid and ellagic acid was found to be simple, precise, specific, sensitive, and accurate and can be used for routine quality control of herbal raw materials and for the quantification of these compounds in plant materials."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "B.
