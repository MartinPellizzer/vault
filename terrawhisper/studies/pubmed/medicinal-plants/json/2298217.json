In mitochondria from potato tubers both enzymes were found to be located in the outer membrane. The 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase of pea mitochondria showed the same intraorganelle localization whereas the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase behaved like a soluble protein of the intermembrane space. The sn-glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase of both potato and pea mitochondria used sn-glycerol-3-phosphate but not dihydroxyacetone phosphate as acyl acceptor and exclusively catalyzed the formation of 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate which subsequently served as substrate for the second acylation reaction at its C-2 position. Both acyltransferases of potato as well as pea mitochondria showed higher activities with acyl-CoA than with the corresponding acyl-(acyl carrier protein) thioesters. When different acyl-CoA thioesters were offered separately, the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase of potato mitochondria displayed no fatty acid specificity whereas the enzyme of pea mitochondria revealed one for saturated acyl groups. On the other hand, the mitochondrial 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferases from both potato tubers and pea leaves were more active on unsaturated than on saturated acyl-CoA thioesters. Furthermore, these enzymes preferentially used oleoyl- and linoleoyl-CoA when they were offered in a mixture with saturated ones, although the fatty acid selectivity of the pea enzyme was less pronounced than that of the potato enzyme. The sn-glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase of potato mitochondria displayed a slight preference for saturated acyl groups."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Allgemeine Botanik, Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Federal Republic of Germany."}], "LastName": "Frentzen", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Neuburger", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Joyard", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Douce", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0107600", "ISSNLinking": "0014-2956"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.1.15", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.1.51", "NameOfSubstance": "1-Acylglycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.27", "NameOfSubstance": "Thermolysin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "1-Acylglycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum tuberosum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermolysin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2298217", "10.1111/j.1432-1033.1990.tb15317.x"]}}]}
