Fourteen mineral contents (Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Sr, V and Zn) in the caps and stipes of B. edulis as well as the corresponding surface soils collected from nine different geographic regions in Yunnan Province, southwest China were determined. The analyses were performed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) after microwave digestion. Measurement data were analyzed using variance and Pearson correlation analysis. Edible safety was evaluated according to the provisionally tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) of heavy metals recommended by United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization (FAO/WHO). Mineral contents were significantly different with the variance of collection areas. B. edulis showed relative abundant contents of Ca, Fe, Mg and Na, followed by Ba, Cr, Cu, Mn and Zn, and the elements with the lower content less were Cd, Co, Ni, Sr and V. The elements accumulation differed significantly in caps and stipes. Among them, Cd and Zn were bioconcentrated (BCF > 1) while others were bioexcluded (BCF < 1). The mineral contents in B. edulis and its surface soil were positively related, indicating that the elements accumulation level was related to soil background. In addition, from the perspective of food safety, if an adult (60\u00a0kg) eats 300\u00a0g fresh B. edulis per week, the intake of Cd in most of tested mushrooms were lower than PTWI value whereas the Cd intakes in some other samples were higher than this standard. The results indicated that the main mineral contents in B. edulis were significantly different with respect to geographical distribution, and the Cd intake in a few of regions was higher than the acceptable intakes with a potential risk."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University , Kunming , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences , Kunming , China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Jiuyan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences , Kunming , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Yunnan Technical Center for Quality of Chinese Materia Medica , Kunming , China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University , Kunming , China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jieqing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d College of Resources and Environment, Yuxi Normal University , Yuxi , China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University , Kunming , China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Honggao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences , Kunming , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Yunnan Technical Center for Quality of Chinese Materia Medica , Kunming , China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuanzhong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health B", "NlmUniqueID": "7607167", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Agaricales"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microwaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29624491", "10.1080/03601234.2018.1455361"]}}]}
