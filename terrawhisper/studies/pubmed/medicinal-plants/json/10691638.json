The biphasic mixture of tert-butyl methyl ether/n-butanol/acetonitrile/water (2:2:1:5) acidified with trifluoroacetic acid was found to be a suitable solvent system for anthocyanin separation. In some cases, enrichment of the pigments on Amberlite XAD-7 resin prior to HSCCC has been carried out. The anthocyanin mixtures from red cabbage, black currant, black chokeberry, and roselle were successfully fractionated using HSCCC. Peak purity control was done by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as well as electrospray ionization ion trap multiple mass spectrometry. Finally, antioxidant activity of the purified pigments was determined using the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity test."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Lebensmittelchemie, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Schleinitzstrasse 20, 38106 Braunschweig, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Degenhardt", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Knapp", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Winterhalter", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthocyanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Anthocyanins"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Brassica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Countercurrent Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10691638", "10.1021/jf990876t", "jf990876t"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
