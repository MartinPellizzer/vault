Fertility was evaluated with mating test. Sperm motility and sperm density in cauda epididymides were also assessed. Biochemical and histological analyses were performed on blood samples and on the reproductive organs.", "S. acidum stem extract resulted in an arrest of spermatogenesis without any systemic side effect. Sperm motility as well as sperm density was reduced significantly. Treatment caused a 80% reduction in fertility at the 50 mg dose and complete suppression of fertility at the 100 mg dose. There was no significant change in RBC and WBC count, hemoglobin, haematocrit, sugar and urea in the whole blood and cholesterol, protein and phospholipid in the serum. The protein and glycogen content of the testes, fructose in the seminal vesicle and protein in epididymides were significantly decreased. Cholesterol in the testes was elevated. Treatment at both of the doses caused a marked reduction in the number of primary spermatocytes (preleptotene and pachytene), secondary spermatocytes and spermatids. The number of mature Leydig cells was decreased, and degenerating Leydig cells was increased proportionately.", "S. acidum stem extract arrests spermatogenesis in male rats without noticable side effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, University of Rajasthan, Jaipur, India. pramod@cswri.raj.nic.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Venma", "ForeName": "Pramod Kumar", "Initials": "PK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Anita", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mathur", "ForeName": "Annu", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Prachi", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Joshi", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dixit", "ForeName": "V P", "Initials": "VP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Asian J Androl", "NlmUniqueID": "100942132", "ISSNLinking": "1008-682X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents, Male"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-79-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents, Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Leydig Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatogenesis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11907627"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
