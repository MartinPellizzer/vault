Fructus Ligustri lucidi is the fruit of Ligustrum lucidum and has been used for its tonic effects on the liver. This study was designed to examine the effects of Fructus Ligustri lucidi water extract (FLL) against severe oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairment in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro and to elucidate its cellular mechanisms of action. Treatment of HepG2 cells with arachidonic acid (AA)\u00a0+\u00a0iron successfully induced oxidative stress and apoptosis, as indicated by depletion of glutathione, formation of ROS, decreses in mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8m), and altered expression of apoptosis-related proteins, such as procaspase-3 and Bcl-xL. FLL treatment significantly blocked these pathological changes and the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by AA\u00a0+\u00a0iron, which were similar with the effect of aminoimidazole-carboxamide-\u03b2-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR). Moreover, FLL induced the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which was mediated by its upstream kinase LKB1. Inhibition or activation of AMPK revealed the role of AMPK in cellular protection conferred by FLL in LKB1-deficient cells. In mice, oral administration of 100\u00a0mg/kg FLL activated AMPK in the liver, and protected against oxidative stress and liver injury induced by CCl<sub>4</sub> injection. Among the components of FLL, chlorogenic acid was found to be responsible for the protection of hepatocytes against AA\u00a0+\u00a0iron-induced cellular damage. Overall, our results confirmed that FLL has the ability to protect hepatocytes against oxidative injury through regulation of the AMPK signaling pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
