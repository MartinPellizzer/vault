The alpha-fucosidase has a molecular mass of 20 kDa according to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The alpha-fucosidase has an isoelectric point of 5.5. The substrate specificity of the alpha-fucosidase was determined by high performance anion exchange chromatographic analysis of oligosaccharide substrates and products. The enzyme hydrolyzes the terminal alpha-1,2-fucosidic linkage of oligosaccharides and does not cleave p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-fucoside. The enzyme does not release measurable amounts of fucosyl residues from large polysaccharides. The subcellular localization of alpha-fucosidase in pea stems and leaves has been studied by immunogold cytochemistry. The alpha-fucosidase accumulates in primary cell walls and is not detectable in the middle lamella or in the cytoplasm of 8-day-old stem tissue and 14-day-old leaf tissue. alpha-Fucosidase activity was readily detected in extracts of 8-day-old stem tissue. No significant alpha-fucosidase activity or immunogold labeling of the alpha-fucosidase was detected in 2- and 4-day-old stem tissue indicating that production of alpha-fucosidase is developmentally regulated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, University of Georgia, Athens 30602."}], "LastName": "Augur", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Benhamou", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Darvill", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Albersheim", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant J", "NlmUniqueID": "9207397", "ISSNLinking": "0960-7412"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37294-28-3", "NameOfSubstance": "xyloglucan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.51", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-L-Fucosidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibody Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Wall"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xylans"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-L-Fucosidase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8220450", "10.1046/j.1365-313x.1993.t01-24-00999.x"]}}]}
