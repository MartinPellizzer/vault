Many of them tend to accumulate in organs and tissues and have allergic and toxicological effects and side effects. Therefore, the purpose of our research was to conduct a comparative analysis of the antibacterial effect of Artemisia lerchiana against other herbal preparations. A. lerchiana was used in the form of an infusion and essential oil extract to fulfill the set goal and objectives. For comparative analysis, tinctures of A. absinthium, Calendula officinalis L., and Chamomilla recutita L., as well as preparations based on Abies Sibirica, Eucalyptus, Limon, Bergamottae, Melaleuca alternifolia, and A. absinthium essential oils were used. As a test standard for comparing antibacterial properties, we used the Septarius chemical preparation manufactured at a biofactory. The experiment was carried out in vitro using test microbes of gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus and gram-negative Escherichia coli. The results of the study showed that A. lerchiana had a high antibacterial effect against gram-positive test microbes (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus). The most effective form was A. lerchiana in the form of essential oil, which had an antibacterial effect even in low concentrations. A comparative assessment of A. lerchiana with the Septarius test antiseptic showed that A. lerchiana had a similar effect in general. In the form of essential oil, it even surpassed the effect of Septarius. It was found that A. lerchiana surpassed medicinal plants used in the experiment in terms of antibacterial effect. The obtained results of the study will be useful for scientists researching various medicinal products of plant origin and for veterinary specialists looking for therapeutic and preventive measures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8113-1912"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Non-profit JSC, Zhangir Khan West Kazakhstan Agrarian Technical University, Uralsk, Republic of Kazakhstan."}], "LastName": "Nametov", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1990-570X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Non-profit JSC, Zhangir Khan West Kazakhstan Agrarian Technical University, Uralsk, Republic of Kazakhstan."}], "LastName": "Yertleuova", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6736-0498"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kazakh National Agrarian Research University, Almaty, Republic of Kazakhstan."}], "LastName": "Orynkhanov", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8266-5900"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Krasnodar Research Centre for Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, Krasnodar, Russia."}], "LastName": "Semenenko", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6471-3737"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Non-profit JSC, Zhangir Khan West Kazakhstan Agrarian Technical University, Uralsk, Republic of Kazakhstan."}], "LastName": "Sidikhov", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8827-6444"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Non-profit JSC, Zhangir Khan West Kazakhstan Agrarian Technical University, Uralsk, Republic of Kazakhstan."}], "LastName": "Murzabayev", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7564-2089"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Non-profit JSC, Zhangir Khan West Kazakhstan Agrarian Technical University, Uralsk, Republic of Kazakhstan."}], "LastName": "Dushayeva", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7344-5479"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Non-profit JSC, Zhangir Khan West Kazakhstan Agrarian Technical University, Uralsk, Republic of Kazakhstan."}], "LastName": "Ichshanova", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2844-5517"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Non-profit JSC, Zhangir Khan West Kazakhstan Agrarian Technical University, Uralsk, Republic of Kazakhstan."}], "LastName": "Marat", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101129542", "ISSNLinking": "1519-6984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "55"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "25"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "38"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37971091", "10.1590/1519-6984.277641", "S1519-69842023000101005"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
