Due to complex matrix interference and the difficulty of signal enrichment, there is an urgent need for a convenient, fast, and ultrasensitive method that detects trace atrazine without concern for matrix effects. Here, we provide the first account of a sensitive and rapid suspension probe based on magnetic microspheres used to detect atrazine in herbs. The self-made magnetic beads featured -COOH groups and were used as the carrier to construct immunofluorescent probes. These probes then conjugated with the atrazine antigen through an activated ester method, ultimately binding to the antibody. Homogeneous detection was ensured using flow cytometry and the microflow optical channel along with allophycocyanin-conjugated goat-anti-mouse secondary antibody (APC-IgG-SecAb) as the fluorescent signal. The magnetic suspension probe allowed for high target enrichment and the inherent two-dimensional selective detection of flow cytometry effectively avoided any matrix interference. This method had good linearity across 1.69-23.19 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>. The IC<sub>50</sub> and LOD values were 4.81 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> and 0.95 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively; the sensitivity was increased three-fold relative to ELISA. After complete optimization, 2-N-morpholinoeth-anesulfonic acid was used as the coupling solution and maintained good mono-dispersity, stability, and reactivity for the labelled microspheres during the process. The entire experiment was simple, and effectively used reagents; moreover, both the labor required and detection time were greatly reduced. Critically, the strategy presented here greatly reduced interference from complex matrices, and saved preparation for matrix-matched solutions when different herbs were screened. Overall, this strategy was sensitive, rapid, eco-friendly, and labor-saving; collectively, these attributes make it well-suited for on-site screening of atrazine contamination and will allow for increased food safety."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
