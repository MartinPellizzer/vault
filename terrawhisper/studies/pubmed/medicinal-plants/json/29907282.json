Moreover, application of ESI-TOF-MS with a simple in source type of fragmentation and high mass accuracy measurements (around 2\u202fppm) in both positive and negative ionization modes with different and optimized fragmentor voltages, enabled the identification of each single compound based on proposed fragmentation patterns. In this way a total number of 14 compounds in methanolic and water-methanolic (1:1, v/v) extract from fruits of Eryngium amethystinum and 6 compounds in extract from fruits of E.\u00a0planum have been identified for the first time. Additionally, two dimensional thin layer chromatography/high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray-ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TLC/HPLC/ESI-TOF-MS) system was developed for identification of compounds with the highest anti-radical activity revealed in TLC-DPPH bioauthographic test. This on-line procedure enables significant improvement in terms of efficiency and faster structural analysis of the potential antioxidant natural compounds directly in the plant extracts screened for bioactivity tests. This effect - directed analysis (EDA) method enables separation, identification and preliminary screening of plant extracts for anti-radical properties and can be easily adopted for other bioactivities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
