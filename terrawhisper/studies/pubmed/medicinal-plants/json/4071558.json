Total aqueous extracts of ripe betel nuts of unprocessed and processed varieties were administered to pregnant animals at dose levels of 1, 3 and 5 mg/day/mouse (27 +/- 1 g body wt) through days 6-15 of gestation. The dams were sacrificed prior to term and the fetuses were examined for morphological, visceral and skeletal anomalies. The treatments resulted in increased resorptions as well as dead fetuses. Fetal weight was adversely affected as indicated by the dose related reduction in average body weight of live fetuses. No major morphological, visceral and skeletal defects, apart from hematomas, curved tails and a few incidences of rib anomalies, were observed. There was, however, a dose-related decrease in the number of fetuses possessing ossified coccygeal vertebrae while an increase in the number of fetuses with unossified 5th metacarpals. This indicated a delay in skeletal maturity, particularly in those fetuses exposed prenatally to the betel nut extract of the unprocessed variety."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sinha", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Toxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "0361055", "ISSNLinking": "0300-483X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abnormalities, Drug-Induced"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Embryonic and Fetal Development"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Fetal Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fetal Resorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fetus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maternal-Fetal Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nuts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4071558", "10.1016/0300-483x(85)90095-2", "0300-483X(85)90095-2"]}}]}
