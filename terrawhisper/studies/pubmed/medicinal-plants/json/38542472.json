Gene expression pattern analysis plays a crucial role in this research, as it enables us to understand the regulatory mechanism of gene expression and the associated biological processes. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) is an efficient method to analyze the gene expression patterns, for which accuracy relies on the standardized analysis of reference genes. However, numerous studies have shown that no reference gene is universal in all conditions, so screening a suitable reference gene under certain conditions is of great importance. <i>Cinnamomum burmannii</i> (<i>C. burmannii</i>) is rich in volatile components and has high medicinal and economic value. However, knowledge of the screening of reference genes for the gene expression analysis of <i>C. burmannii</i> is insufficient. Aiming at this problem, we evaluated and screened the reference genes in <i>C. burmannii</i> under different experimental conditions, including different abiotic stresses (Cold-treated, PEG-treated and Nacl-treated), different tissues, leaves at different developmental stages and different chemical types. In this study, different algorithms (\u2206Ct, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper) were used to evaluate the stability of the candidate reference genes, and RefFinder further merged the output data to screen out the optimum reference gene under various experimental conditions in <i>C. burmannii</i>. The results showed that the optimal reference gene number for gene standardization was 2 under different experimental conditions. <i>RPL27</i>|<i>RPS15</i> was the most suitable combination under the Nacl-treated and PEG-treated samples. <i>RPL27</i>|<i>APT</i> was the optimum combination under the Cold-treated samples. The optimal combinations of other samples were <i>EF1\u03b1</i>|<i>ACT7</i> for different tissues, <i>eIF</i>-<i>5A</i>|<i>Gll\u03b1</i> for different borneol clones in <i>C. burmannii</i>, <i>RPS15</i>|<i>ACT7</i> for leaves at different developmental stages and <i>RPS15</i>|<i>TATA</i> for all samples. Additionally, two terpenoid synthesis-related genes (<i>CbWRKY4</i> and <i>CbDXS2</i>) were standardized to verify the feasibility of the selected reference genes under different experimental conditions. This study will be helpful for the subsequent molecular genetic mechanism study of <i>C. burmannii</i>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, National Engineering Laboratory for Tree Breeding, Key Laboratory of Genetics and Breeding in Forest Trees and Ornamental Plants, Ministry of Education, Tree and Ornamental Plant Breeding and Biotechnology Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing 100083, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Silviculture, Protection and Utilization, Guangdong Academy of Forestry, Guangzhou 510520, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Lingling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, National Engineering Laboratory for Tree Breeding, Key Laboratory of Genetics and Breeding in Forest Trees and Ornamental Plants, Ministry of Education, Tree and Ornamental Plant Breeding and Biotechnology Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing 100083, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Silviculture, Protection and Utilization, Guangdong Academy of Forestry, Guangzhou 510520, China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Yanling", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Silviculture, Protection and Utilization, Guangdong Academy of Forestry, Guangzhou 510520, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Silviculture, Protection and Utilization, Guangdong Academy of Forestry, Guangzhou 510520, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Silviculture, Protection and Utilization, Guangdong Academy of Forestry, Guangzhou 510520, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Boxiang", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3043-2464"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, National Engineering Laboratory for Tree Breeding, Key Laboratory of Genetics and Breeding in Forest Trees and Ornamental Plants, Ministry of Education, Tree and Ornamental Plant Breeding and Biotechnology Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing 100083, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Shanzhi", "Initials": "S"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "NO. 2020KJCX001 to BH", "Agency": "Science and Technology Program from Forestry Administration of Guangdong Province", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int J Mol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101092791", "ISSNLinking": "1422-0067"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "451W47IQ8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamomum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "19"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38542472", "10.3390/ijms25063500", "ijms25063500"]}}]}
