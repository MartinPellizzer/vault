There are two types of digitalis intoxication: one that appears as a complication of the treatment with digitalis, and the other as a result of an accidental ingestion or in suicide attempt. The objective of this study was to review and assess the level of scientific evidence on the effectiveness and the indications of use of Fab fragments of antidigoxine antibodies.", "A systematic bibliographic search in the following databases was made: MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, The Iowa Drug Information Service, Embase, LMS/R&D Insight, and Indice M\u00e9dico Espa\u00f1ol. The selected papers were classified according to their level of scientific evidence.", "Abstracts of 252 references were reviewed. In the reviewed bibliography no controlled, randomized trials were found. Most of the studies found are descriptions of case series or single cases that were treated with antidigoxin Fab fragments. These types of studies provide little or no scientific evidence to speak of. None of the treatment regimes with antidigoxin antibody Fab fragments so far proposed have proven to be valid in a controlled, randomized clinical trial.", "There is a very high level of concordance among the studies reviewed with regards to the efficacy and the indications for the use of Fab fragments in severe acute accidental digitalis intoxication and in suicide attempts. Regarding those intoxications that result in patients undergoing digitalis therapy, usual therapeutic approach is traditional treatment and the monitorization of the severity of the intoxication."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agencia de Evaluaci\u00f3n de Tecnolog\u00edas Sanitarias de Andaluc\u00eda, Sevilla. vga@csalud.junta-andalucia.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonz\u00e1lez Andr\u00e9s", "ForeName": "V L", "Initials": "VL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Systematic Review"], "VernacularTitle": "Revisi\u00f3n sistem\u00e1tica sobre la efectividad e indicaciones de los anticuerpos antidigoxina en la intoxicaci\u00f3n digit\u00e1lica."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Spain", "MedlineTA": "Rev Esp Cardiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0404277", "ISSNLinking": "0300-8932"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "73K4184T59", "NameOfSubstance": "Digoxin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Digoxin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Poisoning"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10701323", "10.1016/s0300-8932(00)75063-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
