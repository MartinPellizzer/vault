The drugs widely used in clinic are mainly single-target drugs for symptomatic treatment, which can only alleviate symptoms to a certain extent. Ecliptae Herba (EH) is considered a potential therapeutic drug for AD due to its neuroprotective effects. Although EH has a clear anti-AD effect, the material basis and mechanism remain unclear. Therefore, we adopted an efficient analytical technique, namely ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS), combined with \"component-target-pathway\" network to explore the active components and potential mechanisms of EH in treating AD. Due to the high sensitivity of UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, a total of 50 components were identified in EH. Among them, 20 and 12 compounds were found in plasma and brain samples, respectively. The network pharmacology analysis revealed that apigenin, luteolin, ecliptasaponin A, chlorogenic acid, wedelolactone, and quercetin were the active components, which could affect the serotonergic synapse, calcium and cAMP signaling pathways by regulating related targets such as EGFR, PRKCA, BRAF and ERBB2. This study clarified that EH can exert anti-AD effect through multi-component, multi-target and multi-pathway characteristics. Furthermore, it offers a good foundation for further in-depth research on the anti-AD effects of EH, and provides a valuable approach for the rapid screening of active components and potential mechanisms of other medicinal plants, potentially bringing changes to the discovery and development of novel therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
