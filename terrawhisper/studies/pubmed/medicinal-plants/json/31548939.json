This study was designed to determine the effect of mint aroma on nausea, vomiting, and anxiety in pregnant women.", "This quasi-experimental interventional study was carried out on 66 pregnant women, with a range from the mild to moderate nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, who were admitted to the prenatal care unit. During one week, twice a day, samples in mint and placebo groups, used mint and sesame oil, respectively. Rhodes nausea and vomiting questionnaire and state anxiety inventory scale (STAI) (Spiel Berger) was completed by all mothers before and after the intervention.", "After intervention, there was a significant difference in the overall mean score of Rhodes index (<i>P</i> < 0.001), also in the severity of nausea and vomiting (<i>P</i> < 0.016) between the two groups, but not in the overall mean score and severity of maternal state anxiety (MSA). In both groups, the mean of Rhodes index score and MSA was significantly decreased after intervention (<i>P</i> < 0.001).", "The results showed that mint aroma can be effective in reducing nausea and vomiting of pregnancy without any effect on state anxiety."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Nursing and Midwifery, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amzajerdi", "ForeName": "Azam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery and Reproductive Health, School of Nursing and Midwifery/Nursing Care Research Center (NCRC), Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Keshavarz", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mental Health Research, Health Metrics Research Center, Iranian Institute for Health Sciences Research, ACECR, Kashan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Montazeri", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Barij Medicinal Plants Research Center, Kashan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bekhradi", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Family Med Prim Care", "NlmUniqueID": "101610082", "ISSNLinking": "2249-4863"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Cunningham FG, Leveno KJ, Bloom SL, Spong CY, Dashe JS, Hoffman BL, et al. 25th ed.
