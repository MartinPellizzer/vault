But the content of chlorogen acid in the buds treated by 80% irrigation volume was not affected, while that of the other treatment all decreased. The moisture contents of the leaves treated by 30% irrigation volume was significantly lower than that of the CK, while the specific leaf weight (SLW) increased significantly comparing to the CK. The content of chlorophyl in the leaves of 50% and 30% increased, while the ratio of chlorophyl A and B fell significantly. The content of dissoluble suger in the leaves of 80% and 50% irrigation volume was much higher than that in the CK. The results also showed that, the content of dissoluble protein in the leaves of 30% irrigation volume increased comparing with that in 50%, and the content of proline in leaveas of 30% irrigation volume increased significantly.", "Using less irrigation volume (keeping 80% of relative moisture content of the soil) does not affect the quality of honeysuckle, but decreased dry weight of honeysuckle.
