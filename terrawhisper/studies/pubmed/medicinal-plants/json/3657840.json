SCE and EA were induced by UV light and quinacrine mustard. Between the lines SCE frequencies were not different. The background level of SCE was doubled after UV irradiation and 4 times higher after exposure to quinacrine mustard in all Vicia lines analysed. However, the induced frequencies of EA were found to be different under the same treatment conditions for the standard line and the oligochiasmatic mutants. Between the frequencies of induced EA and the frequencies of chiasmata a correlation could be shown. The relationship between the formation of SCE and EA due to the reduced ability of meiotic recombination in the mutants of Vicia faba is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Angewandte Genetik, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, West Germany."}], "LastName": "Vogel", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Friebe", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "4213-45-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinacrine Mustard"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H0C805XYDE", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinacrine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Crossing Over, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Quinacrine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quinacrine Mustard"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Recombination, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sister Chromatid Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3657840", "10.1016/0165-7992(87)90107-2", "0165-7992(87)90107-2"]}}]}
