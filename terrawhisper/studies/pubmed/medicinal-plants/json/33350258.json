After more than 30 years of development, a large number of data, including text data, image data and other types, have been generated in the modern research on Dao-di herbs. It has the characteristics of large quantity, variety, scattered content and different structure, and the data types of each feature are isolated or less interrelated. Based on the literature published in CNKI journal database since 1999-2019, the data collection, selection and collation of 34 kinds of Dao-di herbs characteristics, micro characteristics, ecological characteristics and genetic characteristics were carried out. Using the knowledge base construction technology and combining these characteristics of the characteristics data of the herbs, the above characteristics data were standardized and regarded as a part of the knowledge base of the herbs. Based on a large number of data, this paper analyzes the knowledge composition, research status, comparison between modern and traditional producing areas of traditional Chinese medicine, and takes Salvia miltiorrhiza as an example to compare the ecological characteristics of modern and traditional producing areas. The construction of the knowledge base will facilitate the mining and utilization of the scientific data of Dao-di herbs, and provide resource management and basic guarantee for the transformation and promotion of scientific and technological achievements of Dao-di herbs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Hu-Biao", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Information on Traditional Chinese Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan-Bai", "ForeName": "L I", "Initials": "LI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Hua-Sheng", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Lu-Qi", "ForeName": "Huang", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Knowledge Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33350258", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190727.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
