B16 cells were assigned to the normal, blank, and negative control, miR-708 mimics, miR-708 inhibitors, si-BAMBI, and miR-708 inhibitors + si-bone morphogenetic protein and activin membrane-bound inhibitor groups. Western blotting and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction were employed to detect the expression levels within the tissues and cell lines. TCF luciferase reporter (TOP-FLASH) or a control vector (FOP-FLASH) was applied to detect the activity of the Wnt signaling pathway. MTT3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, flow cytometry, scratch test, and Transwell assay were conducted, respectively, for cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion, while tumor xenograft procedures were performed on the nude mice recruited for the study.", "Compared to the normal control group, the model group displayed increased expressions of bone morphogenetic protein and activin membrane-bound inhibitor, Wnt10B, P53, and Bcl-2; TOPflash activity; \u03b2-catenin expression; cell proliferation; migration; and invasion capabilities while decreased expressions of miR-708, vascular endothelial growth factor, Fas, Bax, Caspase-3, and cleaved Caspase-3 and apoptosis rate. Compared to the blank and negative control groups, the miR-708 mimics and small-interfering RNA-bone morphogenetic protein and activin membrane-bound inhibitor groups exhibited decreases expressions of bone morphogenetic protein and activin membrane-bound inhibitor, Wnt10B, P53, and Bcl-2 and decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion capabilities, while increases in the apoptosis rate, expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor, Fas, Bax, Caspase-3, and cleaved Caspase-3; however, downregulated levels of TOPflash activity and \u03b2-catenin expression were recorded.
