Mitochondrial injury has been observed in liver cells exposed to BDE-47 in\u00a0vitro. Mitophagy impairment causes the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, contributing to the pathological mechanisms of liver injury. The aim of this study was to investigate whether BDE-47 impairs mitophagy to trigger mitochondrial dysfunction-related liver injury and the underlying mechanisms. This study revealed that BDE-47 elicited mitochondrial dysfunction and related oxidative liver injury by impairing mitophagy. Moreover, our results showed that NAD<sup>+</sup> insufficiency is responsible for BDE-47-mediated mitophagy defect and mitochondrial dysfunction in mouse livers, which was associated with suppression of Sirt3/FoxO3a/PINK1 signaling. Furthermore, our results indicated a potential role of miR-34a-5p in the hepatotoxicity of BDE-47. Mechanistically, BDE-47 dramatically upregulated miR-34a-5p expression in mouse livers. The data from AAV-sponge-mediated miR-34a-5p inhibition suggested that miR-34a-5p diminished NAD<sup>+</sup> level by directly targeting NAMPT expression in BDE-47-treated mouse livers, which was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. Consequently, miR-34a-5p markedly abated Sirt3/FoxO3a/PINK1 signaling-mediated mitophagy to promote mitochondrial dysfunction in BDE-47-treated mouse livers. The present study provided in\u00a0vivo evidence to reveal a potential mechanism for BDE-47-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and related liver injury and indicated that miR-34a-5p-mediated mitophagy impairment might be a therapeutic target for BDE-47 toxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
