This study was to evaluate the effect of cellular immune supportive treatment on cellular immunity of patients with esophageal carcinoma.", "A total of 60 patients with thoracic esophageal carcinoma, received two-field dissection, were randomized into control group and trial (immune supportive treatment) group. The patients in trial group were injected with Shenqi injection after operation; the patients in control group received no immune supportive treatment. Peripheral blood samples were obtained before operation, and 3 and 9 days after operation. AgNOR (argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions) activity in peripheral blood T lymphocytes was measured by tumor immune microphotometry. T cell subsets were measured by flow cytometry.", "The proportions of CD3+CD4+ and CD4+/CD8+ cells were significantly higher in trial group than in control group at 3 days after operation (P < 0.05). The amount of AgNOR and proportions of CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD4+/CD8+, and CD4+CD25+ cells were significantly higher in trial group than in control group at 9 days after operation (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in 1-year survival rate between the 2 groups (P > 0.05).", "Shenqi injection could obviously improve cellular immunity of the esophageal carcinoma patients after modern two-field dissection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Skate Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, P.
