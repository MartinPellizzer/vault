However, few studies have explored the molecular mechanisms of bibenzyl biosynthesis. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of DsBBS1 and DsBBS2 function in <i>D. sinense</i>. A molecular docking simulation revealed high-resolution three-dimensional structural models with minor domain orientation differences. Expression analyses of <i>DsBBS1</i> and <i>DsBBS2</i> across various tissues indicated a consistent pattern, with the highest expression being found in the roots, implying that they play a pivotal role in bibenzyl biosynthesis. Protein expression studies identified optimal conditions for DsBBS2-HisTag expression and purification, resulting in a soluble protein with a molecular weight of approximately 45 kDa. Enzyme activity assays confirmed DsBBS2's capacity to synthesize resveratrol, exhibiting higher V<sub>max</sub> and lower K<sub>m</sub> values than DsBBS1. Functional analyses in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> demonstrated that both DsBBS1 and DsBBS2 could complement the <i>Atchs</i> mutant phenotype. The total flavonoid content in the <i>DsBBS1</i> and <i>DsBBS2</i> transgenic lines was restored to wild-type levels, while the total bibenzyl content increased. DsBBS1 and DsBBS2 are capable of catalyzing both bibenzyl and flavonoid biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. This study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of bibenzyl compounds in <i>D. sinense</i>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Genetics and Germplasm Innovation of Tropical Special Forest Trees and Ornamental Plants-Ministry of Education, School of Tropical Agriculture and Forestry, Hainan University, Haikou 570228, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Liyan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Genetics and Germplasm Innovation of Tropical Special Forest Trees and Ornamental Plants-Ministry of Education, School of Tropical Agriculture and Forestry, Hainan University, Haikou 570228, China."}], "LastName": "You", "ForeName": "Huiyan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0008-4636-2580"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Genetics and Germplasm Innovation of Tropical Special Forest Trees and Ornamental Plants-Ministry of Education, School of Tropical Agriculture and Forestry, Hainan University, Haikou 570228, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Lixuan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Genetics and Germplasm Innovation of Tropical Special Forest Trees and Ornamental Plants-Ministry of Education, School of Tropical Agriculture and Forestry, Hainan University, Haikou 570228, China."}], "LastName": "Ou", "ForeName": "Qiongjian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Genetics and Germplasm Innovation of Tropical Special Forest Trees and Ornamental Plants-Ministry of Education, School of Tropical Agriculture and Forestry, Hainan University, Haikou 570228, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Genetics and Germplasm Innovation of Tropical Special Forest Trees and Ornamental Plants-Ministry of Education, School of Tropical Agriculture and Forestry, Hainan University, Haikou 570228, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3499-394X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Genetics and Germplasm Innovation of Tropical Special Forest Trees and Ornamental Plants-Ministry of Education, School of Tropical Agriculture and Forestry, Hainan University, Haikou 570228, China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "32160400", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "320RC469", "Agency": "Collaborative Innovation Center project of Hainan University", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "KYQD(ZR)-22056", "Agency": "Hainan University Research Project", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Molecules", "NlmUniqueID": "100964009", "ISSNLinking": "1420-3049"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bibenzyls"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bibenzyls"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39125085", "10.3390/molecules29153682", "molecules29153682"]}}]}
