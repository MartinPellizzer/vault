Samples in each group consisted of 30 members. The first group received 1 daily dose of 100 mg coenzyme Q10 capsules and the second group received a placebo treatment. Treatment in both groups lasted 12 weeks. Before and after the intervention of semen analysis, hormonal measurement of testosterone, prolactin, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were done. Sexual function was assessed before and after the intervention by using the International Index of Erectile Dysfunction questionnare.", "The mean age of participants was 34.07 (5.26) years in the CoQ10 group and 34.83 (6.22) in the placebo one. Normal volume of semen (P=0.10), viscosity (P=0.55), sperm count (P=0.28), and sperm motility (P=0.33) in the CoQ10 group increased without statistically significant differences. But the normal sperm morphology increased with statistically significant differences in the CoQ10 group (P=0.01). There was an increase in normal FSH levels and testosterone levels in the CoQ10 group compared with the placebo patients, but these differences were not statistically significant (respectively P=0.58, P=0.61). The results also revealed that the scores of erectile function (P=0.95), orgasm (P=0.86), satisfaction with sexual intercourse (P=0.61), overall satisfaction (P=0.69) and the score of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF, P=0.82) were greater after the intervention in the CoQ10 group than in the placebo group although the difference was not statistically significant.", "The use of CoQ10 supplement can improve sperm morphology; however, in other sperm parameters and also in some hormones increased after the intervention, this was not statistically significant and therefore the result is not conclusive (registration number: IRCT20120215009014N322)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mother and Child Care Research Center, Department of Midwifery and Reproductive Health, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Gharakhani Bahar", "ForeName": "Tayebeh", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mother and Child Care Research Center, Department of Midwifery and Reproductive Health, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Masoumi", "ForeName": "Seyedeh Zahra", "Initials": "SZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endometrium and Endometriosis Research Center, Medicine School, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Pilehvari", "ForeName": "Shamim", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mother and Child Care Research Center, Department of Midwifery and Reproductive Health, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kazemi", "ForeName": "Farideh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moradkhani", "ForeName": "Shirin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahmoudi", "ForeName": "Shokoufeh", "Initials": "S"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "IRCT", "AccessionNumberList": ["IRCT20120215009014N322"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Int J Fertil Steril", "NlmUniqueID": "101487941", "ISSNLinking": "2008-0778"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Ben Rafael Z.
