There has therefore been a need to identify the key immune and autophagy genes that respond to M.nipponense's infection with S. eriocheiris to analyze its immune response mechanism and the regulation of related microRNAs (miRNAs). In this study, the mRNA and miRNA transcriptome of M.nipponense's hemocytes were analyzed at different stages of infection. This analysis employed the second and third-generation sequencing technologies. In the mRNA transcriptome, 1656 genes were expressed in healthy and susceptible M.nipponense. 892 of these were significantly up-regulated, while 764 were down-regulated. 118 genes with significant differences in autophagy, endocytosis, lysosome, Toll, IMD, and VEGF pathways were obtained from the transcriptome. In the miRNA transcriptome, 312 miRNAs (Conserved: 112, PN-type: 18, PC-type: 182) were sequenced. 74 were significantly up-regulated, and 57 were down-regulated. There were 25 miRNAs involved in regulating the Toll and IMD pathways, 41 in endocytosis, 30 in lysosome, and 12 in the VEGF pathway. An integrated analysis of immune-related miRNAs and mRNAs showed that miRNAs with significant differences (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) such as ame-miR-29b-3p, dpu-miR-1and PC-3p-945_4074, had corresponding regulatory relationships with 118 important immune genes such as Relish, Dorsal, Caspase-3, and NF-\u03baB. This study obtained the key immune and autophagy-related genes and corresponding regulatory miRNAs in M. nipponense's hemocytes in response to an infection by S.eriocheiris. The results can provide vital data that further reveals the defense mechanism of M.nipponense's immune system against S.eriocheiris. It can also help further comprehension and interpretation of M.nipponense's resistance mechanism to the invading S.eriocheiris, and provide molecular research information for the realization of host-directed therapies (HDT) for M.nipponense."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
