Approximately 6.1% were underweight, 12.1% overweight, and 0.9% obese, and all age groups were affected.

Besides, 6% of them had a low dietary intake, 21% had a poorly diversified diet, and 2% were highly food insecure. The students' daily macronutrient intake was within the recommended reference values, except for carbohydrates, which exceeded and represented 62.69\u00b1\u200913.84% of daily energy intake.
