Amid the important members of this genus, A. nilotica and A. ataxacantha are widely employed for their tremendous healing properties. Hence, this present work aimed to determine the total phenolic and flavonoid contents and investigate the antioxidant, antiproliferative, anti-enzyme and antimicrobial potentials of methanolic and water extracts of leaves and stem bark of A. nilotica and A. ataxacantha obtained by maceration and ultrasonication. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents were obtained in the range of 33.35-116.60\u00a0mg GAE/g and 0.26-49.90\u00a0mg RE/g, respectively, with the methanolic leaf extracts of both species showing the highest contents. Moreover, the methanolic extracts were observed to display higher antioxidant potentials in almost all antioxidant assays performed compared to the water extracts (ABTS: 52.66-943.81\u00a0mg\u00a0TE/g, DPPH: 8.51-493.90\u00a0mg\u00a0TE/g, CUPRAC: 106.39-1193.75\u00a0mg\u00a0TE/g; FRAP: 31.38-416.21\u00a0mg\u00a0TE/g, and phosphomolybdenum: 0.90-4.17\u00a0mM\u00a0TE/g). However, the water extracts were seen to be better metal chelators than the methanolic extracts (8.47-36.85\u00a0mg EDTAE/g). Additionally, all extracts were found to exhibit anti-tyrosinase (30.79-74.80\u00a0mg KAE/g) and anti-amylase (0.10-1.10\u00a0mM ACAE/g) properties. With the exception of a few extracts, glucosidase and acetylcholinesterase inhibitions (1.69-2.12\u00a0mg ACAE/g and 0.42-2.61\u00a0mg GALAE/g, respectively) were also demonstrated. While the methanolic extracts of both species showed antimicrobial potency against all the 18 tested microorganisms (gram positive, gram negative, and fungi), the water extracts were effective only against the gram positive bacteria. The extracts were also found to exhibit antiproliferative effects on SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, with the methanolic extracts showing higher cytotoxic potential than the water extracts. Therefore, this study showed these species to be good sources of antioxidants, enzyme inhibitors, antimicrobials and antiproliferative agents, which could be of great interest for their applications as natural bioactive ingredients in the development of pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
