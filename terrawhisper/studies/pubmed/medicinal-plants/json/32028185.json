Multidrug resistance protein 2 (ABCC2/ MRP2) is an important efflux transporter of substances associated with cellular oxidative stress. However, the effects of traditional Chinese medicine on this protein remain unclear.", "The aim of this research is to study the role of ABCC2 in AE-induced hepatotoxicity.", "The expression of ABCC2 protein and mRNA levels were analyzed by Western-Blotting and qRT-PCR, respectively. The intracellular oxidative stress caused by AE was evaluated by quantifying the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, glutathione reduced and oxidized glutathione. The levels of adenosine triphosphate, mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial DNA were explored to evaluate the effects of AE on mitochondrial function. The effects of AE on cell apoptosis and cell cycle were detected by flow cytometry. To further clarify the key role of ABCC2 in AE induced cytotoxicity, we used pCI-neo-ABCC2 plasmid to over express ABCC2 protein, and small interfering RNA was used to knockdown ABCC2 in HepG2 cells. Additionally, we investigated the impact of AE on ABCC2 degradation pathway and the hepatotoxic effects of AE in mice.", "AE was found to inhibit ABCC2 transport activity, downregulate ABCC2 expression and altered intracellular redox balance. Induction of oxidative stress resulted in depletion of intracellular glutathione reduced, mitochondria dysfunction and activation of apoptosis. ABCC2 overexpression significantly reduced AE-induced intracellular oxidative stress and cell death, which was enhanced by ABCC2 knockdown. Furthermore, AE was observed to promote ABCC2 degradation through induction of autophagy and hepatotoxicity was induced in mice by promoting ABCC2 degradation.", "The inhibition of ABCC2 is a novel effect of AE that triggers oxidative stress and apoptosis. These findings are helpful in understanding the toxicological effects of AE-containing medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier GmbH.
