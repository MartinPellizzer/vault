Eventually antibiotics were designed to eradicate this bacterium, which not only prevent peptic ulcer recurrence but also decrease the chances of developing gastric cancer. Propitious consequences of these antibiotic regimens and better hygienic conditions, particularly in developed countries, resulted in significant decline in the prevalence of H. pylori infection. However, persistent high H. pylori infection in developing countries, decreased patience compliance and emerging antibiotic resistance forced researchers to quest for novel candidates. Herbal medicines have always served as a leading source in drug discovery. Since time immemorial, herbs have been used to treat various disorders covering from minor illnesses as pain to life threatening conditions like cancer. Ample amount of studies from different parts of the world have shown promising activities of medicinal herbs not only against H. pylori but also associated disorders while employing in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies. In this review, these multiple pharmacological effects of medicinal plants and their chemical constituents will be discussed in relation to H. pylori not only to scientifically evaluate the beneficial effects of these medicinal plants but to also critically analyze their plausible role as chemo preventive agents against H. pylori-associated disorders."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University of Health Sciences, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia / Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama, Japan."}], "LastName": "Zaidi", "ForeName": "Syed Faisal", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama, Japan."}], "LastName": "Muhammad", "ForeName": "Jibran Sualeh", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Pharmacy and Health Care, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jinnah University for women, Block 5C, Nazimabad, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Usmanghani", "ForeName": "Khan", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama, Japan."}], "LastName": "Sugiyama", "ForeName": "Toshiro", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy", "epidemiology", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Helicobacter Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Helicobacter pylori"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26051742"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
