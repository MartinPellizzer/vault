During 2021-2022, the root rot was observed in a 20-ha commercial farm and became a major disease limiting Mongolian snake gourd production in Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province, China (119\u00b027'E, 32\u00b012'N). Field investigations showed that disease incidence was estimated at approximately 70% and resulted in up to a 50% decrease in total production. Symptoms on snake gourd initially appeared as yellow mottling produced on the surface of the infected new leaves and systemic wilting on the upper leaves. With the development of the infection, the base of the stem began to brown and die, and has lots of filamentous hyphae attached to it. As the lesions coalesced, the whole plant gradually wilted and died. In order to explore the cause of the disease, six infected plants were randomly collected from the commercial farm. The roots of the plants were rinsed in sterile water to remove soil debris, and symptomatic roots were surface sterilized using 75% ethanol for 60s, rinsed three times in sterile water, then plated onto the potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 3 days in the dark. White fungal colonies grew from the tissue pieces, then hyphal tips were transferred to PDA to obtain pure cultures. A total of six isolates with similar morphological characteristics were obtained from six of the infected plants. One representative isolate GL21091501 was chosen for further analysis. At 5 days after inoculation, the colonies on PDA began to grow as white, and with the incubated time was extended, the hyphae turned yellowish-brown with a yellowish-brown center on the reverse side. Observations under a light microscope showed conidia that were falculate, slender and slightly curved, and the cells at both ends were sharp. Macroconidia had four to five septa, measuring 22.4 ~ 33.5 \u03bcm. Microconidia without septa, elliptical, measuring 4.36 ~ 9.88 \u03bcm. On the tip of aerial hyphae can form conidiophore, and produce macroconidia (Wonglom et al. 2020; Lin et al 2018). The pathogen was typical Fusarium spp. by morphological characteristics. To identify the species level, the mycelia of the representative isolate GL21091501 was used for genomic DNA extraction (Tiangen, China). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and partial translational elongation factor subunit 1-\u03b1 (TEF-1\u03b1) of the cultures were amplified and sequenced using the primer pairs EF1/EF2 and ITS1/ITS4 respectively (White et al. 1990; O'Donnell et al. 1998). The obtained sequences were deposited in GenBank under the accesion numbers OP311409 and OP311410. BLAST searches of the deposited sequences showed 100% identity with the existing TEF sequences (MT563420.1) and ITS sequences (MN539094.1) of Fusarium incarnatum isolates in GenBank. In addition, BLASTn analysis of these in FUSARIUM-ID database showed 99.62% and 100% similarity with F. incarnatum-equiseti species complex (FIESC) NRRL13379 [ITS] and NRRL34004 [TEF-1\u03b1]), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted with the neighbor-joining (NJ) method using MEGA6.0 (Tamura et al. 2007). Combined phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolate shared a common clade with the reference sequence of F. incarnatum in the F. incarnatum-equiseti species complex. Therefore, according to morphological and molecular characteristics confirming the identity of the isolated pathogen as F. incarnatum. In order to fulfill Koch's postulates, fresh isolate GL21091501 hyphae were cut into 3 \u00d7 3 mm agar plugs from a 7 cm PDA plate and inoculated in 200 mL the Potato Dextrose (PD) liquid medium on a shaker at 170 rpm, 25\u00b0C for 5 days. Spores were filtered through four layers of gauze, adjusted to 1 \u00d7 106 spores/ml with sterilized water. Then Mongolian snake gourd seedlings at the two true leaves stage were transplanted in (15-cm-diameter) pots (1 plants/pot) filled with mixture of sterilized soil: vermiculite: pearlite (2:1:1, v/v). The pathogenicity test was conducted on seedlings plants by root irrigation method (50 ml/plant, 1\u00d7106 conidia/mL), control plants were irrigation with sterilized water (50 ml/plant). Each treatment was repeated three times. After 15 days, all inoculated plants showed the same symptoms observed on the original diseased plants in the field, whereas, the control plants remained symptomless. The same pathogen was successfully re-isolated from the inoculated plants, and identical to those of the originals based on morphological and sequence data. To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. incarnatum causing root rot on Mongolian snake gourd in China. F. incarnatum has been reported to cause root and stem rot in many plants worldwide, including muskmelon (Wonglom et al. 2020), Cucurbita pepo (Thomas et al. 2019) and Bambusa multiplex (Lin et al. 2018). This discovery is of great importance for Mongolian snake gourd planters because the fungus is accurately identified in a certain geographic area and effective field management strategies are necessary to control this disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Institute of Vegetables and Flowers, 471462, Beijing, Beijing, China; 2496566268@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Lixia", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Institute of Vegetables and Flowers, 471462, No. 12 Zhongguancun South St., Haidian District, Beijing, China, 100081; caulilei@163.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Vegetables and Flowers, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, 12 Zhongguancun South st, Haidian District, Beijing, Beijing, Beijing, China, 100081."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing, Beijing, China, 100081; shiyanxia@caas.cn."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Yanxia", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "12 Zhongguancun South Street, Haidian District, Beijing, 100081Beijing, China, 100081; chaiali@caas.cn."}], "LastName": "Chai", "ForeName": "A Li", "Initials": "AL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Institute of Vegetables and Flowers, 471462, Beijing, Beijing, China; fantengfei@caas.cn."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Tengfei", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Vegetables and Flowers, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, No. 12, Zhongguancun Nandajie, Beijing, 100081, China, Beijing, China, 100081; libaojuivf@163.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Baoju", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Vegetables and Flowers, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, Beijing, Beijing, China; xiexuewen@caas.cn."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Xuewen", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38356278", "10.1094/PDIS-07-23-1424-PDN"]}}]}
