Nigella sativa has been well known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this study was to investigate preventive effects of N. sativa on liver and renal tissue damage in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -treated rats. The rats were divided into five groups: (1) control; (2) LPS (1 mg/kg, IP, for 10 days), (3-5) N. sativa hydroethanolic extract (100, 200, or 400 mg/kg) before LPS. Compared to LPS group, treatment by the extract decreased alondialdehyde, nitric oxide (NO) metabolites, and interleukin-6 while increased thiol content and superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in both renal and liver tissues. N. sativa extract also decreased serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotrans-ferase, and alkaline phosphatase concentration, while it increased serum protein and albumin compared with LPS group. In LPS group, serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were higher than control group. The extract reversed the negative effects of LPS. The results demonstrated that the N. sativa prevented liver and renal tissue damage in LPS-treated rats. It is suggested that the effects are due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh; Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Beheshti", "ForeName": "Farimah", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Esfarayen Faculty of Medical Sciences, Esfarayen, Iran."}], "LastName": "Norouzi", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abareshi", "ForeName": "Azam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khazaei", "ForeName": "Majid", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alikhani", "ForeName": "Vajiheh", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moussavi", "ForeName": "Sussan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Biglari", "ForeName": "Ghazale", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soukhtanloo", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Saudi Arabia", "MedlineTA": "Saudi J Kidney Dis Transpl", "NlmUniqueID": "9436968", "ISSNLinking": "1319-2442"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nigella sativa"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}], "CoiStatement": "None declared"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29970731", "10.4103/1319-2442.235184", "SaudiJKidneyDisTranspl_2018_29_3_554_235184"]}}]}
