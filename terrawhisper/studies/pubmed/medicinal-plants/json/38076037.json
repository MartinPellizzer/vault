The health of the reproductive system is an important issue for women, and understanding the potential effect of garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>) for preventive and therapeutic purposes in this field is of interest. This systematic review focused on the effects of garlic on the female reproductive system. The method involved a comprehensive search of relevant literature on experimental animal studies using electronic databases from January 2010 to September 2023, followed by selection of eligible studies and data extraction. A total of 18 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. This review reported that garlic may have positive effects on women's reproductive health, such as improving hormonal balance, relieving PMS symptoms, and potentially supporting fertility outcomes. This review revealed that garlic compounds such as <i>allicin</i> and <i>ajoene</i> can modulate various aspects of the female reproductive system, including regulation of the menstrual cycle, hormonal balance, fertility, and reproductive disorders. This review determined that further research is needed to elucidate the molecular pathways and direct effects of garlic on the female reproductive system. Although garlic has many potential health benefits, it should not be used as a substitute for medications."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 The Authors."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zanjan Applied Pharmacology Research Center, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Medicine, School of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jafari", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Medicine, School of Persian Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khalilzadeh", "ForeName": "Somayyeh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Medicine, School of Persian Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Microbiology Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nejatbakhsh", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Naderie", "ForeName": "Maziar", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Heliyon", "NlmUniqueID": "101672560", "ISSNLinking": "2405-8440"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Bulavenko O., et al.
