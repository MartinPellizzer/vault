A phytochemical investigation led to the isolation of eight undescribed gentianellane-type sesterterpenoids (18-epi-nitidasin, gentianelloids D-F, and 18-epi-gentianelloids C-F), one undescribed 11,12-seco-gentianellane (18-epi-alborosin), and three known analogs (nitidasin, gentianelloid C and alborosin) among which gentianelloid C was found for the first time from a natural source. The structures of these compounds were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analyses (including 1D and 2D NMR, HRMS, IR, and specific rotation) and in the case of 18-epi-gentianelloid C by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. A putative biosynthetic route for these sesterterpenoids was proposed. The immunosuppressive activity of the isolated compounds was also evaluated by their ability to inhibit the proliferation of T cells and T cell cytokine IFN-\u03b3 production. Nitidasin suppressed IFN-\u03b3 production with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 16.50\u00a0\u03bcM, while gentianelloid F and alborosin inhibited the proliferation of and IFN-\u03b3 production in T cells with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 12.40-14.66\u00a0\u03bcM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
