In addition to their sugar binding specificity, these lectins also contain sites that bind hydrophobic ligands. The present study explores a class of nonpolar binding sites reportedly present adjacent to the carbohydrate binding site in PSA, LCH, and VFA. A series of 2-O- and 3-O-substituted nitrobenzoyl and nitrobenzyl derivatives of methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside and methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside were synthesized. Evaluation of their binding to Con A, PSA, LCH, and VFA was carried out by the technique of hapten inhibition of precipitation reaction. The hapten inhibition assay results reveal that the presence of a methyl or methylene group at the O-2 or O-3 position of the sugar is essential for hydrophobic interaction with PSA, LCH, and VFA. The substitution of methyl by nitrobenzyl leads to enhanced binding (1.7-16.7 times for the 2-O-substituted compounds and 7.9-40.5 times for the 3-O-substituted compounds) with the m-nitrobenzyl group contributing to maximum binding. A hydrophobic interaction is also involved between Con A and 2-O-nitrobenzyl derivatives, resulting in enhanced binding, but the corresponding 3-O-isomers bind poorly due probably to steric reasons. These results may be rationalized on the basis of the recently published X-ray data of Con A and VFA. The nitrobenzyl derivatives, after transformation to their azido analogs, have potential applications in the photoaffinity labeling of these lectins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109."}], "LastName": "Loganathan", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Osborne", "ForeName": "S E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Glick", "ForeName": "G D", "Initials": "GD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Goldstein", "ForeName": "I J", "Initials": "IJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM 29470", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Haptens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11028-71-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Concanavalin A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Precipitation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Physical"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Concanavalin A"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Haptens"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Monosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1444465", "10.1016/0003-9861(92)90274-z", "0003-9861(92)90274-Z"]}}]}
