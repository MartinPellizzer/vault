Leaves were collected and prepared to obtain the crude extract, which was then aliquoted and separately exposed to a Co-60 source with different doses, namely: 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, and 30\u00a0kGy. From irradiated and control samples, tests of toxicity were carried out with the microcrustacea Artemia salina Leach at three moments: 24\u00a0h, 60 and 180 days after the irradiation of the samples. Bioassays showed an increase in the toxicity of the irradiated extracts, correlated with the dose. The toxicity level did not change with the storage time, indicating the excellent stability of the samples. To assess the phytochemical profile of the crude and irradiated extracts, three techniques were employed: thin-layer chromatography (TLC), liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The phytochemical results emphasized the presence of phenols, tannins, and triterpenes. The analytical tests confirmed the role of ionizing radiation in breaking down macromolecules into simpler chemical species responsible for increasing chemical activity of the extract. This report presents and discusses ionizing radiation as an outstanding tool for enhancing active chemical compounds in leaf extracts of Libidibia ferrea, which reflects on their biochemical properties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
