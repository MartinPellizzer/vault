Traditional medicinal plant cultivation and collection have also faced with challenges, such as lack of resources, deterioration of environment, germplasm of recession and a series of problems. Genetic engineering can be used to improve the disease resistance, insect resistance, herbicides resistant ability of medicinal plant, also can improve the medicinal plant yield and increase the content of active substances in medicinal plants. Thus, the potent biotechnology can play an important role in protection and large area planting of medicinal plants. In the development of medicinal plant genetic engineering, the safety of transgenic medicinal plants should also be paid attention to. A set of scientific safety evaluation and judgment standard which is suitable for transgenic medicinal plants should be established based on the recognition of the particularity of medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Teng", "ForeName": "Zhong-qiu", "Initials": "ZQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26137675"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
