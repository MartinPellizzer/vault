The plants from the genus Viola are used to treat various diseases and exert a significant role in protecting people's health. This review summarized the genus Viola plants' phytochemistry, pharmacology, and quality control methods.", "The information on chemical constituents and pharmacological effects of the genus Viola was obtained by searching the Web of Science, Pubmed, CNKI, and other databases. A total of 208 valuable articles were selected and analyzed in this review. The main chemical components of plants from the genus Viola consist of flavonoids, coumarins, alkaloids, lignans, sesquiterpenes, cyclotides, etc. The active chemical components of medicinal plants from this genus exert antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective activities, and so on.
