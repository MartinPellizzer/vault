Investigation and sampling investigation combined with interview were carried out. The total reserve of resources was estimated through route-quadrat method in combination with the vegetation and soil-type map area method. The results indicated that there was no obvious change between the present distribution ranges of the wild Daphnes Cortex and its historical records, but the density of the population has undergone major changes. The wild reserves resources has declined seriously, even on the verge of exhaustion in some regions. According to the survey results, the current total reserve of the wild Daphnes Cortex in the four provinces was no more than 600 tons. Simultaneously, we only found the cultivated resource in a mountain at an altitude of about 2 800 m in Kang county of Gansu province, which cropping scope was about 33 000 m\u00b2. The cultivated resource can't provide medicinal products at present, because their growing period is too short to have curative effect. Destructive excavation and the longer growth cycle result in a sharp decline of the wild resources reserves, even to the point of extinction. Artificial cultivation of product will become the main source of medicinal resources in the future. Therefore, we must protect its suitable habitat, formulate rational harvesting policy, strengthen the supervision of government departments, collect and establish the germplasm nursery and seed bank. On the basis, we must carry out studies into seed-selecting and breeding as well as rapid propagation and growth technology at once."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Pharmacy, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100102, China."}], "LastName": "Geng", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Pharmacy, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100102, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Si-Tong", "Initials": "ST"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Pharmacy, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100102, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Han", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Pharmacy, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100102, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ming-Yang", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Pharmacy, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100102, China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Guang-Xi", "Initials": "GX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Pharmacy, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100102, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yan-Peng", "Initials": "YP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Qinhuangdao Shanhai Pass, Qinhuangdao 066200, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Qinhuangdao Shanhai Pass, Qinhuangdao 066200, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhong-Yi", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Pharmacy, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100102, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chun-Sheng", "Initials": "CS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Daphne"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endangered Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28925112", "10.4268/cjcmm20161803"]}}]}
