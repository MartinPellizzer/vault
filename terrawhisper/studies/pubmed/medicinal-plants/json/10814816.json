Murashige and Skoog's (MS) medium [T. Murashige, F. Skoog, A revised medium for rapid growth and bioassays with tobacco tissue cultures. Physiol. Plant. 15 (1962) 473-497] supplemented with 5.0 mg/l kinetin and 1.0 mg/l NAA was optimal for direct regeneration of plants from leaf explants while 8.0 mg/l kinetin and 1.0 mg/l NAA proved optimum for nodal explants for maximum number of shoots per explant. Callus induction was observed from nodal explants on MS medium supplemented with 10 mg/l kinetin and 1.0 mg/l NAA. Callus on further transfer to MS medium with 0.5 mg/l BAP and 0.1 mg/l NAA exhibited regeneration of maximum number of shoots. In vitro grown shoots of both direct and indirect origin rooted within 7-10 days following transfer to half strength MS medium with 1.0 mg/l IBA. Plantlets were acclimatized under glass house conditions with 90% survival. Randomly selected 85 individual Calliclones were subjected to field trial with 85-95% survival for two successive years along with control in randomized block design with three replicates. Screening of these calliclones revealed two distinct morphotypes, one with parental type highly dentated leaves (HDL) and the other with less dentated, round leaves (LDL). Only HDL calliclones flowered under field conditions. The LDL clones differed in several herb related agronomic characteristics such as plant height, herb yield, canopy size and number of branches per plant from the parental type as well as from the parent, which seems advantageous for commercial exploitation of such clones. The HDL clones closely resemble the parent in having higher content of citronellol than geraniol while the LDL clones contain almost equal contents of citronellol and geraniol in their essential oils as revealed by gas chromatography analysis. It is noticeable that the variability both in terms of agronomic characters and essential oil profiles among the clones were stable over 2 years of field trials."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Genetic Resources and Biotechnology Division, Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, P.O.
