Peptidehydrolase has an apparent molecular weight of 89,000 and an isoelectric point of 4.7. Peptidehydrolase activity was not affected by metal chelators but it was affected by N-bromosuccinimide, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and N-ethylmaleimide, suggesting the presence of tryptophan and serine residues together with free--SH groups in its active site. Peptidehydrolase activity was maximally active from pH 6.0 to 9.0 being practically zero below pH 5.0. It was stable at temperatures up to 40 degrees C, and complete inactivation was obtained at or over 70 degrees C. Aminopeptidase has an apparent molecular weight of 83,000 and an isoelectric point of 4.5. Its activity was affected by N-bromosuccinimide, suggesting the presence of tryptophan residues in its active site. The aminopeptidase presents its maximal activity at pH 5.5. It was stable at temperatures up to 40 degrees C, and complete inactivation was detected at over 70 degrees C."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guerra", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nicol\u00e1s", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Spain", "MedlineTA": "Rev Esp Fisiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0404475", "ISSNLinking": "0034-9402"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Hydrolases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.11.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Aminopeptidases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Aminopeptidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isoelectric Point"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6361931"]}}]}
