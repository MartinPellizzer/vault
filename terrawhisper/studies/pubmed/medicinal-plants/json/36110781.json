Various types of plant extracts with inherent synergistic properties are being used against oral diseases. Thus, in the present study, the anti-microbial activity of <i>Rumex nervosus</i> extracts was studied against six common oral pathogenic bacterial strains and a pathogenic fungus.", "Plants of <i>R. nervosus</i> were collected and air-dried, and extracts from various plant parts were obtained. Six clinical isolates of bacteria, namely <i>Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, E. faecalis</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i>), and one pathogenic Candida (<i>C. albicans</i>) were obtained. Antibacterial and antifungal activity of <i>R. nervosus</i> was determined using the Kirby-Bauer agar disc diffusion method. Zones of inhibition were recorded after 48 h of incubation. Data collected were analyzed. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied. <i>P</i> < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.", "Methanol extract from leaves were highly effective against <i>S. aureus</i>, with a mean inhibition zone of 33 mm, followed by a 28-mm zone of inhibition using an extract from roots and a minimum inhibition zone using an extract from stems. Zones of inhibition using methanol extract from roots were effective against <i>S. mutans</i>, <i>S. sanguinis</i>, <i>E. faecalis</i>, and <i>L. acidophilus</i>, with mean inhibition zones being 19, 17, 33, and 31 mm, respectively.", "The study has provided insight into a new potential herbal anti-microbial agent that may benefit dental care."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2022 Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Khalid University College of Dentistry, Abha, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Al-Farhan", "ForeName": "Ali Hussain", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Khalid University College of Dentistry, Abha, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Asiri", "ForeName": "Khalid Ahmed", "Initials": "KA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, King Khalid University College of Medicine, Abha, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Raju", "ForeName": "Martin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, King Khalid University, College of Science Abha, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Hichri", "ForeName": "Faycal", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dental Sciences, King Khalid University College of Dentistry, Abha, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Abu-Melha", "ForeName": "Abdulaziz Saad", "Initials": "AS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Bioallied Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101537209", "ISSNLinking": "0975-7406"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Al-Asmari AR, Siddiqui YM, Athar MT, Al-Buraidi A, Al-Eid AS, Horaib GB.
