Moreover, the growing demand of consumers for nutritious and healthy foods is greatly promoting the increased intake of FVs. <i>Allium</i> (Alliaceae) is a perennial bulb plant genus of the Liliaceae family. They are customarily utilized as vegetable, medicinal, and ornamental plants and have an important role in agriculture, aquaculture, and the pharmaceutical industry. <i>Allium</i> plants produce abundant secondary metabolites, such as organosulfur compounds, flavonoids, phenols, saponins, alkaloids, and polysaccharides. Accordingly, <i>Allium</i> plants possess a variety of nutritional, biological, and health-promoting properties, including antimicrobial, antioxidant, antitumor, immunoregulatory, antidiabetic, and anti-inflammatory effects. This review aims to highlight the advances in the research on the bioactive components, physiological activities and clinical trials, toxicological assessment for safety, and applications of different <i>Allium</i> plants. It also aims to cover the direction of future research on the <i>Allium</i> genus. This review is expected to provide theoretical reference for the comprehensive development and utilization of <i>Allium</i> plants in the fields of functional foods, medicine, and cosmetics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9547-3772"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Healthy Food Development and Nutrition Regulation of China National Light Industry, School of Chemical Engineering and Energy Technology, Dongguan University of Technology, Dongguan, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Jing-Kun", "Initials": "JK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Healthy Food Development and Nutrition Regulation of China National Light Industry, School of Chemical Engineering and Energy Technology, Dongguan University of Technology, Dongguan, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Healthy Food Development and Nutrition Regulation of China National Light Industry, School of Chemical Engineering and Energy Technology, Dongguan University of Technology, Dongguan, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yujia", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Healthy Food Development and Nutrition Regulation of China National Light Industry, School of Chemical Engineering and Energy Technology, Dongguan University of Technology, Dongguan, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Edible Fungi, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, National Engineering Research Center of Edible Fungi, Key Laboratory of Edible Fungi Resources and Utilization (South), Ministry of Agriculture, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wenhan", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Edible Fungi, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, National Engineering Research Center of Edible Fungi, Key Laboratory of Edible Fungi Resources and Utilization (South), Ministry of Agriculture, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Henan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Healthy Food Development and Nutrition Regulation of China National Light Industry, School of Chemical Engineering and Energy Technology, Dongguan University of Technology, Dongguan, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Allium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35343832", "10.1080/10408398.2022.2056132"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
