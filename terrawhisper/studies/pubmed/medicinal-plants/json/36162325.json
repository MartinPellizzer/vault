The pathogen delivers approximately 70 type III effectors (T3Es) into plant cells during infection. In this study, we confirmed that a T3E RipB is recognized in tobacco. We further demonstrated that RipB is conserved among R.\u00a0solanacearum isolates and five different ripB alleles are all recognized in tobacco. The ripB from GMI1000 was transformed into susceptible host Arabidopsis, and a defect in root development was observed in ripB-transgenic plants. Pathogen inoculation assays showed that ripB expression promoted plant susceptibility to R.\u00a0solanacearum infection, indicating that RipB contributes to pathogen virulence in Arabidopsis. Expression of ripB in roq1 mutant partially suppressed reactive oxygen species production, confirming that RipB interferes with plant basal defense. Interestingly, ripB expression promoted cytokinin-related gene expression in Arabidopsis, suggesting a role of cytokinin signaling pathway in plant-R.\u00a0solanacearum interactions. Finally, RipB harbors potential 14-3-3 binding motifs, but the associations between RipB and 14-3-3 proteins were undetectable in yeast two-hybrid assay. Together, our results demonstrate that multiple ripB alleles are recognized in Nicotiana, and RipB suppresses basal defense in susceptible host to promote R.\u00a0solanacearum infection."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
