Among them, rhodium complexes have a limited history and there are a few discussions about their biological activities documented in the literature. However, investigation of kinetically inert rhodium complexes has recently attracted lots of attention and especially there are various evidences on their anti-cancer activity. It seems that they can be investigated as a versatile surrogates or candidates for the existing drugs which do not affect selectively or suffer from various side effects. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the use of mononuclear rhodium (III) organometallo drugs due to its versatile structurally important aspects to inhibit various enzymes. It has been demonstrated that organometallic Rh complexes profiting from both organic and inorganic aspects have shown more potent biological activities than classical inorganic compartments. In this respect, smart design, use of the appropriate organic ligands, and efficient and user-friendly synthesis of organometallic Rh complexes have played crucial roles in the inducing desirable biological activities. In this review, we focused on the recent advances published on the bioactivity of Rh (III/II/I) complexes especially inhibitory activity, from 2013 till now. Accordingly, considering the structure-activity relationship (SAR), the effect of oxidation state (+1,\u00a0+2, and\u00a0+3) and geometry (dimer or monomer complexes with coordination number of 4 and 6) of Rh complexes as well as various ligands on in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo studies was comprehensively discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.
