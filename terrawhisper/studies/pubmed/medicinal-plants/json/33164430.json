Currently, the chemical profile of A. rupestris has not been disclosed, resulting in a great obstacle for the systematic clarification of the efficacy materials and the quality evaluations. In this paper, HPLC-IT-TOF-MS was deployed to characterize the chemical constituents in A. rupestris. As a result, a total of 124 compounds were detected in 75% ethanol extract of A. rupestris. By comparing with the reference compounds, seven chlorogenic acids, and four flavonoids as well as one sesquiterpenoid were definitely identified. Moreover, twenty sesquiterpenes, sixty-five flavonoids and twenty-three chlorogenic acids were preliminarily identified by matching MS/MS spectral information with literature data and applying those empirical mass spectrometric cracking rules. In current study, the chemical composition of A. rupestris was profiled in depth, and the findings are envisioned to provide a theoretical basis for the further studies of this well-known herbal medicine, such as efficacy material characterization and quality assessment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Ethnomedicine (Minzu University of China), Ministory of Education, School of Pharmacy, Minzu University of China Beijing 100081, China Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Materia Medica,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Pei-Jie", "ForeName": "Zhang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Materia Medica,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Cao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Materia Medica,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Ke", "ForeName": "Zhang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Materia Medica,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Yue-Lin", "ForeName": "Song", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Materia Medica,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Jun", "ForeName": "L I", "Initials": "LI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Ethnomedicine (Minzu University of China), Ministory of Education, School of Pharmacy, Minzu University of China Beijing 100081, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Tang", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "40"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33164430", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200416.202"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
