As AD is a multifactorial illness, various single-target directed drugs that have reached clinical trials have failed. Therefore, various factors associated with outset of AD have been considered in targeted drug discovery and development. In this work, a wide range of 1,2,3-triazole-chromenone carboxamides were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their cholinesterase inhibitory activity. Among them, N-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)-7-((1-(3,4-dimethylbenzyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy)-2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carboxamide (11b) showed the best acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub>\u202f=\u202f1.80\u202f\u00b5M), however, it was inactive toward butyrylcholinesterase. It should be noted that compound 11b was evaluated for its BACE1 inhibitory activity and calculated IC<sub>50</sub>\u202f=\u202f21.13\u202f\u00b5M confirmed desired inhibitory activity. Also, this compound revealed satisfactory neuroprotective effect against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cell death in PC12 neurons at 50\u202f\u00b5M as well as metal chelating ability toward Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
