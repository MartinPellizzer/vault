The compounds were elucidated as stelleraguaianone B (1) and C (2) by comprehensive spectroscopic analysis, including 1D and 2D NMR as well as HRESIMS, and by comparing their NMR data with known compounds. In addition, the structure of 1 was further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Both the compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity on common tumour cell lines in vitro, which revealed that compound 1 exhibits cytotoxic activity on A549 cells, while 2 has no activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
