The rats were randomly divided into sham-operation group, model group with kidney cut off largely, the group treated by aldehyde oxygen amylum, the group treated with Shenshuaining and groups treated by high, moderate and low doses of Qichou decoction. The animals in the sham-operation group and model group were given with equated physiological brine. The dosages of aldehyde oxygen amylum and Shenshuaining were 0.9 g x kg(-1) and 0.37 g x kg(-1) respectively. The high, moderate and low dosages of Qichou decoction were 53.1, 26.6 g x kg(-1) and 13.3 g x kg(-1) respectively. The contents of leucocyte adhesion molecules including CD11b and CD44 in microserum were labeled by fluorescein and measured by flow Cytometry. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha)was detected by Dot-ELISA assay.", "The expression of CD11b, CD44 and obviously in the model group as compared with sham-operation group. The weights of left kidney, the ratio of left kidney TNF-alpha was increased weight/body weight. BUN and Scr were also increased obviously. After the treatment with Qichou decoction, the contents of CD11b, CD44, TNF-a, BUN and Scr in the rats with kidney cut off largely were reduced significantly. Similarly, the weight of left kidney and the ratio of the left kidney weight/body weight were also decreased obviously.", "Leucocyte adhesion molecules including CD11b and CD44 in the rats with largely partial nephrectomy were significantly regulated by Qichou decoction. Qichou decoction can prevent immersion of the cells and inflammation, inhibit compensatory glomerular hypertrophy of the rest kidney, prevent the glomerular interstitial fibrosis, and protect the kidney in the rats with kidney cut off largely from further impairment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Harbin University of Commerce, College of Medicine, Harbin 150076, China. zhangcuiliulu@sohu.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Cui", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CD11b Antigen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hyaluronan Receptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AYI8EX34EU", "NameOfSubstance": "Creatinine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Urea Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "CD11b Antigen"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Creatinine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Hyaluronan Receptors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Nephrectomy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16494034"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
