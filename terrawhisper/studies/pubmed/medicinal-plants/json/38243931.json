Recently, a diverse variety of animal models have been established to better understand the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus, and new medications to treat the condition have been introduced in the market. Flavonoids are naturally occurring substances that can be found in plants and various foods and may have health benefits in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Flavonoids have also been shown to have an anti-inflammatory impact that is significant to neuropathic pain, as indicated by a decrease in several pro-inflammatory mediators such TNF-, NF-B IL-6, and IL-1. Flavonoids appear to be a viable novel therapy option for macrovasular complications in preclinical models; however, human clinical data is still inadequate. Recently, several in silico, in-vitro and in-vivo aproaches were made to evaluate mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of diabetes in a better way. Screening of natural antidiabetic agents from plant sources can be analysed by utilizing advanced in-vitro techniques and animal models. Natural compounds, mostly derived from plants, have been studied in diabetes models generated by chemical agents in the majority of research. The aim of this work was to review the available in silico, in-vitro and animal models of diabetes for screening of natural antidiabetic agents. This review contributes to the scientist's design of new methodologies for the development of novel therapeutic agents having potential antihyperglycemic activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6082-9900"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centurion University of Technology and Management, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, 751003, India."}], "LastName": "Dash", "ForeName": "Jyoshna Rani", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4530-1005"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, SOA University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, 751003, India."}], "LastName": "Kar", "ForeName": "Biswakanth", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3532-721X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centurion University of Technology and Management, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, 751003, India."}], "LastName": "Pattnaik", "ForeName": "Gurudutta", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Discov Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "101157212", "ISSNLinking": "1570-1638"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38243931", "10.2174/0115701638290819231228081120", "CDDT-EPUB-137280"]}}]}
