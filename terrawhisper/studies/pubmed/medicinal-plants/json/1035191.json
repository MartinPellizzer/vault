Such being the case, the central depressant actions of methanol extract of coptis root, its active ingredients such as non-alkaloids fraction, tertiary base fraction, quarternary base fraction, magnoflorine fraction, berberine hydrochloride, coptisine hydrochloride and the extract from SAN O SHA SHIN TO being one of the preparations which contain coptis root were investigated in mice. The antigastric ulcer action of these substances was also examined in rats. All substances were given orally. Sontaneous movement and coordinative motor activity were not depressed by methanol extract, non-alkaloid fraction quarternary base fraction, magnoflorine fraction, berberine hydrochloride, coptisine hhdrochloride and the extract from SAN O SHA SHIN TO. There was no inhibition of chemical- and electro-shock-induced convulsion, morphine induced Straub's tail reaction, apomorphine-induced masticating motion and aggressive behavior induced by electrical stimulation. A loss of righting reflex due to hypnotics was not potentiated by the substances. The quarternary base fraction did not elicit central depression, while the tertiary base fraction slightly depressed the function of the central nervous system. Quarternary base alkaloids such as berberine exerted a slight antiulcer effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamahara", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0420550", "ISSNLinking": "0015-5691"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Convulsants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tranquilizing Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0I8Y3P32UF", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Agonistic Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Convulsants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cooperative Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Locomotion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mastication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tranquilizing Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1976", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1035191", "10.1254/fpj.72.899"]}}]}
