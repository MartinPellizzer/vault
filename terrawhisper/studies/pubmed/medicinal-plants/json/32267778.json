Metal nanoparticles with potential antimicrobial properties are an area that can be explored to discover novel antimicrobial agents. The traditional synthesis methods of metal nanoparticles involve the use of toxic chemicals and the generation of harmful byproducts. In this study, a greener method to synthesize silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with potential antimicrobial properties was investigated. The aqueous extract of the medicinal plant <i>Phyla dulcis</i> Trev. (verbenaceae) was used as the reducing and stabilizing agent to synthesize AgNPs using microwave irradiation. The formation of AgNPs was confirmed using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy by the appearance of characteristic surface plasmon resonance peaks in the 430-440\u2009nm wavelength range. The size and stability of the AgNPs were studied using Zetasizer nano-series for 5 weeks after synthesis. The average particle size remained between 63 and 76\u2009nm during the first 4 weeks and increased to 114\u2009nm in the fifth week showing possible aggregation after the fourth week. The zeta potential remained between -20 and -24\u2009mV throughout the 5 weeks showing relatively good stability. Scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed the association of phytoconstituents with the AgNPs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirmed the formation of metallic nanoparticles starting from silver nitrate. Finally, the AgNPs were tested to be effective against <i>Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7 (ATCC 43888), <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium (novobiocin and nalidixic acid resistant strain), <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> (4b; ATCC 19115), <i>and Staphylococcus aureus</i> (ATCC 6538) strains, which are known to be common foodborne pathogens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Agricultural Research Center, Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas."}], "LastName": "Carson", "ForeName": "Laura", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Agricultural Research Center, Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas."}], "LastName": "Bandara", "ForeName": "Subhani", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Agricultural Research Center, Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas."}], "LastName": "Joseph", "ForeName": "Marshall", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Agricultural Research Center, Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas."}], "LastName": "Green", "ForeName": "Tony", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas."}], "LastName": "Grady", "ForeName": "Tony", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Agricultural Research Center, Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas."}], "LastName": "Osuji", "ForeName": "Godson", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Agricultural Research Center, Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas."}], "LastName": "Weerasooriya", "ForeName": "Aruna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Agricultural Research Center, Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas."}], "LastName": "Ampim", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Agricultural Research Center, Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas."}], "LastName": "Woldesenbet", "ForeName": "Selamawit", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Foodborne Pathog Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "101120121", "ISSNLinking": "1535-3141"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Green Chemistry Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Verbenaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32267778", "10.1089/fpd.2019.2714"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
