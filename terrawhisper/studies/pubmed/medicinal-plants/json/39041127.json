The fingerprint of 17 batches of Bletillae Rhizoma from different areas was established using HPLC, and the similarity analysis was carried out. The common chemical components of the 17 batches of Bletillae Rhizoma were identified using UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap HRMS. Depending on the bioavailability and drug-like properties of the common components, the active chemical components were screened, and then their protein targets were collected using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Database and Analysis Platform(TCMSP) and SwissTargetPrediction database. The protein targets related to diseases were retrieved from the databases DrugBank, TTD and GeneCards to produce a Venn diagram. The shared targets were obtained between drugs and diseases as &quot;homotherapy for heteropathy&quot; targets. The protein-protein interaction(PPI) was analyzed with the STRING database, and KEGG and GO analyses of the &quot;homotherapy for heteropathy&quot; targets were performed using the Bioconductor database. Cytoscape 3.7.2 software was employed to construct the &quot;chemical components of Bletillae Rhizoma-homotherapy for heteropathy targets&quot; network and PPI network, and topological analysis was conducted to screen out the key active chemical components and core targets. Finally, the affinity between the active components and core targets was evaluated using the molecular docking by AutoDock Vina 4.2.6, which verified the interaction between them. Thirteen common peaks were identified by fingerprint chromatography, and the similarity between different batches was 0.941-0.998. Fifty-three chemical components were identified by mass spectrometry in Bletillae Rhizoma, and 18 common chemical constituents were obtained in the 17 batches of Bletillae Rhizoma. Network pharmacologic screening showed that the pharmacodynamic substances of Bletillae Rhizoma for melasma, gastrointestinal hemo-rrhage, lung cancer and bronchoplumonary inflammation with &quot;homotherapy for heteropathy&quot; were 11 compounds, such as polysaccharides, biphenanthrenes, dihydrophenanthrenes and bibenzyls. There were 42 common targets identified for the treatment of different diseases. These targets were involved in biological processes such as cell response to chemical stress, reactive oxygen species and positive regulation of protein kinase B signal transduction. They were also involved in 121 signaling pathways, encompassing vital pathways such as PI3K-Akt, ErbB, Rap1, FoxO, MAPK and estrogen. Molecular docking results showed a strong affinity between the key active components and the core targets. This study provides a preliminary explanation of how Bletillae Rhizoma exerts its therapeutic effect on chloasma, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, lung cancer, and bronchopneumonic lesions as &quot;homotherapy for heteropathy&quot; through a combined action involving multiple components, targets, and pathways. These findings offer a certain theoretical basis for the further deve-lopment and application of Bletillae Rhizoma."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine(Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chun-Hua", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine(Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Chang-Li", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine(Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine(Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yong-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Wei-Dong", "Initials": "WD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Network Pharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Melanosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Orchidaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39041127", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20240311.202"]}}]}
