El Escorial was originally conceived by the Spanish Habsburg monarch, Philip II (1527-1598), as an elaborate burial place for his parents, Emperor Charles V and Isabella. It soon became a symbol of the Spanish empire and Philip's Catholic leadership of the Counter-Reformation. El Escorial included a monastery, palace, basilica, mausoleum, seminary, library, and hospital. Nothing was spared by Philip in obtaining the finest examples of religious art, architecture, music, and books. Philip, as absolute monarch, inherited a vast empire which stretched over Europe, Asia, North Africa, and the New World. His style of personal micro-management and poor economic planning hampered his ability to manage both national and foreign affairs. Philip had a special interest in medicine, including royal hospitals, improved government standards for physicians, medicinal plants, and the health benefits of alchemy and sacred relics. El Escorial's grand scale has generated both illustrious praise and critical condemnation over the last four centuries. Its place in Spanish and world history is assured."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, 97 Paterson Street, New Brunswick, NJ 08901-0019, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Belsh", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Biography", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord", "NlmUniqueID": "100964775", "ISSNLinking": "1466-0822"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Architecture"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Catholicism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Famous Persons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 16th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 17th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 18th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}], "PersonalNameSubjectList": [{"LastName": "Philip II"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12365069", "10.1080/146608299300079510"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
