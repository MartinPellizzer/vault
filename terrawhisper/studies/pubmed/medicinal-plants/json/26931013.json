The study was carried out on 6 outbred dogs-males, by mass 14-17 kg, with the fistula of stomach by Basov. A leu-enkephalin (\"Vector\", Russia) was entered intravenously in a dose 7 mcg/kg. The corresponding plant-based preparations entered perorally during 10-14 days to beginning of experiments, on an empty stomach, in a volume a no more than 20 ml. Experiments put in a morning clock, in 16-18 hours after eating, after the careful washing of stomach. For 30 mines to the record of motive activity of stomach an animal was enter a peptide or gave a corresponding extract as water or spirit infusion. At the choice of doses of vegetable preparations came from the before obtained data about the antiulcerous action of the used plants. The conduct of peptide rendered considerable stimulant influence on motor activity of stomach, that was expressed in the increase of period of work and increase of force of reductions especially tonic. All used plants preparations rendered modulating influence on motive activity of stomach. Changes consisted in strengthening of tonic and oppressing of phase component. The most considerable decline of amount of phase reductions caused application of extract of goose-grass. Not only an amount but also force of phase reductions diminished thus. An extract from the root of chicory less considerably reduced the arnount of Phase reJuctions, but here substantially increased their force. All used herbal medicines stimulated tonic activity. Thus, peptide and all studied herbal medicines stimulated motion activity of the stomach that could cause acceleration of evacuation of food to duodenum. Such effect should be considered while choosing the medicine for correction of stomach functional activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vymjatnina", "ForeName": "Z K", "Initials": "ZK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Prosekina", "ForeName": "E Y", "Initials": "EY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tomova", "ForeName": "T A", "Initials": "TA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Eksp Klin Gastroenterol", "NlmUniqueID": "101144944", "ISSNLinking": "1682-8658"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "58822-25-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Enkephalin, Leucine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enkephalin, Leucine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Motility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26931013"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
