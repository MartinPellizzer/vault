Therefore, this study aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of anemia and PPD.", "This review study was conducted according to the MOOSE protocol and results have been reported according to the PRISMA guideline. We searched epidemiologic studies published until January 2018 in nine English databases including Scopus, PubMed/Medline, Science Direct, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EBSCO and Google Scholar using English MeSH keywords. The heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using the Cochran's Q test and I<sup>2</sup> index.

In 8 studies, anemia during pregnancy significantly increased the risk of postpartum depression (heterogeneity test: P=0.116, I<sup>2</sup>=36.422%), RR=1.240 (1.001-1.536, P=0.048). The subgroup analysis of postpartum anemia and PPD was not significant for the variables of quality of studies, study design, and the period of evaluating depression and anemia. The subgroup analysis of anemia during pregnancy and PPD was not significant for the period of evaluating depression.
