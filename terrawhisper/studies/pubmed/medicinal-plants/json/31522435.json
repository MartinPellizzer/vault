Development of therapies aimed to suppress angiogenesis using medicinal plants is one of the effective approaches for prevention/treatment of cancer. The current study was performed to investigate in vitro anti-angiogenic effect of Teucrium Polium (TP) extract and its fractions.\u00a0The aerial part of Teucrium Polium was powdered and extracted with 50% ethanol. The extract was fractionated in to aqueous (AQ), n-butanol (BU), ethyl acetate (EA) and n-hexane (HE) fractions. Anti-angiogenic effect of TP was examined on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in three-dimensional collagen matrix. The endothelial cells form capillary-like branches that can be visualized using phase contrast microscope and the number of tube-like structures can be quantified as a measure of in vitro angiogenesis. Furthermore, anti-proliferative and vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF )suppressive effect of TP as important factors in the process of angiogenesis were assessed using3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT)and quantitative ELISA, respectively.\u00a0Based on our findings, among the TP fractions, EA fraction showed the highest inhibitory activity on angiogenesis. This fraction with IC50: 68 \u00b5g/mL, inhibited angiogenesis at 60 \u00b5g/mL. The crude extract and other fractions of TP inhibited angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner at doses higher concentrations than EA fraction, significantly.TP extract and EA fraction were able to inhibit proliferation of HUVEC and inhibited VEGF secretion in a dose dependent manner. The ethyl acetate fraction at 60 \u00b5g/ml inhibited VEGF secretion perfectly. Our data indicated that ethyl acetate fraction of Teucrium Polium could be a potential candidate for the prevention of angiogenesis in cancer and other related disorders. However, this suggestion needs more quantitative and in vivo investigations for confirmation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran. va_fzh@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Askari", "ForeName": "Vahide", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran. somayeh.shamlou@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Shamlou", "ForeName": "Somayeh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran AND Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran. amostafaie@kums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Mostafaie", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran. sarakhaleqi2014@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Khaleqi", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "101146178", "ISSNLinking": "1735-1502"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Angiogenesis Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Angiogenesis Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Movement"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Neovascularization, Physiologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Teucrium"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31522435", "10.18502/ijaai.v18i3.1121"]}}]}
