However, studies about the potential mechanisms of plant extracts on the humoral and tissular immunities in fish have received less attention. This study aimed to screen the immunestimulating properties of 20 ethanol plant extracts on striped catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus leukocytes. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and head kidney leukocytes (HKLs) of striped catfish (50\u202f\u00b1\u202f5\u202fg per fish) were stimulated at 10 and 100\u202f\u03bcg of each plant extract per mL of cell culture medium. Several humoral immune parameters (lysozyme, complement and total immunoglobulin) were examined at 24-h post stimulation (hps). Furthermore, the responses of four cytokine genes, namely il1\u03b2, ifr\u03b3 2a and b, and mhc class II were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hps. The results showed that lysozyme, complement as well as total immunoglobulin levels in both PBMCs and HKLs were regulated by some of the plant extracts tested in a concentration-dependent manner; some plant extracts induced the highest immune responses at the low dose (10\u202f\u03bcg\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup>) while others were more efficient at high dose (100\u202f\u03bcg\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup>). Among the extracts, five extracts including garlic Allium sativum L. (As), neem Azadirachta indica A. Juss (Ai), asthma-plant Euphorbia hirta L. (Eh), bhumi amla Phyllanthus amarus Schum. et Thonn (Pa), and ginger Zingiber officinale Rosc (Zo) induced significant changes in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine (il1\u03b2), antiviral cytokines (ifr\u03b3 2a and b) and adaptive immune cytokine (mhc class II) in striped catfish cells. Pa always modulated the strongest expression of the four cytokines in PBMCs and HKLs over the whole experimental period (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), whereas Zo did not stimulate the mhc class II expression in striped catfish leukocytes throughout experimental periods. These in vitro results demonstrated that some plant extracts could differently modulate great potential immune response in fish, supporting their applications in further in vivo experiments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
