We investigate the hepatoprotective effects of aqueous-ethanolic extract of Capparis decidua (Stems) against paracetamol induced liver injury in experimental animals. To observe the level of improvement, biochemical parameters such as SGPT, SGOT, ALP and Total bilirubin levels as well as histopathological changes in liver tissues were studied. Silymarin (50mg/kg, p.o.) was used as reference drug. The levels of the biochemical parameters were increased in rabbits which were intoxicate by paracetamol. Capparis decidua extract (750mg/kg, b.w.) treated rabbits showed maximum reduction of biochemical parameters in a significant (p<0.001) manner. Histopathological examination of the liver tissues of control and treated groups also confirmed the hepatoprotective activity. The phytochemical screening of the extracts revealed the presence of tannins, alkaloids, saponins and flavonoids. The results of the present study therefore suggest that the different doses of Capparis decidua possess significant hepatoprotective effect and this effect might be due to the presence of flavonoids and tannins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University College of Conventional Medicine, Faculty of Pharmacy & Alternative Medicine, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Pakistan / Department of Eastern Medicine, Qarshi University, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rehman", "ForeName": "Jalilur", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University College of Conventional Medicine, Faculty of Pharmacy & Alternative Medicine, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akhtar", "ForeName": "Naveed", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University College of Conventional Medicine, Faculty of Pharmacy & Alternative Medicine, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Asif", "ForeName": "Hafiz Muhammad", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University College of Conventional Medicine, Faculty of Pharmacy & Alternative Medicine, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sultana", "ForeName": "Sabira", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University College of Conventional Medicine, Faculty of Pharmacy & Alternative Medicine, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Mukhtiar", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "362O9ITL9D", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetaminophen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaline Phosphatase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RFM9X3LJ49", "NameOfSubstance": "Bilirubin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetaminophen"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaline Phosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Bilirubin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Capparis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28649077"]}}]}
