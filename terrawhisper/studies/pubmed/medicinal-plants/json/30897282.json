Clarke is one of the potential medicinal plants extensively used in eastern traditional medicine such as Unani, Ayurveda, Siddha, and in traditional Tibetan and Chinese medicine. S. paniculata is the common adulterant of S. cordata at herbal shops and markets but S. paniculata is also used in number of herbal formulations. The present study was conducted to use microscopic, pharmacognostic, and phytochemical techniques as a tool for the authentication of herbal drug chiraita (S. cordata). In herbal markets, mixing, adulteration, and use of spurious materials as substitute have become a major concern for herbal practitioners, local user, and industry for reasons of safety and efficacy. Therefore, authentication of medicinal plants is of utmost importance at each level of drug research. In the present study, anatomical features of two species showed a great diversity, as irregular epidermal cells and nonglandular, unicellular trichomes were found in S. cordata while in S. paniculata epidermal cells were hexagonal in shape and trichomes were A-shaped. Antioxidant activity of two species showed a great variation where IC<sub>50</sub> value recorded for S. cordata was 208\u2009\u03bcg/mL, while for S. paniculata IC<sub>50</sub> was 624\u2009\u03bcg/mL. The study can serve as an important source of information to achieve the authenticity and to evaluate the quality and purity of the plant material in accordance to WHO guidelines. As this species is greatly exploited, so conservation is highly recommended."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, Comsats University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rashid", "ForeName": "Sofia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2971-2848"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Mushtaq", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2002-3907"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Zafar", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sultana", "ForeName": "Shazia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, The Women University, Multan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Sidra Nisar", "Initials": "SN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Yaseen", "ForeName": "Ghulam", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Science and Art, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Bingol University, Bingol, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ozdemir", "ForeName": "Fethi Ahmet", "Initials": "FA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Hazara University, Mansehra, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Afza", "ForeName": "Rabia", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Microsc Res Tech", "NlmUniqueID": "9203012", "ISSNLinking": "1059-910X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Swertia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30897282", "10.1002/jemt.23257"]}}]}
