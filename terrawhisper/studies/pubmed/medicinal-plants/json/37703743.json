All tested compounds (5a-5p) displayed a strong \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a06.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18-113.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.94\u00a0\u03bcM) in comparison with the positive control acarbose (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0723.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.26\u00a0\u03bcM). Thereinto, 5g (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a06.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18\u00a0\u03bcM) showed the best anti-\u03b1-glucosidase activity and behaved as a mixed-type inhibitor with the value of K<sub>i</sub> and K<sub>is</sub> to be 1.65\u00a0\u03bcM and 4.54\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. Besides, fluorescence quenching experiment, three-dimensional fluorescence spectra assay, circular dichroism analysis, and molecular docking studies indicated that 5g may inhibit \u03b1-glucosidase activity by binding with its active site as well as changing the secondary structure of \u03b1-glucosidase. Combined with the inhibition effect on the rise of postprandial blood glucose level and low cytotoxicity of 5g, it could be concluded that these title compounds may play a role as lead compounds to develop novel \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
