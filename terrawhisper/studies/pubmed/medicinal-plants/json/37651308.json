However, the lack of an in-depth understanding of the intrinsic working mechanism for orphan receptors severely limits the related rational drug design. The G-protein-coupled receptor 52 (GPR52) is a unique orphan receptor that constitutively increases cellular 5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels without binding any exogenous agonists and has been identified as a promising therapeutic target for central nervous system disorders. Although recent structural biology studies have provided snapshots of both active and inactive states of GPR52, the mechanism of the conformational transition between these states remains unclear. Here, an acceptable self-activation pathway for GPR52 was proposed through 6 \u03bcs Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) simulations, in which the receptor spontaneously transitions from the active state to that matching the inactive crystal structure. According to the three intermediate states of the receptor obtained by constructing a reweighted potential of mean force, how the allosteric regulation occurs between the extracellular orthosteric binding pocket and the intracellular G-protein-binding site is revealed. Combined with the independent gradient model, several important microswitch residues and the allosteric communication pathway that directly links the two regions are both identified. Transfer entropy calculations not only reveal the complex allosteric signaling within GPR52 but also confirm the unique role of ECL2 in allosteric regulation, which is mutually validated with the results of GaMD simulations. Overall, this work elucidates the allosteric mechanism of GPR52 at the atomic level, providing the most detailed information to date on the self-activation of the orphan receptor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1166-8914"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental and Life Sciences, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Zhixiang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6088-2469"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental and Life Sciences, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Zhongjie", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental and Life Sciences, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Lianci", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental and Life Sciences, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xiaohan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental and Life Sciences, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Jingjie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7367-3968"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu 610106, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jianping", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0895-3506"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental and Life Sciences, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chunhua", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Inf Model", "NlmUniqueID": "101230060", "ISSNLinking": "1549-9596"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allosteric Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Communication"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37651308", "10.1021/acs.jcim.3c00672"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
