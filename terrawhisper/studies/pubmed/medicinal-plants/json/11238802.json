More recently, oxidation of LDL has been recognized as playing an important role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Oxidized LDL, but not native LDL, promotes vascular dysfunction by exerting direct cytotoxicity toward endothelial cells, by increasing chemotactic properties for monocytes, by transforming macrophages to foam cells via scavenger-receptors and by enhancing the proliferation of various cell types, e.g., endothelial cells, monocytes and smooth muscle cells; all of these events are recognized as contributing to atherogenesis. In this paper, experimental evidence is presented that shows that several garlic compounds can effectively suppress LDL oxidation in vitro. Short-term supplementation of garlic in human subjects has demonstrated an increased resistance of LDL to oxidation. These data suggest that suppressed LDL oxidation may be one of the powerful mechanisms accounting for the antiatherosclerotic properties of garlic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA 92350, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lau", "ForeName": "B H", "Initials": "BH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "81R3X99M15", "NameOfSubstance": "S-allylcysteine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K848JZ4886", "NameOfSubstance": "Cysteine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Arteriosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cysteine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Foam Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypercholesterolemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}], "NumberOfReferences": "23"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11238802", "10.1093/jn/131.3.985S"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
