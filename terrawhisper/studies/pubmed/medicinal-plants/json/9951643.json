Vitreoretinopathy was induced by intravitreal injection of 50 microliters of a mixture composed of 40 nmol of xanthine and 0.001 IU of xanthine oxidase. Rabbits were randomly distributed into four groups: Group 1 (n = 8) did not receive any treatment and served as a positive control. Groups 2 (n = 8) and 3 (n = 8) received for 1 month EGb761 given orally at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day, respectively 1 day after and 1 week before induction of retinopathy. Group 4 (n = 4) was treated by three intramuscular injections of 15,000 IU/kg of SOD, 24 h before induction and 24 and 48 h thereafter. Clinical evaluations and electroretinograms (ERG) were repeatedly performed until the animals were killed at day 28. Histological examinations and immunohistological procedures were performed to ascertain the origin and characteristics of the cellular proliferation and to compare vitreoretinal structures in the four groups.", "Intravitreal injection of xanthine-xanthine oxidase produced a strong inflammatory response with vitreous infiltrates and epiretinal membrane formation, inconstantly associated with retinal detachment. ERG showed a decrease of the a-, b- and c-waves beginning within a few hours after injection. Histologic evaluation found an intravitreal and epiretinal infiltration by leukocytes and epithelial-derived cells, dense vitreoretinal membranes and retinal detachments with occasional neovascularization. In the treated groups (groups 2-4), all clinical, electric and histologic data were significantly improved compared to the control group. However, no difference could be found among the three treated groups.", "This study demonstrates the strong pathologic effects of free radical production on the retina and the close relationships between free radicals, inflammatory pathways and vitreoretinal proliferative disorders. It also confirms the pharmacological interest of prevention by antioxidants and free radical scavengers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, ERCA-INSERM, Ambroise Par\u00e9 Hospital, University of Paris V, Boulogne/Seine, France."}], "LastName": "Baudouin", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pisella", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ettaiche", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Goldschild", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Becquet", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gastaud", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Droy-Lefaix", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol", "NlmUniqueID": "8205248", "ISSNLinking": "0721-832X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19FUJ2C58T", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginkgo biloba extract"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1AVZ07U9S7", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.17.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthine Oxidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electroretinography"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intramuscular"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Retina"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Vitreoretinopathy, Proliferative"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Vitreous Body"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthine"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthine Oxidase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9951643", "10.1007/s004170050195"]}}]}
