All the indices mentioned above were repeated and each patient served as his own control. The results indicate that AMR can improve hemodynamic parameters as well as exercise tolerance. Holter monitoring revealed no significant increase in arrythmogenic potentiality. The total clinical effective rate was 95%. No severe side effects were found except thrombocytopenia observed in 20% of the patients. It is suggested that China-made AMR is effective in treating refractory congestive heart failure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Second Affiliated Hospital, Third Military Medical College, Chongqing."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Y L", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Y M", "Initials": "YM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "16210490R", "ISSNLinking": "0578-1426"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "JUT23379TN", "NameOfSubstance": "Amrinone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Amrinone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrocardiography, Ambulatory"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Failure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemodynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2269028"]}}]}
