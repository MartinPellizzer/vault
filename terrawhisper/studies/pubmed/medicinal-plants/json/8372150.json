The oral administration of the pectin isolated from the fruit of the above plant at a dose of 200 mg/100 g BW/day showed a significant hypoglycaemic action in normal rats. Pectins isolated from many other plants have also been reported to have hypoglycaemic actions. The pectin administration resulted in a significant reduction in blood glucose and an increase in the liver glycogen. Glycogen synthetase activity was highly significant. Incorporation of labelled glucose into hepatic glycogen was also found to be higher. A significant reduction in phosphorylase activity was noted in the pectin-administered groups."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Kerala, Kariavattom, Thiruvananthapuram, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "G P", "Initials": "GP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sudheesh", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vijayalakshmi", "ForeName": "N R", "Initials": "NR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "89NA02M4RX", "NameOfSubstance": "Pectins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8372150", "10.1055/s-2006-959693"]}}]}
