As an environmentally safe method for disposal of invasive plants, we tested the effect of biochar produced from these plants in altering soil deterioration under acid rain as compared with lime. Given the impacts of the feedstock type and soil properties on the response of soil to the added biochar, we hypothesized that the microbial community and functions would respond differently to the charred invasive plants under acid rain. A pot experiment was conducted to examine the response of soil microbiomes and functions to the biochar produced from Blackjack (Biden Pilosa), Wedelia (Wedelia trilobata), and Bitter vine (Mikania micrantha Kunth), or quicklime (CaO) at a rate of 1\u202f% (w/w) under acid rain. Like soil pH, the nutrient contents (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), calcium, and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were important as dominant edaphic factors affecting soil microbial community and functionality. In this respect, lime decreased nutrients availability, driven by 11-fold, 44\u202f%, and 2-fold increments in calcium content, pH, and C/N ratio. Meanwhile, biochar improved nutrients availability under acid rain owing to maintaining a neutral pH (\u223c6.5), increasing calcium (by only 2-fold), and improving CEC, water repellency, and aggregation while decreasing the C/N ratio and aluminum content. Unlike biochar, lime decreased the relative abundance of Nitrosomonadaceae (the dominant ammonia-oxidizing bacteria) while augmenting the relative abundance of some fungal pathogens such as Spizellomycetaceae and Sporormiaceae. Given the highest nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon content than other biochar types, Wedelia-biochar resulted in the greatest relative abundance of Nitrosomonadaceae; thus, the microbial carbon and nitrogen biomasses were maximized. This study outlined the responses of the soil biogeochemical properties and the related microbial community structure and functionality to the biochar produced from invasive plants under acid rain. This study suggests that biochar can replace lime to ameliorate the effects of acid rain on soil physical, chemical and biological properties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
