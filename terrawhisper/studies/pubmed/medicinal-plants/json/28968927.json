The normal group consisted of 20 rats, while the remaining 80 rats were utilized for OC model establishment purposes, and further assigned into the model, 0.2 DEX, 1 DEX and 5 DEX groups (based on respective dosages of DEX, n=20 per group). The tumor inhibition rate was calculated. Positive expressions of p38 and NF-\u03baB in ovarian tissues were examined by means of immunohistochemical staining. Cell transformation as well as lymphocyte proliferation rates were measured using MTT. Cell cycle and apoptosis of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells were determined by flow cytometry. Serum levels of IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 were detected using ELISA, while qRT-PCR and western blotting methods were used to analyze mRNA and protein expressions of p38 and NF-\u03baB.", "Compared with the normal group, the other four groups exhibited up-regulated IL-2, TNF-\u03b1 serum levels as well as up regulated expressions of p38, NF-\u03baB65 mRNA and protein; while the respective percentages of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibited down-regulated rates. The other four groups displayed increases in tumor weight and cell apoptosis, as well as decreased levels of cell proliferation and transformation rates. The aforementioned findings of the study ultimately highlighted a greater tendency among the three DEX groups in comparison to the model group.", "The findings of the study suggest that a particular dosage of DEX may act to enhance the immune function of rats with OC by inhibiting the p38MAPK/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.
