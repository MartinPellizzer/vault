First time the reaction of the corresponding synthesized pyrimidinethione with 1,2-epoxy-3-chlorpropane at the presence of AlCl<sub>3</sub> catalyst in 75-80% yield alkyl-1-(3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl)-4-alkyl-6-phenyl-2-thioxo-1,2,5,6- tetrahydropyrimidine-5-carboxylates. In the next stage, new cyclic thiourea derivatives of aminoalcohols were synthesised from the reaction of chlorinated derivatives of pyrimidinethiones with single amines and their structures were investigated by spectroscopic methods. In this study, a series of novel compounds were tested towards some metabolic enzymes including \u03b1-glycosidase (\u03b1-Gly) and \u03b1-amylase (\u03b1-Amy) enzymes. Novel compounds showed K<sub>i</sub>s in ranging of 10.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.94-111.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.25\u00a0\u00b5M on \u03b1-glycosidase and IC<sub>50</sub> values in ranging of 14.38-106.51\u00a0\u00b5M on \u03b1-amylase. The novel cyclic thiourea derivatives of aminoalcohols had effective inhibition profiles against all tested metabolic enzymes. Binding affinity and inhibition mechanism of the most active compounds were detected with in silico studies and have shown that 2-Hydroxypropyl and butan-1-aminium moieties play a key role for inhibition of the enzymes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
