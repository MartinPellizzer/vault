In this study compound 5 is shown to be a more general mannosidase inhibitor than other currently known compounds and exhibits properties not previously observed with any other mannosidase inhibitors. Thus D-mannonolactam amidrazone not only inhibits the Golgi mannosidase I (IC50 = 4 microM) and mannosidase II (IC50 = 90-100 nM), but it is the first inhibitor that has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the soluble or endoplasmic reticulum alpha-mannosidase (IC50 = 1 microM). This compound also inhibited the aryl-mannosidases regardless of anomeric configuration although it was much more effective on enzymes recognizing alpha-linked mannose, i.e. jack bean and mung bean alpha-mannosidases (IC50 = 400 nM) as compared with fungal beta-mannosidase (IC50 = 150 microM). Mannonoamidrazone was tested in animal cell cultures using influenza virus-infected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells as a model system, and was found to prevent almost completely the formation of complex types of N-linked oligosaccharides with the formation of about equal amounts of Man9(GlcNAc)2 and Man8(GlcNAc)2 structures. Thus D-mannonolactam amidrazone is a potent but broad spectrum mannosidase inhibitor whose structure and properties should provide valuable insight into the design of other useful glycosidase inhibitors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock 72205."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Y T", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kaushal", "ForeName": "G P", "Initials": "GP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Papandreou", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ganem", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Elbein", "ForeName": "A D", "Initials": "AD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-17783", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "145196-57-2", "NameOfSubstance": "mannonolactam amidrazone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Mannosidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.24", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Mannosidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Endoplasmic Reticulum"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Mannosidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pyridines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Mannosidase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1569086", "S0021-9258(18)42444-1"]}}]}
