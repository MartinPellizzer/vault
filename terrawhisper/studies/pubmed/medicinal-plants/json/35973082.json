DC. is a well-known medicinal plant with high medicinal and economic value, and currently more than 6000 hectares are planted in China. Root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne hapla has been one of the most important pathogens on A. lancea. In September 2019, A. lancea plants exhibiting symptoms of severely stunting and gall formation in the roots associated with root-knot nematode (RKN; Meloidogyne spp.) were detected in a commercial production field in Yingshan, Hubei Province, China (30.96\u00b0N; 115.94\u00b0 E). Females and second-stage juveniles (J2s) collected from roots had the following morphometric characteristics: females (n=20) were pear-shaped, the front part of the worm had a prominent neck, and the stylet was short and obvious. The perineal pattern of females were generally round hexagonal or round-shaped, with a squared-off dorsal arch or a rounded-off arch, some had lateral lines marked (Eisenback et al. 1980). Body length (L) = 750.49 \u00b1 87.02 \u03bcm (578.75 - 902.65 \u03bcm), maximum body width (W) = 471.97 \u00b1 70.95 \u03bcm (318.7 - 586.3 \u03bcm), stylet length = 15.18 \u00b1 0.96 \u03bcm (13.52 - 17.04 \u03bcm), dorsal pharyngeal gland orifice to stylet base (DGO) = 3.07 \u00b1 0.37 \u03bcm (2.60 - 3.80\u03bcm). The second-stage juveniles (n=20): L = 480.05 \u00b1 42.73 \u03bcm (375.3 - 552.5 \u03bcm), stylet length =12.59 \u00b1 1.39 \u03bcm (10.5 - 16.8 \u03bcm), tail length= 53.35 \u00b1 1.55 \u03bcm (51.8 - 54.9 \u03bcm), hyaline tail terminus =11.45 \u00b1 0.65 \u03bcm (10.2 - 12.1 \u03bcm). The morphological characteristics matched the original description of M. hapla (Chitwood 1949). Males were not found. Matrix code for the polytomous key proposed by Castillo (Castillo et al. 2021): Female: A23, B43, C213, D1 (A, Body length; B, Stylet length; C, The excretory pore position in the female in relation to the stylet length (EP/ST) ratio; D, Perineal pattern morphology); J2: A3, B3, C34, D324, E32, F3 (A, Body length; B, Stylet length; C, Tail length; D, Hyaline region length; E, The long tail length to the short tail length ratio; F, The long hyaline region length to the short hyaline region length ratio). The DNA, extracted from six single females, was used for species identification, and 28S rDNA D2/D3 universal primers D2A (5'ACAAGTACCGTGAGGGAAAGTTG3') and D3B (5'TCGGAAGGAACCAGCTACTA3') were used (Nunn 1992). The DNA fragment obtained showed that the amplified sequences of the D2/D3 region (GenBank Accession No. MZ 570969, 769bp) shared 100% homology with the sequences of M. hapla (MN752204.1, MN752204.1, MN752204.1). Furthermore, species-specific SCAR primers JMV1 (5'GGATGGCGTGCTTTCAAC3') and JMV hapla (5'AAAAATCCCCTCGAAAAATCCACC3') were used as described by Dong et al. (2015). PCR produced 442-bp sequences. Fragments were sequenced (GenBank Accession No. OM 864510, 442bp) and compared with available sequences on NCBI. Sequences were 99%-100% identical to the M. hapla sequences (GenBank Accession Nos. AJ421708.1, GQ130137.1 and AJ421707.1). To verify the nematode pathogenicity on A. lancea, ten RKN-free A. lancea seedlings were transplanted into plastic pots. After 21 days, the roots of eight plants were inoculated with 1,200 J2s and eggs of M. hapla that were the same isolate collected from the field per plant and two uninoculated plants were used as control. Plants were maintained in a greenhouse at 25\u00b0C and 70% relative humidity with a 12-h/12-h light/dark photoperiod. After 70 days, all inoculated plants exhibited stunting and had scarce galling on roots. This is similar to those fieldgrown plants. No galling or symptoms were observed on the control plants. The nematode reproduction factor (RF = final population/initial population) was 2.3. These results had confirmed that the root-knot nematode population on A. lancea was M. hapla. The rhizome yields and quality of the A. lancea infected by M. hapla were seriously affected, which caused severe economic losses. Moreover, the infected plants tended to be more susceptible to some bacterial and fungal diseases, such as root rot disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. lancea as a new host of M. hapla in Hubei Province, China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, College of Pharmacy, The west NO.1 of Huangjiahu Road, wuhan, China, 430065."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Hubei Key Laboratory of Resources and Chemistry of Chinese Medicine, The west NO.1 of Huangjiahu Road, wuhan, China, 430065; hxiao0430@hbtcm.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuhan, China; 2209416435@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Chunchao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuhan, China; 1261089410@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, China; 465667892@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Lina", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuhan, China; 1287920751@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuhan, China; chenxin30172@hotmail.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuhan, China; 1220867756@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuhan, China; gl1224@163.com."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, ChinaWuhan, China, 430065; yukun_hbtcm@163.com."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["35973082", "10.1094/PDIS-04-22-0930-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
