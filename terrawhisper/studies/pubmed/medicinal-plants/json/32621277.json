It was reported that p38 signaling pathway played a key transcriptional regulatory factor in arsenic-induced apoptosis. However, there were certain disputable questions about this point of opinion. Therefore, the relationship between p38 signaling pathway and arsenic-induced apoptosis was systematically reviewed and analyzed by meta-analysis. Twelve essays were analyzed with StataSE15.0 and Review Manager 5.3. The regulatory variables, such as normal cells and cancer cells, arsenic exposure time and exposure dose were analyzed by the subgroup analysis. The comprehensive effects were compared and analyzed by SMD method. Publication bias, the monolithic impact and heterogeneity were inspected. Subgroup analysis showed, when arsenic exposure was \u2265\u20095\u00a0\u03bcmol/l, the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax was down-regulated and the expression of p38 and Caspase-3 was up-regulated. When arsenic exposure was <\u20095\u00a0\u03bcmol/l, the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, p38 and Caspase-3 was up-regulated. Arsenic exposure time (\u2265\u200948\u00a0h) or arsenic exposure dose (\u2265\u20095\u00a0\u03bcmol/l or\u2009<\u20095\u00a0\u03bcmol/l) can promote the expression of p38. Arsenic exposure time was \u2265\u200948\u00a0h or exposure dose was\u2009<\u20095\u00a0\u03bcmol/l in cancer cells, arsenic exposure dose was\u2009\u2265\u20095\u00a0\u03bcmol/l or exposure time was\u2009<\u200948\u00a0h in normal cells, and they are statistically significant in the expression of p38. This study evaluates the role of p38 signaling pathway in arsenic-induced apoptosis, which is helpful to provide theoretical basis for the differentiation of arsenic-induced injury and the therapeutic mechanism of arsenic-induced apoptosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Monitoring Control Ministry of Education, Guizhou Medical University, Town of University, Guian New District, Guiyang, 550025, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Liping", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Monitoring Control Ministry of Education, Guizhou Medical University, Town of University, Guian New District, Guiyang, 550025, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xi", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Monitoring Control Ministry of Education, Guizhou Medical University, Town of University, Guian New District, Guiyang, 550025, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Shaofeng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Monitoring Control Ministry of Education, Guizhou Medical University, Town of University, Guian New District, Guiyang, 550025, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Monitoring Control Ministry of Education, Guizhou Medical University, Town of University, Guian New District, Guiyang, 550025, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Changyan", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Monitoring Control Ministry of Education, Guizhou Medical University, Town of University, Guian New District, Guiyang, 550025, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Jian", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Monitoring Control Ministry of Education, Guizhou Medical University, Town of University, Guian New District, Guiyang, 550025, People's Republic of China. luopeng@gmc.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550014, People's Republic of China. luopeng@gmc.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "81860560", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "81660835", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "81160336", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "FAMP201802K", "Agency": "The open project of State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Geochem Health", "NlmUniqueID": "8903118", "ISSNLinking": "0269-4042"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N712M78A8G", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Arsenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ahmed, M.
