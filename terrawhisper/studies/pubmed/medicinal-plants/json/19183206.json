Many forest herbs are heavily browsed by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and a number of these are also harvested for the medicinal, floral, or horticultural trades. Previous studies of the viability of American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) have separately examined the effects of harvesting and deer herbivory. We followed individually marked ginseng plants in 6 populations for 8 years and documented deer browse levels, conducted helicopter surveys to estimate the deer herd size, and documented 2 ginseng harvests. We used this long-term data set to develop a stochastic demographic model that quantified the separate and interactive role of these threats to ginseng viability. Although harvesting and deer herbivory negatively affected ginseng population growth, their effects were not additive. Deer herbivory negatively affected population growth in the absence but not in the presence of harvesting. Life table response experiments revealed that in the presence of harvesting, deer herbivory had some positive effects on vital rates because browsed plants were less apparent to harvesters. Ginseng populations that were harvested responsibly (i.e., planting seeds from harvested individuals) had higher growth rates than those that were harvested irresponsibly. We concluded that both deer populations and harvesting must be managed to ensure sustainable populations of American ginseng. Our findings underscore the importance of long-term monitoring to assess threats to viability and the need for a broad ecological understanding of the complexity of ecosystem management."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a92008 Society for Conservation Biology."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forestry, University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO 65211, USA. susan.farrington@mdc.mo.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Farrington", "ForeName": "Susan J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Muzika", "ForeName": "Rose-Marie", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Drees", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Knight", "ForeName": "Tiffany M", "Initials": "TM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Conserv Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882301", "ISSNLinking": "0888-8892"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Deer"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Herbivory"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Life Tables"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Missouri"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Dynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19183206", "10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.01136.x", "CBI1136"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
