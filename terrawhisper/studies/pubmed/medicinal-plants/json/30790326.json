There is an urgent need for alternative antimicrobials to control fungal infections and targeting it by antifungal substances from the natural sources represents a promising new strategy for the development of novel antifungal agents. Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a phytoalexin produced by plant species in response to environmental stress or pathogenic attacks. It has many known and potential therapeutic applications in human general homeostasis; it mediates a great number of biological responses relevant for human health such as anticancer, cardio and neuroprotective, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities. Resveratrol is a natural antifungal agent, therefore it can be considered as a scaffold for designing structural relatives potentially capable of mediating more intense responses in a more specific way. Also, stilbenes produced by several plants may be useful lead structure for the chemical synthesis of antifungal. Their antifungal potential represents a useful solution to the drug resistance and side effect complications that occur after pharmacological treatment of infectious diseases. The purpose of this review is to present an overview on resveratrol derivatives, both natural and synthetic, with antifungal activity and summarize the chemical structure and the therapeutic versatility of stilbene-containing compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7718-5814"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Farmacia, Universit\u00e0 \"G. d'Annunzio\", Chieti, Italy."}], "LastName": "De Filippis", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Farmacia, Universit\u00e0 \"G. d'Annunzio\", Chieti, Italy."}], "LastName": "Ammazzalorso", "ForeName": "Alessandra", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Farmacia, Universit\u00e0 \"G. d'Annunzio\", Chieti, Italy."}], "LastName": "Amoroso", "ForeName": "Rosa", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Farmacia, Universit\u00e0 \"G. d'Annunzio\", Chieti, Italy."}], "LastName": "Giampietro", "ForeName": "Letizia", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Dev Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8204468", "ISSNLinking": "0272-4391"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Stilbenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Stilbenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30790326", "10.1002/ddr.21525"]}}]}
