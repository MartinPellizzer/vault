There is no reliable technique to detect and quantify tallow adulteration in butter samples in a feasible way. In this study a highly sensitive near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometric methods was developed to detect as well as quantify the level of tallow adulterant in clarified butter samples. For this investigation the pure clarified butter samples were intentionally adulterated with tallow at the following percentage levels: 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%, 9%, 11%, 13%, 15%, 17% and 20% (wt/wt). Altogether 99 clarified butter samples were used including nine pure samples (un-adulterated clarified butter) and 90 clarified butter samples adulterated with tallow. Each sample was analysed by using NIR spectroscopy in the reflection mode in the range 10,000-4000\u00a0cm<sup>-1</sup>, at 2\u00a0cm<sup>-1</sup> resolution and using the transflectance sample accessory which provided a total path length of 0.5\u00a0mm. Chemometric models including principal components analysis (PCA), partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA), and partial least-squares regressions (PLSR) were applied for statistical treatment of the obtained NIR spectral data. The PLSDA model was employed to differentiate pure butter samples from those adulterated with tallow. The employed model was then externally cross-validated by using a test set which included 30% of the total butter samples. The excellent performance of the model was proved by the low RMSEP value of 1.537% and the high correlation factor of 0.95. This newly developed method is robust, non-destructive, highly sensitive, and economical with very minor sample preparation and good ability to quantify less than 1.5% of tallow adulteration in clarified butter samples."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Mabood", "ForeName": "Fazal", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Abbas", "ForeName": "Ghulam", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Chemistry , University of Malakand , Malakand , Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Jabeen", "ForeName": "Farah", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Naureen", "ForeName": "Zakira", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c UoN Chair of Oman's Medicinal Plants and Marine Natural Products , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Al-Harrasi", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Hamaed", "ForeName": "Ahmad M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Javid", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Al-Nabhani", "ForeName": "Mahmood", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Al Shukaili", "ForeName": "Maryam S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Chemistry and Biology (DQB/CECEN) , State University of Maranh\u00e3o (UEMA) , S\u00e3o Luis , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Alamgir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Institute of Chemical Sciences , Bahauddin Zakariya University , Multan , Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Manzoor", "ForeName": "Suryyia", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "101485040", "ISSNLinking": "1944-0057"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fats"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ghee"}, {"RegistryNumber": "98HPY76U4W", "NameOfSubstance": "tallow"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Discriminant Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fats"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ghee"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Least-Squares Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Principal Component Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29267139", "10.1080/19440049.2017.1418090"]}}]}
