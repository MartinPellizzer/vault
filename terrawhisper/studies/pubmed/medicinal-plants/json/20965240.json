We demonstrated the regenerative potential of the plant extract on kidney affected by type 2 diabetes besides lowering blood glucose.", "The aim of the current study was to investigate the recuperative and regenerative potential of alcoholic stem extract of Nervilia plicata on streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced type 2 diabetic models.", "Non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) was induced in overnight fasted rats by intramuscular injection (IMI) of 60 mg/kg STZ and 120 mg/kg of nicotinamide after 5 min interval. Blood glucose was assessed by a glucometer, serum urea and creatinine levels were determined by diacetylmonooxime method and Jaffe reaction respectively. Kidney sections were taken and stained with Masson's tri-dye and Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) and examined for structural changes. Also lipid peroxidation product (LPP) levels were determined as thio barbituric acid reactive substance levels (TBARS) method.", "On administration of 5 mg/kg of plant extract, blood glucose levels of the NIDDM rats showed 62.00 and 76.29% decrease in the blood glucose levels on day 0 and day 30 respectively. Damages caused to the kidney tissue were negligible or not seen. Serum urea and creatinine levels showed 61.49 and 70.96% decrease on day 30. LPP levels of kidney and pancreas showed 70.58 and 77.41% decrease respectively.", "These results demonstrate significant antidiabetic and regenerative potential of the Nervilia plicata, justifying the use of plant in the indigenous system of medicine.
