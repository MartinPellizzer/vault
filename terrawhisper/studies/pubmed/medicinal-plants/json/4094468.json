Herbal treatments of the most frequently encountered illnesses or physical conditions--purge or constipation, skin affections, respiratory affections, indigestion, fever, bruises and sprains--were tallied from all available sources. The herbs most frequently used are common species, grown around habitations and in adjoining agricultural fields. The hypothesis is advanced that while the Hawaiian Islands contain one of the world's largest percentages of endemic species in the flora, only a few of these species were used for illnesses, though many endemic species were used for building, tapa making, and the foundation of the elaborate and renowned feather cloaks. Owing to approximately 1200 years of geographic isolation, the Hawaiians probably did not find it necessary to exploit the native flora for more than a token number of species for their relatively mild illnesses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abbott", "ForeName": "I A", "Initials": "IA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shimazu", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hawaii"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4094468", "10.1016/0378-8741(85)90089-3", "0378-8741(85)90089-3"]}}]}
