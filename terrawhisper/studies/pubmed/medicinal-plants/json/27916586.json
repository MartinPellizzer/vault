Spring, known as \"Cuiyuncao\", is a perennial herb widely distributed in the Southeast Asian countries. In the folk medicine, the local minority commonly use it to treat cough and asthma for centuries.", "This study was carried out to investigate the protective mechanisms of total flavonoids from S. uncinata (SUF) on airway hyperresponsiveness, cytokine release and bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) signaling with emphasis on inflammatory responses in a rat model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma.", "Rats were sensitized and challenged with OVA to induce typical asthmatic reactions. Pathological changes of lung tissue were examined by HE staining. The serum levels of T cell-associated cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13), total IgE and OVA-specific IgE were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Gene expressions of T2R10, IP3R1 and Orai1 in lung tissue were assayed by fluorescence quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) while protein expressions of NFAT1 and c-Myc were assayed by western blot analysis. The activation of SUF was investigated on tansgentic T2R10-GFP HEK293 cells.", "SUF treatment attenuated airway hyperresponsiveness and goblet cell hyperplasia compared with OVA-challenged asthmatic rats. The serum levels of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 as well as total and OVA-specific IgE were decreased while serum IFN-\u03b3 was increased in SUF-treated rats. SUF treatment significantly up-regulated T2R10 gene expression, down-regulated IP3R1 and Orai1 gene expression. SUF further suppressed eotaxin, NFAT1 and c-Myc protein expression in lung tissues of OVA-challenged rats.", "These results imply that SUF exerts anti-inflammatory function through the T2R10/IP3R1/NFAT1 dependent signaling pathway, and may warrant further evaluation as a possible agent for the treatment of asthma."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
