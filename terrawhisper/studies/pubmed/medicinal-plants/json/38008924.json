Here, essential oil was extracted from wild <i>A. annua</i> from Ningxia, China. GC-MS analysis showed that <i>A. annua</i> essential oil was dominated by artemisia ketone, a characteristic compound accounting for 31.26%, followed by eucalyptol (14.89%), camphor (8.69%), myrcene (8.25%) and \u03b1-pinene (6.65%). The overall antioxidative potential represented by DPPH and ATBS free radical scavenging rates was weak. The essential oil exhibited good bactericidal activities against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and fungicidal activities against <i>Trichophyton rubrum</i> and <i>Epidermophyton floccosum</i>. The minimum inhibitory and microbicidal concentrations were 0.02\u2009mg/mL and 5.12\u2009mg/mL for both bacteria, 0.315% and 2.5% for <i>E. floccosum</i>, and 0.625% and 5% for <i>T. rubrum</i>. The results suggest that <i>A. annua</i> essential oil may be an antimicrobial adjuvant to be applied in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Design, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research and Development Center of Aromatic Plants, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Design, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Le", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Sciences & Technology, Shanghai Ocean University, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xueqin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Design, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research and Development Center of Aromatic Plants, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wencui", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Design, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Design, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research and Development Center of Aromatic Plants, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yuhong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Design, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research and Development Center of Aromatic Plants, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38008924", "10.1080/14786419.2023.2281001"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
