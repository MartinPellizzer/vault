Unfortunately, the present approved drug, sivelestat, only alleviates the symptoms of the diseases caused by malfunction of HNE but not the disease progression. Therefore, there is a crucial need to search potent and safer molecules as elastase inhibitors and to develop better anti-inflammatory drugs in future. In addition, nature is the best architect that may provide a safer future drug candidate as HNEproduction/ activity inhibitor. Since phenolic natural products are already known as antiinflammatory compounds, either by acting as antioxidants or by any other mechanism, thus, this review article summarizes the discovery and elastase inhibitory activity of \u223c180 phenolics isolated from diverse natural sources during more than one decade, i.e. 2005-2017."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Baghdad-ul-Jadeed Campus, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, 63100 Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Saleem", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Government Sadiq College Women University, 63100 Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Nazir", "ForeName": "Mamona", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair of Oman's Medicinal Plants and Marine Natural Products, University of Nizwa, Postal Code 616, Birkat Al Mauz, Nizwa, Oman."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Hidayat", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Dera Ghazi Khan Campus, University of Education Lahore, 32200-Dera Ghazi Khan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Tousif", "ForeName": "Muhammad I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mansoura University, 35516 Mansoura, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Elsebai", "ForeName": "Mahmoud F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Baghdad-ul-Jadeed Campus, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, 63100 Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Riaz", "ForeName": "Naheed", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Government Sadiq College Women University, 63100 Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akhtar", "ForeName": "Naseem", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Antiinflamm Antiallergy Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101462262", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5230"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Serine Proteinase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.37", "NameOfSubstance": "Leukocyte Elastase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Elastase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Secretory Pathway"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Serine Proteinase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30198444", "10.2174/1871523017666180910104946", "AIAAMC-EPUB-92899"]}}]}
