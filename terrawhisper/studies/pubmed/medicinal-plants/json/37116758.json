Their use is steadily increasing and many patients with CVDs often combine HMs with prescribed cardiovascular medications. Interestingly, up to 70% of patients do not notify cardiologists/physicians the use of HMs and up to 90% of cardiologists/physicians may not routinely inquire them about the use of HMs. There is limited scientific evidence from well-designed clinical trials supporting the efficacy and safety of HMs and because they do not reduce morbidity and mortality are not recommended in clinical guidelines for the prophylaxis/treatment of CVDs. There is also a great deal of confusion about the identification, active constituents and mechanisms of action of HMs; the lack of standardization and quality control (contaminations, adulterations) represent other sources of concern. Furthermore, the widespread perception that unlike prescription drugs HMs are safe is misleading and some HMs can cause clinically relevant adverse events and interactions, particularly when used with narrow therapeutic index prescribed cardiovascular drugs (antiarrhythmics, antithrombotics, digoxin). Cardiologists/physicians can no longer ignore the problem. They must improve their knowledge about the HMs their patients consume to provide the best advice and prevent adverse reactions and drug interactions. This narrative review addresses the putative mechanisms of action, suggested clinical uses and safety of most commonly used HMs, the pivotal role of cardiologists/physicians to protect consumers and the main challenges and gaps in evidence related to the use of HMs in the prophylaxis and treatment of CVDs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
