This marker is mainly derived from molecular cloning of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). We have previously reported the use of an improved RAPD technique for the genetic characterization of different samples of Canarium album (Lour.) Raeusch (C. album). In this study, DNA fragments were amplified using improved RAPD amplified from different samples of C. album. The amplified DNA fragment was excised, purified from an agarose gel and cloned into a pGM-T vector; subsequently, a positive clone, called QG12-5 was identified by PCR amplification and enzymatic digestion and sequenced by Sanger di-deoxy sequencing method. This clone was revealed consisting of 510 nucleotides of C. album. The SCAR marker QG12-5 was developed using specifically designed PCR primers and optimized PCR conditions. This SCAR marker expressed seven continuous \"TATG\" [(TATG)n] tandem repeats, which was found to characterize C. album. Subsequently, this novel SCAR marker was deposited in GenBank with accession No. KT359568. Therefore, we successfully developed a C. album-specific SCAR marker for the identification and authentication of different C. album species in this study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Preclinical Medicine, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Genetics and Birth Health of Hunan Province, Family Planning Institute of Hunan Province, Changsha, Hunan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Lab of MOE for Development Biology and Protein Chemistry, Center for Heart Development, College of Life Sciences, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, Hunan, China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Z C", "Initials": "ZC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Preclinical Medicine, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, China."}], "LastName": "Mei", "ForeName": "Z Q", "Initials": "ZQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Preclinical Medicine, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences & the State Key Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "H C", "Initials": "HC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Lab of MOE for Development Biology and Protein Chemistry, Center for Heart Development, College of Life Sciences, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, Hunan, China xiushanwu2003@aliyun.com."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "X S", "Initials": "XS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Preclinical Medicine, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Judicial Authentication Center, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Genet Mol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101169387", "ISSNLinking": "1676-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Primers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Genetic Markers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Burseraceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Primers"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Markers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Minisatellite Repeats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis, DNA"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27706623", "10.4238/gmr.15038347", "gmr8347"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
