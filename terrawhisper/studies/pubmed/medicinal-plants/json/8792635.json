Southern hybridization of restricted chickpea genomic DNA with pea legumin pDUB6 and pDUB8 cDNA probes indicated presence of pea legumin homologous sequences in chickpea. About 4-5 kb EcoRI fragment was hybridized with both the probes used. DNA corresponding to this size was isolated from the gel and used for construction of subgenomic library in lambda ZAPII vector. After amplification, library was screened for presence of legumin genes in chickpea. Out of clones screened (0.1 x 10(6)), three positive clones were obtained. Restriction analysis and hybridization studies showed presence of complete structural gene in each of the identified positive clones."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Centre for Plant Biotechnology, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Mandaokar", "ForeName": "A D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Koundal", "ForeName": "K R", "Initials": "KR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Testing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genomic Library"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Legumins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8792635"]}}]}
