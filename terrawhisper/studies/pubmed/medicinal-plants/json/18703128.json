For the economically marginalized, access to such plants is largely through herbal markets which are part of an informal economy. Otherwise the formal natural products economy services those with a better socio-economic standing. Recently, the latter has experienced tremendous growth which largely mirrors the global cultural trend for organic naturopathies. Commercialisation of traditional plants and their contribution to the cosmeceutical, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries locally and abroad is reviewed. Traditional plant knowledge of southern African people is a source of inspiration for new product development. Concomitantly, an upsurge in research activities emanating from South Africa which confirms the pharmacological efficacy of these plants is fuelling a greater trust in indigenous flora. The escalating consumption of ethnomedicinals as highly valued commodities not only presents South Africa with socio-economic opportunities but also with challenges. Sustainable utilization benefiting the commodification of ethnoherbals, plus meeting aims of poverty alleviation and people empowerment, is a new paradigm in South Africa. The future sustainability of local ecosystems depends upon scientific conservation management practices that recognize the importance of involving local communities. Conservationists should remain aware and sensitive of socio-cultural dynamics within communities in order to manage natural resources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Zoology, Stellenbosch University, Private Bag X1, Matieland 7602, South Africa. makunga@sun.ac.za"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Makunga", "ForeName": "N P", "Initials": "NP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Philander", "ForeName": "L E", "Initials": "LE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}], "NumberOfReferences": "86"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18703128", "10.1016/j.jep.2008.07.020", "S0378-8741(08)00397-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
