Dietrich (Theaceae) is a native to Taiwan and the leaves have been used as an astringent folk medicine. Camelliin B (CB), a macrocyclic hydrolyzable tannin, was isolated from G. axillaris and showed cytotoxic effects in human carcinoma cells. Among the target cells (SKHep-1, Ha-22T, DU-145, AGS, and HeLa), the cervical carcinoma cell line, HeLa, was more sensitive to CB than were Chang normal liver cells and primary-cultured normal gingival and cervical fibroblasts. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effects of CB showed dose-dependency at 3.2-100.0 microg/ml in HeLa for 1,24,48, and 72 h and with an IC(50) value of 46.3 microg/ml for 48 h. However, the IC(50) value of CB in primary-cultured normal cervical fibroblasts was 108.0 microg/ml. Therefore, the selectivity shown by CB was ascribed to the difference in growth speed between normal and tumor cells. HeLa cells and primary-cultured normal cervical fibroblasts were treated with 50.0 and 100.0 microg/ml CB for 48 h, respectively, and exhibited chromatin condensation, indicating the occurrence of apoptosis. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated the presence of apoptotic cells with low DNA content, a decrease of cell population at the G(1) phase, and a concomitant increase of cell population at the G(2)/M phase. CB also caused DNA fragmentation and inhibited PARP degradation in HeLa cells. However, CB did not significantly inhibit Bcl-2 expression in HeLa cells at 50.0 microg/ml, only at 100.0 microg/ml for 48 h. These results suggest that CB induced apoptosis, without direct inhibition of Bcl-2 expression in HeLa cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Pharmacognosy Science, Taipei Medical University, 250 Wu-Hsing Street, Taipei 110, Taiwan, ROC."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "L G", "Initials": "LG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "L L", "Initials": "LL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Toxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "0361055", "ISSNLinking": "0300-483X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "126347-60-2", "NameOfSubstance": "camelliin B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.2.30", "NameOfSubstance": "Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Fragmentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Agar Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Theaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11684320", "10.1016/s0300-483x(01)00452-8", "S0300483X01004528"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
