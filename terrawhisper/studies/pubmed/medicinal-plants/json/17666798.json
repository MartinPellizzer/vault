CS is an important traditional herbal medicine widely used as a tonic and aphrodisiac to nourish the liver and kidney and to treat impotence and seminal emission. Rats were given a single intraperitoneal injection of DMN (40 mg/kg), and were then treated with CS daily by oral gavage for 4 d. Immunohistochemical studies for alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were performed, along with hydroxyproline and biological assay. Liver injury caused by DMN-injection was significantly inhibited in the CS-treated group compared to the silymarin-treated group. The results of blood biological assay were significantly protected by CS in serum total protein (T-protein), T-bilirubin (T-bili), D-bilirubin (D-bili), GOT, GPT, and ALP. The hydroxyproline content and amount of active alpha-SMA and PCNA were significantly decreased in the CS-treated group than in the silymarin-treated group. CS exhibited an in vivo hepatoprotective effect and anti-fibrogenic effects against DMN-induced acute liver injury and inhibited the formation of hydroxyproline, which suggests that CS may be useful in preventing fibrogenesis after liver injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, College of Oriental Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, 130-701 Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Eun-Young", "Initials": "EY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Eun Kyoung", "Initials": "EK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hyun-Sam", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sohn", "ForeName": "Youngjoo", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soh", "ForeName": "Yunjo", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Hyuk-Sang", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sohn", "ForeName": "Nak-Won", "Initials": "NW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Actins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkylating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "smooth muscle actin, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M43H21IO8R", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RMB44WO89X", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyproline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Actins"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Alkylating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyproline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17666798", "10.1248/bpb.30.1427", "JST.JSTAGE/bpb/30.1427"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
