Considering the high number of already available synthetic cannabinoids and the high rate of development of novel structures, we aimed to develop a generic method suitable for the analysis of a large panel of substances using seventeen synthetic cannabinoids from multiple classes as model compounds. Firstly, a suitable column was chosen after a screening phase. Secondly, optimal operating conditions were obtained following a robust optimization strategy based on a design of experiments and design space methodology (DoE-DS). Finally, the quantitative performances of the method were assessed with a validation according to the total error approach. The developed method has a run time of 9.4\u202fmin. It uses a simple modifier composition of methanol with 2% H<sub>2</sub>O and requires minimal sample preparation. It can chromatographically separate natural cannabinoids (except THC-A and CBD-A) from the synthetics assessed. Also, the use of mass spectrometry provides sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, this quality by design (QbD) approach permits the tuning of the method (within the DS) during routine analysis to achieve a desirable separation since the future compounds that should be analyzed could be unknown. The method was validated for the quantitation of a selected synthetic cannabinoid in fiber-type cannabis matrix over the range of 2.5% - 7.5% (w/w) with LOD value as low as 14.4\u202fng/mL. This generic method should be easy to implement in customs or QC laboratories in the context of counterfeit drugs tracking."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
