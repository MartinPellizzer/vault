(Rutaceae), a medicinal tree, was achieved by enhanced axillary bud proliferation in young single-node segments of a 25-year-old tree cultured in Murashige and Skoog (MS) nutrient medium. Bud break was dependent on cytokinin supply, but the synergistic combination of 2.5 mg l<sup>-1</sup> 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 1.0 mg l<sup>-1</sup> indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) induced the formation of 12.1 shoots of up to 5.2 cm length in 48% of the explants after 7 weeks of culture. Explants of in-vitro-grown shoots - node, whole leaf, shoot tip and internode - were subcultured in the presence of 0.05-2.5 mg l<sup>-1</sup> BAP to produce 11.3, 18.4, 5.3 and 3.2 shoots and shoot buds at a 100%, 70%, 95% and 40% rate respectively, in 7 weeks. Different shoot nodes and leaves were equally regenerative and adventitious organogenesis in the latter was confined to cut petiolar ends. Nodal explants responded most favourably at low BAP (0.05-0.1 mg l<sup>-1</sup>) and produced uniform (3.8-5.3 cm) shoots facilitating their simultaneous harvest for rooting. Repeated subculturing through five cycles of nodes and leaves of shoot cultures enabled continuous production of healthy callus-free shoots without any sign of decline. Shoot cuttings (3.0-5.2 cm) were best rooted in half-strength MS medium with 0.5 mg l<sup>-1</sup> IAA (70%) or 10.0 mg l<sup>-1</sup> indole-3-butyric acid (90%). Eighty-eight percent of the rooted plants were established in polybags after hardening."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Biotechnology Division, Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute, Palode, Thiruvananthapuram 695 562, Kerala, India Fax no: +91-471-431178, , , , , , IN."}], "LastName": "Ajithkumar", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Biotechnology Division, Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute, Palode, Thiruvananthapuram 695 562, Kerala, India Fax no: +91-471-431178, , , , , , IN."}], "LastName": "Seeni", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "9880970", "ISSNLinking": "0721-7714"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30736583", "10.1007/s002990050418", "10.1007/s002990050418"]}}]}
