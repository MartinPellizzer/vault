The order of the anti-complementary activity was IA-1 > IB-1 > IC-1. The polysaccharides appeared to be homogeneous from the results of gel filtration, HPLC and electrophoresis. The M(r)s of IA-1 IB-1 and IC-1 were estimated to be 56,000, 16,000, and 7000, respectively, by HPLC. IA-1 consisted mainly of arabinose (Ara), galactose (Gal) and glucose (Glc) in molar ratios of 1.8:1.0:0.9, whereas IB-1 and IC-1 were composed mainly of Ara, mannose (Man), Gal and Glc in molar ratios of 3.5:0.8:1.0:0.8 and 2.3:3.5:1.0:3.2, respectively. Methylation analysis, 13C NMR and enzymic digestion suggested that IA-1 mainly contained alpha-L-(1-->3,5)-arabinan, beta-D-(1-->6)-linked Gal and beta-D-(1-->3)-linked Glc. IB-1 also consisted mainly of alpha-L-(1-->3,5)-arabinan and beta-D-(1-->6)-linked Gal, whereas IC-1 was composed mainly of beta-D-(1-->4)- linked Glc and alpha- or beta-D-(1-->4)-linked Man."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oriental Medicine Research Center, Kitasato Institute, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Q C", "Initials": "QC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kiyohara", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7764377", "10.1016/s0031-9422(00)90512-0", "S0031-9422(00)90512-0"]}}]}
