Schum. were examined by capillary GC and GC-MS. Monoterpenoids composed 89.6% of the total identified constituents of the leaf oil, out of which 59.3% were oxygenated, represented mainly by terpinen-4-ol (28.4%) and 1,8-cineole (19.2%). The flower and leaf oils had a uniform qualitative, but different quantitative composition. However, the flowers oil was also dominated by oxygenated monoterpenoids (68.9%) viz., terpinen-4-ol (26.0%), 1,8-cineole (24.4%) and linalool (6.1%), along with the monoterpene hydrocarbon, sabinene (11.3%). On the contrary, the root oil had an entirely different composition and was characterized by endo-fenchyl acetate (40.1%), 1,8-cineole (11.8%), camphene (7.8%), bornyl acetate (6.9%) and borneol (5.8%). Moreover, endo-fenchyl acetate, exo-fenchyl acetate and endo-fenchol were characteristic of only the A. speciosa root oil."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP, CSIR), Resource Center, Pantnagar- 263 149, Uttarakhand, India. padaliarc@rediffmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Padalia", "ForeName": "Rajendra C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chanotiya", "ForeName": "Chandan S", "Initials": "CS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sundaresan", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Commun", "NlmUniqueID": "101477873", "ISSNLinking": "1555-9475"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alpinia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20334144"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
