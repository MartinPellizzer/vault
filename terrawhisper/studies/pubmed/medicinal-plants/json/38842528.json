Mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting various diseases, including chikungunya, filariasis, West Nile fever, dengue, malaria, and Zika fever, placing approximately 80% of the world's population at risk of infection at any given time. Controlling mosquitoes has become a multifaceted challenge, influenced by diverse environmental factors such as deforestation, urbanization, and climate change on a global scale. For centuries, medicinal plants have been utilized as bioinsecticides to control insect pests. Ziziphus mauritiana, also known as Chinese apple or Indian jujube is a deciduous thorny tree or shrub. Different parts of the Z. mauritiana plant have been traditionally used to treat various common diseases, a practice still prevalent in India and China.", "In the current investigation, the chemical properties of the Z. mauritiana leaf extract were examined through UV-Vis Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy (FTIR), and GC-MS Analysis. Second and fourth instar larvae, as well as pupae, of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus were subjected to different concentrations of the methanolic extract of Z. mauritiana for 24 h and 48 h to assess larvicidal and pupicidal activity.", "The FT-IR spectrum analysis revealed the presence of various functional groups in the chemical compounds extracted from Z. mauritiana , including amines, aromatics, alkanes, alkyls, carbonyls, and carboxylic acids. Additionally, GC-MS analysis identified Isoborneol (25.37%), 4-Acetylbutyric Acid (26.82%), and 2-Vinyl-9-[Beta-D-Ribofuranosyl] Hypoxanthine (24.24%) as the three major phytoconstitutents in the methanol extracts of Z. mauritiana. Regarding the larvicidal activity, the methanolic extract of Z. mauritiana exhibited LC 50 values of 155.67 mg/L and 208.57 mg/L for second instar larvae, and 177.68 mg/L and 252.13 mg/L for fourth instar larvae of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti, respectively, after 24 h of exposure. For pupicidal activity, the LC 50 values were 502.02 mg/L and 514.99 mg/L on pupae of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti, respectively, within 24 h.", "Overall, the GC-MS analysis provides valuable insights into the chemical composition of the Z. mauritiana extract, highlighting its potential as a natural and eco-friendly alternative for combating insect vectors and contributing to integrated mosquito management programs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Copyright: \u00a9 2024 Journal of Vector Borne Diseases."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Entomology Research Unit, Department of Zoology, St. Xavier's College (Autonomous), Palayamkottai, Affiliated to Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Sumathi", "ForeName": "Ganesan", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Entomology Research Unit, Department of Zoology, St. Xavier's College (Autonomous), Palayamkottai, Affiliated to Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Pushpanathan", "ForeName": "Thambusamy", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, University of Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Abhirami", "ForeName": "Muthukumar", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Vector Borne Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "101212761", "ISSNLinking": "0972-9062"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38842528", "10.4103/JVBD.JVBD_53_24", "01196045-990000000-00063"]}}]}
