Following characterization of CuS-NRs-AC were investigated by SEM, EDX, TEM and XRD, the effects of pH (2.0-10), amount of adsorbent (0.003-0.011g), MG concentration (5-25mgL<sup>-1</sup>), Pb<sup>2+</sup> concentration (3-15mgL<sup>-1</sup>) and sonication time (1.5-7.5min) and their interactions on responses were investigated by central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology. According to desirability function on the Design Expert optimum removal (99.4%\u00b11.0 for MG and 68.3\u00b11.8 for Pb<sup>2+</sup>ions) was obtained at pH 6.0, 0.009g CuS-NRs-AC, 6.0min mixing by sonication and 15 and 6mgL<sup>-1</sup> for MG and Pb<sup>2+</sup> ions, respectively. High determination coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>>0.995), Pred-R<sup>2</sup>-value (>0.920) and Adju-R<sup>2</sup>-value (>0.985) all are good indication of best agreement between the experimental and design modelling. The adsorption kinetics follows the pseudo-second order model and adsorption isotherm follows the Langmuir model with maximum adsorption capacity of 145.98 and 47.892mgg<sup>-1</sup> for MG and Pb<sup>2+</sup> ions, respectively. This adsorbent over short contact time is good choice for simultaneous removal of large content of both MG and Pb<sup>2+</sup> ions from wastewater sample."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
