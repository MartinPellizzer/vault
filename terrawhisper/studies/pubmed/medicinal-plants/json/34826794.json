In this study, bioactivity-guided phytochemical research on the active fraction of the roots of V. montana was carried out. As a result, seven undescribed terpenoids and lignans, together with thirty-one known components, were isolated and identified using comprehensive spectral analysis. All the identified compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on NO production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BV-2\u00a0cells. Combined with our previous research on the Vernicia genus, the effective material basis of different plants and medicinal components was analyzed systematically."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
