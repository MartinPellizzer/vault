Moreover, the chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts exhibited moderate affinity among all tested cell lines. Furthermore, the total phenolic and flavonoid contents were assessed. The molecular docking simulation was performed inside the effective sites of VEGFR-2 and TS as anticancer targets for the top ten phytochemicals. The results showed higher binding energy values for VEGFR-2 than for TS compared to vinblastine and co-crystallized ligands."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0000-8412-3486"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Department, Desert Research Center, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Youssif", "ForeName": "Youssif M", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8053-9203"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science (Boys), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Elhagali", "ForeName": "Gameel A M", "Initials": "GAM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science (Boys), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Zahran", "ForeName": "Medhat A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5219-5493"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Department, Desert Research Center, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Fatma A", "Initials": "FA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8542-7465"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science (Boys), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Biomaterials Research, Polymer Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia."}], "LastName": "Ragab", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38557274", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2335666"]}}]}
