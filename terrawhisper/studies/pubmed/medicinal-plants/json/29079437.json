Since, its aberrant expression is directly associated with the cell cycle and thus cancer. Therefore, MARK4 is being considered as a potential drug target for cancer therapy. Here, we investigated the mechanism of inhibition of MARK4 activity by citral. Docking studies suggested that citral effectively binds to the active site cavity, and complex is stabilized by several interactions. We further performed molecular dynamics simulation of MARK4-citral complex under explicit water condition for 100ns and observed that binding of citral to MARK4 was quite stable. Fluorescence binding studies suggested that citral strongly binds to MARK4 and thereby inhibits its enzyme activity which was measured by the kinase inhibition assay. We further performed MTT assay and observed that citral inhibits proliferation of breast cancer cell line MCF-7. This work provides a newer insight into the use of citral as novel cancer therapeutics through the MARK4 inhibition. Results may be employed to design novel therapeutic molecule using citral as a scaffold for MARK4 inhibition to fight related diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
