Viscosity of microemulsions was measured to investigate the influence of oliphase and waterphase carrying different dose drugs respectively. Polydispersity index, intensity mean, volum mean and number mean of microemulsion particles were detected to value the particles diameter and their disposition.", "Different oliphase, K.-value and waterphase had noticeable influence on the area of microemulsions and formulation composed of ethyl oleate, Solutrol HS15-EtOH (8 : 2), and the solution of Salvianolic acids, was the best one Viscosity of microemulsions was slightly influenced by oliphase and waterphase carrying different dose drugs respectively, but significantly influenced by the ratio of waterphase. The particles diameter and their disposition were also influenced by the ratio of waterphase.
