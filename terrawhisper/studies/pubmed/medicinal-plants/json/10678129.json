The cardiomyocytes were cultured in MEM (Eagle's) at 37 degrees C in the presence of 5% CO2 for 4 h. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was assayed by colorimetric method. Lipid peroxidation was determined by measuring thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. Ultrastructure was viewed under transmission electron microscope.", "Compared with the control group, LDH leakage and malondialdehyde (MDA) content increased in H2O2 group, LDH increased from (2166 +/- 247) U.L-1 to (5180 +/- 648) U.L-1, MDA increased from (3.5 +/- 0.2) nmol/10(6) cells to (7.2 +/- 0.4) nmol/10(6) cells (P < 0.01). The ultrastructure was damaged seriously. GbE inhibited the increase of LDH leakage and MDA content induced by H2O2. In this group, LDH decreased from (5180 +/- 648) U.L-1 to (3496 +/- 386) U.L-1, MDA decreased from (7.2 +/- 0.4) nmol/10(6) cells to (4.8 +/- 0.9) nmol/10(6) cells (P < 0.01).
