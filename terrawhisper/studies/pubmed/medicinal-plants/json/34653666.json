Accordingly, 540 common carp fingerlings were randomly allotted to 18 fiberglass tanks, including six treatments each in triplicate. Fish were fed with experimental diets supplemented with 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5% of the herbal mixture. After 60 days, the effects on growth performance, antioxidant, and immunological parameters were evaluated. According to the results, the highest final weight was observed in the fish fed 2 and 3% of the herbal mixture. Also, the feed conversion ratio (FCR) showed a significant decrease in fish treated with the herbal mix, so that the lowest FCR was observed in the treatment 1%. Hematological examinations such as red blood cells (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), and hemoglobin showed significant changes between different parameters compared to the control group. The highest protein content was observed in the fish supplemented with 2, 3, and 5% herbs. Besides, in contrast to glucose, the cortisol level showed a significant decrease compared to the control group. The digestive enzymes (Amylase, Lipase, and Protease) were significantly higher in 2 and 3% treatments than in the control group. Also, a significant difference was found in Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content between the experimental and control treatments. Examination of liver enzymes (and alanine aminotransaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)) showed a significant difference in herbal mixture treatments with the control group, according to which the lowest amount of these enzymes was recorded in 2 and 3% herb supplemented fish. Herbal mix resulted in higher mucosal and intestinal immunity parameters, including total immunoglobulin (total Ig), lysozyme, alternative complement activities (ACH50), protease, and ALP. According to the results, supplementing the diet with a mixture of the COP can significantly improve growth parameters, stimulate the innate immune system, and improve antioxidant defenses and liver health of common carp."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
