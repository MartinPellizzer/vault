In the study of compound, animal mode should be set up by the combination of modern experimental method according to TCM clinical requirements. A breakthrough in compound prescription needs to be found out from observation of pharmacodynamics and analysis of clinical therapy. Methodology and clarification of effective materials should be paid enough attention to in study the pharmacokinetics of the compounds. Since the therapeutic effects of compound prescriptions are different, or even opposite to itself under different Syndromes, it is so important to pay attention to Syndrome Differention. Multiple ways of TCM study have given active exploration on the developing of TCM academic level from different aspects. The aim of constructing a system of developing TCM and Syndrome-corresponding compound prescription is to build up a normalized standard of new and highly effective theory in treating disease clinically, designing methodology, Syndrome-corresponding prescription and monitor the compound prescription used. In this way, a new TCM clinical standard could be set up in Chinese medicine and its compound prescription in clinical experiments to raise the medical level continuously."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xiyuan Hospital of China Academy of TCM, Beijing 100091, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diagnosis, Differential"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Prescriptions"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research Design"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15015366"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
