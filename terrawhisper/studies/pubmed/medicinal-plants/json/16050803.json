In the VITOTOX test, none of the extracts were identified as genotoxic. In the comet assay, extracts of Acacia nilotica showed statistically significant DNA damage only in a concentration of 2500 ppm (highest tested dose), whereas extracts from Juglans regia showed significant damage in concentrations above 250 ppm and more. Extracts from Terminalia chebula and Tripahala significantly increased DNA damage in a concentration above 500 ppm. This is not considered contradictory, because DNA damage in the alkaline comet assay may not be permanent and hence may not necessarily result in mutations. All the extracts were previously found in the Ames assay to have potent antimutagenic effects against the direct acting mutagens NPD, sodium azide, and the S9-dependent mutagen 2-AF. The results of the previous study using the Ames assay are in conformity with those of the VITOTOX test. It was found that the extracts were safe in concentrations of up to 1000 microg/0.1 mL and 2500 microg/0.1 mL. A literature survey also showed that plant extracts can be mutagenic as well as antimutagenic depending on the test system used. This indicates that a battery of assays is needed before any conclusion can be reached."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botanical Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar 143 005, Punjab, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arora", "ForeName": "Saroj", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brits", "ForeName": "Ethel", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaur", "ForeName": "Swayamjot", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaur", "ForeName": "Kamaljeet", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sohi", "ForeName": "Rajbir S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Subodh", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Verschaeve", "ForeName": "Luc", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "8501420", "ISSNLinking": "0731-8898"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Acacia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Comet Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Juglans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "SOS Response, Genetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Terminalia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16050803", "10.1615/jenvpathtoxoncol.v24.i3.50", "3514f0af2eca0266,6e44d2895744f88a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
