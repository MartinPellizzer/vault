This review is an effort to analyse all the recent studies done to explore the anti-diabetic potential of traditional Gymnema species. Gymnema sylvestre (Retz.) R.Br. ex Sm. is an important member of the Apocynaceae family that has been used to treat a variety of diseases, the most studied of which is diabetes. This action is mostly due to the pharmacologically active phytoconstituents present in its extract, which include gymnemic acids, triterpenoid saponin glycosides, and so on. Numerous other Gymnema species have also demonstrated a similar pharmacological action.", "The goal of this study is to give a critical overview of the available data on Gymnema species that are used to treat diabetes. The major goal of this study is to give up-to-date knowledge on ethnopharmacology, botany, pharmacology, and structure-activity relationships of Gymnemaspecies from 2016 to 2020, as well as potential future research. The potential of using medicinal plants for alleviating symptoms of diabetes is recently being recognized. This review aims to summarize the available data and highlight both the potential and shortcomings of using Gymnema therapeutically. This knowledge can further be used to develop more therapeutically effective drugs derived from Gymnema.", "Data for Gymnema species was obtained using a mix of several search terms from online databases such as PubMed, SCOPUS, and Europe PMC. Other literature surveys relevant to traditional knowledge, phytochemistry, pharmacology, or structure-activity relationship activity were also used as reference. Several methods by which Gymnema species extracts exert their effects have been investigated, and a summary of the newly discovered chemicals isolated from the plant in the previous five years has been provided.", "SAR based evaluation has been carried out for a total of 27 pharmacologically active compounds belonging to three species of Gymnema genus (Gymnema sylvestre, Gymnema latifolium, and Gymnema inodorum).These compounds demonstrated the critical significance of plant medicines for diabetes management. Numerous heterocyclic compounds have anti-diabetic action and may serve as a starting point for the design and identification of new diabetes inhibitors.", "This study aims to provide researchers with a better understanding of the antidiabetic potential Gymnema species, as well as an outline of prospective future developments. It was concluded after studying the evaluation done in the last 5 years that although extracts of Gymnema have shown good antidiabetic potential, further modifications in the structures could result in the development of more potent and safer compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
