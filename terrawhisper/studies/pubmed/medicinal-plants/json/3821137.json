The plant is related to the zoapatle, traditionally used as a contraceptive, and known to have uterotonic and luteolytic activity. Kaurenoic acid, its 15 hydroxy- and its methyl ester were prepared from the polar fraction, and dissolved in 95% ethanol at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Human sperm, suspended in Bigger's Whitten and Wittingham medium at a final concentration of 15 million sperm per 500 mcl were incubated at 37 degrees C. for 60 seconds. Judging sperm motility under phase contrast microscopy, kaurenoic acid was 0.89 times less effective, and the hydroxy kaurenoic acid 2.6 times more effective than verapamil, while the keto derivative was 5.7 times more potent than verapamil at the same concentration. Sperm viability assessed by vital staining was hampered only about 10% by the keto-kaurenoic acid, 21% by kaurenoic acid, and 33% by hydroxy-kaurenoic acid. Doses required for immobilization of 50% of human sperms ranged from 58 to 374 mcg/ml. This is 225 times lower than that reported for gossypol in vitro, and much lower than the millimolar range needed to inactivate sperm with nonoxynol. Thus these drugs may prompt a search for analogs useful in vaginal contraceptives."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["044495", "00177445"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Americas", "Central America", "Clinical Research", "Contraception", "Contraceptive Agents", "Contraceptive Agents, Male", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developed Countries", "Developing Countries", "Drugs", "Economic Factors", "Family Planning", "Health", "Health Services", "In Vitro", "Latin America", "Medicine", "Mexico", "North America", "Plants, Medicinal", "Research And Development", "Research Methodology", "Sperm Immobilizing Agents", "Spermicidal Contraceptive Agents", "Technology", "Treatment"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "3821137", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1987", "Month": "03", "Day": "30"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "08", "Day": "29"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0378-8741", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "18", "Issue": "1", "PubDate": {"Year": "1986", "Month": "Oct"}}, "Title": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Ethnopharmacol"}, "ArticleTitle": "Zoapatle.
