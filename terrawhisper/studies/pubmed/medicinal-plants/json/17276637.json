Since no anti-TB drugs have been introduced in past 30 years, there is an urgent need to search for and develop new, effective and affordable anti-TB drugs. In this scenario, the plant kingdom with enormous chemical diversity may be looked as an important source of new anti-TB agents. Of 17,500 higher plant species occurring in India only about 365 species have been evaluated so far for antimycobacterial activity. The present review article describes the 255 (70% of 365) plant species from a wide range of families that have shown antimycobacterial activity. The species are enumerated in table format describing plant species and family, plant part used, type of extract and in vitro activity (MIC value), information on active compounds, if any, and uses in the ethnomedicine and Ayurveda. Interestingly, most of the plant species have shown strong positive ethnopharmacological correlation with the traditional knowledge. In addition, the recent in vitro screening methods for antimycobacterial activity are also described in brief. An attempt has been made to highlight the promising plant species for further investigation as leads for drug development."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Products, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), Sector-67, SAS Nagar (Mohali) 160062, Punjab, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gautam", "ForeName": "Raju", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saklani", "ForeName": "Arvind", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jachak", "ForeName": "Sanjay M", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mycobacterium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Mycobacterium Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Tuberculosis"}], "NumberOfReferences": "174"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17276637", "10.1016/j.jep.2006.12.031", "S0378-8741(07)00003-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
