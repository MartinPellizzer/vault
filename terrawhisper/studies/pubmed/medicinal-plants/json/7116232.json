The bacteriocin is rod shaped, approximately 20 nm wide and 75 nm long, and composed of an outer sheath and inner core. Both the producing strain, PsW-1, and a sensitive strain, 16, grew within red kidney bean stems. Strains PsW-1 and 16, or mutants derived from them, were injected into bean stems singly or in mixtures. All singly inoculated strains grew well. However, when the bacteriocin-producing strain was co-inoculated with the sensitive strain, the latter grew poorly, if at all. This was not due to competition for available nutrients, since the sensitive strain grew as well in the presence of a bacteriocin-nonproducing mutant as it did alone. Also, a bacteriocin-resistant mutant grew as well in the presence of a bacteriocin-nonproducing mutant as it did alone. Also, a bacteriocin-resistant mutant grew as well in the presence of the producing strain as it did alone. Bacteriocin activity and particles were recovered from infected plant tissue."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Smidt", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vidaver", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372707", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacteriocins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteriocins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7116232", "10.1139/m82-089"]}}]}
