A fast-growing perennial, guaran\u00e1 can be planted in the midst of manioc crops, allowing the formation of extensive orchards in the place of regenerating scrub once the manioc has been harvested. Traditional forms of guaran\u00e1 agriculture practised by the Sater\u00ea-Maw\u00e9 Indians compare favourably with the plantation system favoured by government agronomists. Indigenous techniques of hand-processing guaran\u00e1 are also shown to produce better quality in the finished product than those practices adopted by industrial concerns. A detailed comparison of two systems of production show the Indians' implicit concern to avoid oxidization of the phenolic compounds in the seed, since this leads to the guaran\u00e1 becoming dark in colour, bitter in taste, and irritating to the gastrointestinal tract. The short-term medicinal effects of guaran\u00e1 are commonly thought to result from a high content of caffeine and associated alkaloids, as well as from considerable amounts of tannin. Future research may well show that various saponins also play an important part in the drug's pharmacology, particularly with regard to its long-term influence as a general tonic and prophylactic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Henman", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3G6A5W338E", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["economics"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7154700", "10.1016/0378-8741(82)90054-x", "0378-8741(82)90054-X"]}}]}
