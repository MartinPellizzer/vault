Several chemotypes of W. somnifera include NMITLI-101, NMITLI-118 and NMITLI-128. The present work elaborates the optimization and development of a liposomal delivery system for efficient delivery of NMITLI118RT+ [a standardized ethanolic extract of a new chemotype of W. somnifera Dunal (NMITLI-118) roots] against cerebral stroke in rats. Liposomal systems were prepared using thin-film hydration method and characterized on the basis of size, zeta potential, physical stability, FT-IR, DSC-TGA analysis and surface morphological studies by TEM. NMITLI118RT+ and its formulations (NMITLI118RT+LF) were evaluated for biological activity utilizing middle cerebral artery occlusion model in rats. The Z average of the developed liposomal formulation was about 142.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\u2009nm with a zeta potential of -31.20\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0\u2009mV. Results of TEM revealed spherical particles in the range of 200\u2009nm. The entrapment efficiency was found to be 94.603\u2009\u00b1\u20092%. The formulation was found to be physically stable over a 3-week period. Results were suggestive of the fact that both NMITLI118RT+ and its delivery system possess significant neuroprotective activity in cerebral ischemia. The liposomal system largely exhibits better performance over NMITLI118RT+ precisely in the post-treatment group. The present studies could elucidate the successful development of a delivery system for NMITLI118RT+ and demonstrate their beneficial neuro-protective potential in overcoming and reversing the consequences of I/R injury following stroke."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Pharmaceutics."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Hafsa", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Pharmaceutics."}], "LastName": "Khandelwal", "ForeName": "Kiran", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Division of Pharmacology , and."}], "LastName": "Samuel", "ForeName": "Sheeba Saji", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Pharmaceutics."}], "LastName": "Tripathi", "ForeName": "Shivangi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Electron Microscopy Unit , CSIR - Central Drug Research Institute , Lucknow , Uttar Pradesh , India , and."}], "LastName": "Mitra", "ForeName": "Kalyan", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Metabolic and Structural Biology , CSIR - Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants , Lucknow , Uttar Pradesh , India."}], "LastName": "Sangwan", "ForeName": "Rajender Singh", "Initials": "RS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Division of Pharmacology , and."}], "LastName": "Shukla", "ForeName": "Rakesh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Pharmaceutics."}], "LastName": "Dwivedi", "ForeName": "Anil Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Drug Deliv", "NlmUniqueID": "9417471", "ISSNLinking": "1071-7544"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Stroke"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Withania"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26017242", "10.3109/10717544.2015.1041579"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
