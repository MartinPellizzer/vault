High concentrated p-mercaptoethanol was added in the RNA extracted buffer to remove polyphenols, phenol and chloroform were used to eliminate proteins, and isopropanol and sodium acetate were used to precipitate polysaccharides.", "The A260/A230 value of RNA extracted with improved method were all over 2.0 and the values of A260/A280 were between 1.7 and 2.0. The electrophoresis bands were cleared on agarosegel and integrity of RNA was good.", "The results showed that RNA obtained from the tubers, stems and leaves of P. ternate with this method had high purity and quality and could be used in molecular biological research, as DDRT-PCR and reverse Northern blotting analysis directly. This method is simple, economic, stable performance, and has a good repeatability as well as is suitable for extracting total RNA of medicinal plants with high concentrations of phenolics and polysaccharides."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Huaibei Coal Industry Teachers' College, Huaibei 235000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yue-qin", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "You-ming", "Initials": "YM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Jian-ping", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Northern"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Pinellia"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Tubers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Plant"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19007003"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
