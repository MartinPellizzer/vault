The standard Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) assessment chart was used for the evaluation. Safety was defined as an absence of direct estrogenic effects, serum inflammatory cytokines. Notably, interleukin IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor TNF-\u03b1, known to be directly related to estrogenic reactions in menopause studies, were monitored.", "The third clinical trial indicated an overall improvement in the four domains of MENQOL, offering further proof of the efficacy of DBT demonstrated in the two previous trials. The serial checks of the three cytokines related to estrogen activities did not show either upward or downward trends. The haphazard behavior reactions of the three cytokines offered indirect indications that DBT improved the MENQOL independently from estrogen activities.", "The three clinical trials using DBT to relieve menopausal syndrome have offered solid evidence for its efficacy. The uncertainty regarding whether the \"phytoestrogen\" contained in DBT had bioactivities similar to estrogen was alleviated through the confirmation that no strict estrogenic bioactivities were observed. The issue of safety was further clarified via laboratory platform studies on DBT, which not only showed the lack of similarity with estrogen actions but also confirmed the value of combining the two herbs in the classic formula."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 by The Korean Society of Menopause."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "Eliza L Y", "Initials": "ELY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Cheung", "ForeName": "Annie W L", "Initials": "AWL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Haines", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Pathology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Research on Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "Chun-Kwok", "Initials": "CK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Life Science and Center for Chinese Medicine, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Tsim", "ForeName": "Karl W K", "Initials": "KWK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Research on Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "William K F", "Initials": "WKF"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0195-4688"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Research on Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. pingcleung@cuhk.edu.hk."}], "LastName": "Leung", "ForeName": "Ping-Chung", "Initials": "PC"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "State Key Laboratory Fund", "Country": "Hong Kong"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "J Menopausal Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101632648", "ISSNLinking": "2288-6478"}, "CoiStatement": "No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Palacios S, Henderson VW, Siseles N, Tan D, Villaseca P.
