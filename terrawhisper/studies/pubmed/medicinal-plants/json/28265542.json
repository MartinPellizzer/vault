In this study, the possible orexigenic effect of hydro-alcoholic extract of <i>A. millefolium</i> was investigated by measuring plasmaghrelin level.", "Thirty male Wistar rats were divided into five groups. Control group received water. Treatment groups received 50, 100 or 150 mg/kg of <i>A. millefolium</i> extract for 7 days via gavage. Before the intervention, daily amount of the food eaten by each rat was measured for 10 days. During the investigation, the amount of energy intake of each rat was also estimated 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hr after each intake, for 7 days. Later, the orexigenic dose of extract and distilled water was fed to two separate groups of 6 male Wistar rats. Plasma ghrelin level was measured 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 hrafter extract intake.", "The change in energy intake after treatment by 50and 100mg/kg of the extract was significantly higher than other groups (p<0.001).Administration of Achillea 100mg/kg significantly (p<0.05) decreased ghrelin level one hrafter intervention but there was no significant (p>0.05) difference among control and treated group.", "This study indicated that <i>A. millefolium</i> had positive dose-related effects on appetite in rats. It seems that the orexigenicactivity of extract was not related to changes in plasma ghrelin levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry and Nutrition Research Center and Department of Nutrition, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nematy", "ForeName": "Mohsen", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry and Nutrition Research Center and Department of Nutrition, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mazidi", "ForeName": "Mohsen", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jafari", "ForeName": "Atefeh", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry and Nutrition Research Center and Department of Nutrition, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran ; Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Baghban", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rakhshandeh", "ForeName": "Hasan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry and Nutrition Research Center and Department of Nutrition, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Norouzy", "ForeName": "Abdolreza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Sciences Research Center, Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, School of Health, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Esmaily", "ForeName": "Habibollah", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Etemad", "ForeName": "Leila", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences, University of Roehampton, London SW15 4JD."}], "LastName": "Patterson", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammadpour", "ForeName": "Amir Hooshang", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Avicenna J Phytomed", "NlmUniqueID": "101586220", "ISSNLinking": "2228-7930"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Akamizu T, Iwakura H, Ariyasu H, Kangawa K.
