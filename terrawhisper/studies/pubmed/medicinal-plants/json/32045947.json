Its hypoglycemic activity in rats is comparable to that of the approved antidiabetic agent rosiglitazone. Therefore, CAA is a potential candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and a lead compound for the discovery of novel hypoglycemic drugs. To achieve a thorough understanding of the biological behavior of CAA <i>in vivo</i>, our current study was designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, distribution, and excretion of CAA in rats by UPLC-MS/MS. Chromatographic separation was performed on BEHC18 column (2.1\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009mm, 1.7\u2009\u00b5m). Quantification was performed under the negative ion mode by using single reaction monitoring (SRM) of the transitions of <i>m/z</i> 353.14\u2009\u2192\u2009309.11 for CAA and <i>m/z</i> 269.86\u2009\u2192\u2009224.11 for genistein, respectively. Standard calibration curve showed excellent linearity (r<sup>2</sup>\u2009>\u20090.99) within the range of 2\u200a-\u200a800\u2009ng/mL. The accuracies and precisions were within the acceptance limits (all <\u200920%). CAA was quickly absorbed into bloodstream and distributed rapidly and widely to various tissues. The excretion ratio of CAA in the 3 main pathways via bile, feces, and urine was only 5.17%. These results indicate that CAA was quickly and thoroughly metabolized <i>in vivo</i> and excreted mainly as metabolites."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New
