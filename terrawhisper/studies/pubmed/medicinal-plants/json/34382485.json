The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified mobile phone radiofrequency radiation as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). Humans being are inadvertently being exposed to EMR as its prevalence increases, mainly through mobile phones. Radiation exposure is unavoidable in the current context, with mobile phones being an inevitable necessity. Prudent usage of medicinal plants with a long history of mention in traditional and folklore medicine and, more importantly, are safe, inexpensive, and easily acceptable for long-term human use would be an appealing and viable option for mitigating the deleterious effects of EMR. Plants with free radical scavenging, anti-oxidant and immunomodulatory properties are beneficial in maintaining salubrious health. Green tea polyphenols, <i>Ginkgo biloba</i>, lotus seedpod procyanidins, garlic extract, <i>Loranthus longiflorus, Curcuma amada</i>, and <i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i> have all been shown to confer neuroprotective effects in validated experimental models of study. The purpose of this review is to compile for the first time the protective effects of these plants against mobile phone-induced neuronal damage, as well as to highlight the various mechanisms of action that are elicited to invoke the beneficial effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5537-1405"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenetics Lab, Department of Applied Zoology, Mangalore University, Mangalagangotri, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Raghu", "ForeName": "Shamprasad Varija", "Initials": "SV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Mangalore University, Mangalagangotri, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Kudva", "ForeName": "Avinash Kundadka", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biotechnology, National Institute of Technology Calicut, Calicut, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Rajanikant", "ForeName": "Golgodu Krishnamurthy", "Initials": "GK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Unit, Mangalore Institute of Oncology, Pumpwell, Mangalore, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Baliga", "ForeName": "Manjeshwar Shrinath", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Electromagn Biol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101133002", "ISSNLinking": "1536-8386"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Phone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electromagnetic Fields"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electromagnetic Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neurons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radio Waves"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34382485", "10.1080/15368378.2021.1963762"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
