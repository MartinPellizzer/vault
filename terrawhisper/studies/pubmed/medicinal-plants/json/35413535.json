The current regimen for PD treatment includes synthetic drugs that lack efficacy and cause serious side effects. Consequently, recent drug development studies are focusing on alternative medicines from plant sources. Artemisia pallens Wall. ex DC, commonly known as davana, is an annual aromatic herb cultivated in southern India. Given the diverse traditional and scientifically documented therapeutic effects of A.\u00a0pallens, the pharmacological potential of the isolates of the plant, namely bicyclogermacrene (D1), cis-davanone (D3), and cis-hydroxy davanone (D5), was tested for anti-Parkinson's activity in Caenorhabditis elegans model. The tested compounds alleviated \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) aggregation and maximum decline was observed in 25\u00a0\u03bcM D1 supplemented worms. Additionally, D1 modulated dopamine regulated nonanol-1 repulsion and locomotory behaviour of C.\u00a0elegans validating its future use as a dopamine-enhancing agent. The genetic regulation mediating the above effects validated through the qPCR study showed that D1 supplementation displayed its anti-Parkinson's effect through upregulation of the antioxidant defence system genes (superoxide dismutase (sod)-1, sod-2, and sod-4) and PD associated pdr-1 gene that maintains the mitochondrial proteostasis. The molecular docking studies of C.\u00a0elegans PDR-1 with D1 further confirmed its contribution in D1 induced abridgment of Parkinson disease linked pathologies in C.\u00a0elegans disease model. Hence, this article proposes D1 as an effective regimen for curtailing the Parkinson disease linked pathologies through mechanism of maintaining cellular redox state and proteostasis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
