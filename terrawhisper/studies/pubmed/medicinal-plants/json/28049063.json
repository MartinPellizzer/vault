The anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by testing the ability of the extracts to inhibit heat induced protein denaturation, stabilise human red blood cells under hypotonic stress and by testing the inhibitory activity of the extracts against cyclooxygenases 1 and 2. Cytotoxicity was tested using the human lung epithelial cell line MRC-5 and nasopharangeal carcinoma cell line HK1 in the MTT assay.", "Many of the samples showed an ability to prevent heat induced protein denaturation, as well as prevent lysis of red blood cells. Most of the extracts demonstrated inhibitory activity towards both of the COX enzymes. The ethanol extracts tended to demonstrate greater toxicity than other extracts, with some of the other extracts significantly enhancing growth and metabolism of the cells.", "The benefit of P. glaucus for the treatment of diseases related to inflammation and cancer was supported by the in vitro assays adopted in this study."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
