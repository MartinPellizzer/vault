Platycodon grandiflorus (Jacq.) A.DC. is an ethnic medicinal herb widely cultivated in China, and its dried root, Platycodi Radix (PR), is an important ingredient in herbal formulae for attenuating lung issues in Mongolian medical practice. However, research evaluating the superiority of PR based on harvesting regions is relatively limited.", "This study aimed to evaluate the qualitative superiority of PR from different regions based on anti-inflammatory effect.", "A total of three commercial PR samples were obtained from Anguo, Bozhou and Shangluo, and two wild samples were obtained from Chifeng and Hinggan. PR extract (PRE) was prepared by water distillation, and platycodin D content in the extract was examined by HPLC-UVD. An optimal dose of PRE was administered to BALB/c mice with S. pneumoniae pneumonia, and IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in lung tissue were examined by ELISA. HepG2 cells were treated with PRE, and an analysis of differentially expressed gene and functional enrichment was performed using an HTS<sup>2</sup> assay.", "The contents of moisture, total ash, crude extract and platycodin D in the raw roots met the quality control requirements outlined in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020 edition). The platycodin D content in the aqueous extract of the roots in descending order was 24.16% in PRE_Shangluo, 22.91% in PRE_Hinggan, 21.41% in PRE_Bozhou, 17.8% in PRE_Chifeng and 15.92% in PRE_Anguo. Furthermore, administration of PREs at an optimal dose of 2.0\u00a0g/kg resulted in some anti-inflammatory effect in mice with Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia, among which PRE_Shangluo administration exhibited a more obvious anti-inflammatory impact as shown by a significant decrease in the plasma white cell count (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and IL-10 level elevation and TNF-\u03b1 reduction in lung tissue (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) after treatment. In HepG2 cells treated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of each PRE, PRE_Hinggan and PRE_Shangluo resulted in significant differential expression of genes such as nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (NFKB1) and significant enrichment of pathways involved in the immune system, such as PI3K-Akt, MAPK and NF-kappa B signaling pathways.", "In this study, based on the anti-inflammatory effect, the quality of PR of Shangluo origin was superior to that of PR from the other four regions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
