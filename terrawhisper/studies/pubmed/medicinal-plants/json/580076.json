SPT and RAST were found to be reliable for the diagnosis of allergy to codfish, peas, nuts, peanuts and egg white. Positive SPT and RAST to cereals were common, but were most often without clinical significance or were correlated with respiratory allergy to the inhalation of flour dust. SPT and RAST were only partly reliable with regard to allergy to cow's milk, and were mostly reliable when used together and showing corresponding results. Experimental allergosorbents for RAST with soy beans and white beans were not reliable. The study shows the need to improve the diagnostic materials and to establish the diagnostic reliability of the material and tests used for each food item in question."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aas", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Clin Allergy", "NlmUniqueID": "0311172", "ISSNLinking": "0009-9090"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Arachis"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Eczema"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Egg White"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nuts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radioallergosorbent Test"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["580076", "10.1111/j.1365-2222.1978.tb00446.x"]}}]}
