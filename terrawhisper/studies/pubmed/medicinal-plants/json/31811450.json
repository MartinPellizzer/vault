While zinc-protein profile was screened in plant samples using the online coupling of size exclusion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (SEC-ICP-MS), total zinc contents and zinc water extract contents were determined using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The analysis of two certified reference materials with similar matrix for total zinc content revealed recovery values of 97.1% and 100.5% while the average of recovery of the summed Zn concentrations from protein fractions compared to total Zn was 103.0\u2009\u00b1\u20094.8%. Based on the FAO/WHO classification, Sesamum indicum, Nigella sativa, Trigonella Foenum-graecum and Pennisetum glaucum are classified as highest Zn-content. For protein profile, zinc was quantified in 330-430 and 50-60\u00a0kDa fractions of all examined plants while no contents were quantified in the inorganic fraction 0.05-0.4\u00a0kDa of all plant species. Also, only three plant species recorded Zn contents in the phytate fraction (0.9-1.5\u00a0kDa fraction). The fruits of the Momordica Charantia and the Citrullus colocynthis were with the highest extractable zinc concentration; 13.55\u2009\u00b1\u20090.45 and 10.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.63\u00a0mg/kg, respectively. The highest Zinc capturing capacity was reported for the 50-60 and 70-87 KDa protein fractions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research and Consulting Institute, King Faisal University, Hofuf, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sudan Atomic Energy Commission, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Ebrahim", "ForeName": "Ammar M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, College of Science, King Faisal University, Hofuf, 31982, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alnajjar", "ForeName": "Ahmed O", "Initials": "AO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Clinical Pharmacy, King Faisal University, Hofuf, 31982, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, Zagazig University, Zagazig, 44519, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mohammed", "ForeName": "Maged E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4038-4769"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, College of Science, King Khalid University, Abha, 61321, Saudi Arabia. abubakridris@hotmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Advanced Materials Science (RCAMS), King Khalid University, P.O.
