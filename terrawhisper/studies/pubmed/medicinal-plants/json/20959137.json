Vascular reactivity and superoxide generation were assessed in aortic rings using standard organ bath techniques and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence, respectively.", "Eight weeks after STZ treatment blood glucose was elevated compared to citrate treated control rats and there was an increased aortic generation of superoxide anion. In aortic rings acetylcholine-induced relaxation was impaired whereas endothelium-independent relaxation to sodium nitroprusside was unaffected. When aortic rings were acutely exposed to KPE (1, 10 and 100 \u03bcg/ml) there was a significant reduction in the detection of superoxide anion and enhanced relaxation to acetylcholine. Two separate groups of rats (control and diabetic) were orally administered daily with KPE (100 mg/kg body weight) for 4 weeks. KPE treatment reduced superoxide generation and increased the nitrite levels in diabetic aortae, and enhanced acetylcholine-induced relaxation. In the presence of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), the relaxation to acetylcholine in aortic rings of diabetic rats was only partially inhibited, but was totally abolished in aortic rings from the KPE-treated diabetic rats. Indomethacin did not affect relaxation to acetylcholine in aortic rings of any group.", "These results suggest that KPE, acutely in vitro or after 4 weeks administration in vivo, reduces oxidant stress, increases NO bioavailability and preserves endothelium-dependent relaxation in aortae from diabetic rats."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
