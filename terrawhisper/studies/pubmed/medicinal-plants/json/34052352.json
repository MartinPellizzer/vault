Plants and their extracts are also well-known phytobiotics or phytogenics that are widely used in animal traditional and alternative medicine. In recent years the use of herbal/plant medicine is increased in livestock production due to the side effects of modern drugs, the high input costs, toxic residues in food, microbial resistance and due to the development of organic livestock production systems. Plants are used as health promoters and also for the treatment of diseases.", "This review aims to provide information on various plants used in animal health care, production and reproduction in various forms.", "We carefully searched the scientific literature for data related to traditional scientific use of herbal products in animal production. This review summarized published literature collected from library, the online databases, and various scientific search engines including PubMed, Elsevier, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Scopus, and Research gate. The Plant List (www.theplantlist.org) databases were used to provide the scientific names, subspecies of plants.", "Various herbs play important role in production and reproduction of animal. Herbs acts as feed additives, growth promoters, immune boosters, improves reproduction in animals and also helps in reduction of methane and ammonia emission. Secondary metabolites like Tanins, saponin, flavonoids and essential oils are the most used for rumen manipulation and have great potential in poultry and pig nutrition.", "The traditional knowledge may play important role, hence documentation and preservation is a must before it is lost forever.
