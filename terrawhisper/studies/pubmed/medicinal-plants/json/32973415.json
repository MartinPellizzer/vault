Herein, 4 crude extracts obtained from sequential partition of aqueous extract of <i>Rhizoma coptidis</i> with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol exhibited antifeedant activity against <i>Spodoptera litura</i> (Fabricius) larvae at high doses and inducing activity at low doses. Furthermore, a similar biphasic dose-response of the antifeedant activity against <i>S litura</i> larvae was also observed for jateorhizine, palmatine, and obakunone in <i>Coptis chinensis</i>. Notably, the enzyme activities of glutathione-S-transferase and carboxyl esterase in <i>S litura</i> larvae affected by the different components (jateorhizine, palmatine, obakunone, berberine, and coptisine) of <i>C chinensis</i> also showed a biphasic dose-response with an increasing trend at low doses and a decreasing trend at high doses. Together, our study suggests that the components of <i>C chinensis</i> may play a chemical defensive role against <i>S litura</i> larvae in a hormetic manner."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmaceutical Sciences and College of Chinese Medicine, Southwest University, Chongqing, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Houhui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmaceutical Sciences and College of Chinese Medicine, Southwest University, Chongqing, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmaceutical Sciences and College of Chinese Medicine, Southwest University, Chongqing, China."}], "LastName": "Ni", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmaceutical Sciences and College of Chinese Medicine, Southwest University, Chongqing, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmaceutical Sciences and College of Chinese Medicine, Southwest University, Chongqing, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmaceutical Sciences and College of Chinese Medicine, Southwest University, Chongqing, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Zanyang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmaceutical Sciences and College of Chinese Medicine, Southwest University, Chongqing, China."}], "LastName": "Pang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0564-3892"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmaceutical Sciences and College of Chinese Medicine, Southwest University, Chongqing, China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Hongyi", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Dose Response", "NlmUniqueID": "101308899", "ISSNLinking": "1559-3258"}, "CoiStatement": "Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Harborne JB.
