On a scientific basis phytopharmaceuticals are used for therapy in a variety of diseases in the clinic as well as in medical practice.

The relatively more frequent use of phytopharmaceuticals by the practitioner is related to the fact that he is mainly concerned with mild health disturbances and diseases and chronic sufferings which are destined for treatment with herbal medicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Klinik I f\u00fcr Innere Medizin der Universit\u00e4t zu K\u00f6ln, Germany."}], "LastName": "Reuter", "ForeName": "H D", "Initials": "HD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Family Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "0"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1881156", "10.1016/0378-8741(91)90116-u", "0378-8741(91)90116-U"]}}]}
