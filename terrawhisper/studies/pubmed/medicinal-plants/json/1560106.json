This led to the purification of 10 PSbMV isolates by a single procedure. Virus aggregation during purification did not occur and consequently, high virus yield was consistently obtained. The virus thus purified was suitable for preparing viral genomic RNA, although conventional methods for RNA extraction resulted in RNA degradation. An alternative method was adopted which yielded reproducibly full length and infectious RNA. This was applied to three isolates of PSbMV and the RNA used to direct complementary DNA synthesis which in turn yielded nearly full length cDNA products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "John Innes Centre for Plant Science Research, Norwich, U.K."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hayes", "ForeName": "I M", "Initials": "IM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maule", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Virol Methods", "NlmUniqueID": "8005839", "ISSNLinking": "0166-0934"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Virology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1560106", "10.1016/0166-0934(92)90053-g", "0166-0934(92)90053-G"]}}]}
