Presently, dietary supplements are generally standardized to contain specified levels of hypericin and hyperforin, and the related compounds, pseudohypericin and adhyperforin. A rapid method was developed for simultaneous determination of these 4 active constituents by liquid chromatography (LC). A 1 g portion of dried, finely ground leaf/flower sample is extracted with 20 mL methanol for 2 h. A 0.6 mL aliquot of the crude extract is combined with 5.4 mL acetonitrile-methanol (9 + 1) and passed through a mixed solid-phase cleanup column. The eluate is examined by LC for hyperforin, adhyperforin, hypericin, and pseudohypericin on a Hypersil reversed-phase column by using simultaneous ultraviolet (284 nm) and fluorescence detection (excitation, 470 nm; emission, 590 nm). The compounds are easily separated isocratically within 8 min with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-aqueous 0.1 M triethylammonium acetate (8 + 2). Average recoveries of hyperforin and adhyperforin were 101.9 and 98.4%, respectively, for 3 sample mixtures containing concentrations ranging from approximately 0.2 to 1.5% combined hyperforins per gram dry weight. Average relative standard deviation (RSD) values for hyperforin and adhyperforin for all 3 mixtures were 18.9 and 18.0%, respectively. Average recoveries of hypericin and pseudohypericin were 88.6 and 93.3% respectively, from 3 sample mixtures containing concentrations ranging from approximately 0.2 to 0.4% combined hypericins per gram dry weight. Average RSD values for hypericin and pseudohypericin for all 3 mixtures were 3.8 and 4.2%, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Missouri, Department of Forestry, Columbia 65211, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gray", "ForeName": "D E", "Initials": "DE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rottinghaus", "ForeName": "G E", "Initials": "GE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garrett", "ForeName": "H E", "Initials": "HE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pallardy", "ForeName": "S G", "Initials": "SG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gray", "ForeName": "D E", "Initials": "DE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rottinghaus", "ForeName": "G E", "Initials": "GE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garrett", "ForeName": "H E", "Initials": "HE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pallardy", "ForeName": "S G", "Initials": "SG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J AOAC Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9215446", "ISSNLinking": "1060-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetonitriles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthracenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5QD5427UN7", "NameOfSubstance": "Perylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7V2F1075HD", "NameOfSubstance": "hypericin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DHD7FFG6YS", "NameOfSubstance": "Phloroglucinol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MQ0U4663ZO", "NameOfSubstance": "pseudohypericin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RM741E34FP", "NameOfSubstance": "hyperforin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z072SB282N", "NameOfSubstance": "acetonitrile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetonitriles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anthracenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Perylene"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Phloroglucinol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10995119"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
