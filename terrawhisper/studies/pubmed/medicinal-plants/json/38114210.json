Terpene synthases(TPSs) are key enzymes in the synthesis process of terpenoids. In order to investigate the TPS gene family members and their potential functions in Schizonepeta tenuifolia, this study conducted a systematic analysis of the TPS gene family of S. tenuifolia based on the whole genome data of S. tenuifolia using bioinformatics methods. The results revealed 57 StTPS members identified from the genome database of S. tenuifolia. The StTPS family members encoded 285-819 amino acids, with protein molecular weights ranging from 32.75 to 94.11 kDa, all of which were hydrophilic proteins. The StTPS family members were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm and chloroplasts, exhibiting a random and uneven physical localization pattern. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the StTPS genes family were divided into six subgroups, mainly belonging to the TPS-a and TPS-b subfamilies. Promoter analysis predicted that the TPS gene family members could respond to various stressors such as light, abscisic acid, and methyl jasmonate(MeJA). Transcriptome data analysis revealed that most of the TPS genes were expressed in the roots of S. tenuifolia, and qRT-PCR analysis was conducted on genes with high expression in leaves and low expression in roots. Through the analysis of the TPS gene family of S. tenuifolia, this study identified StTPS5, StTPS18, StTPS32, and StTPS45 as potential genes involved in sesquiterpene synthesis of S. tenuifolia. StTPS45 was cloned for the construction of an prokaryotic expression vector, providing a reference for further investigation of the function and role of the TPS gene family in sesquiterpene synthesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Cong-Ling", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Shu", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Dang", "ForeName": "Jing-Jie", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xue", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization Nanjing 210023, China National and Local Collaborative Engineering Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization and Formulae Innovative Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Qi-Nan", "Initials": "QN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chan-Chan", "Initials": "CC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "terpene synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "45"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38114210", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20230712.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
