This study was designed to study the adjuvant effect of kaempferol administration along with ovalbumin antigen (K\u2009+\u2009O) in balb/c mice.", "Mice were immunized with kaempferol (100 and 50\u2009mg/kg body weight) without or with ovalbumin (20\u2009\u00b5g/mouse). After priming, booster was administered on day 21. Antigen specific IgG titers and its subtypes, on day 28, were estimated by indirect ELISA. Effect of kaempferol administration on CD11c<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup> peritoneal dendritic cells was studied by flow cytometry. Expression levels of proteins Tbx21, GATA-3, BLIMP-1, Caspase-1 and Oct-2 were studied by western blotting. LPS activated IL-1\u03b2 production by peritoneal cells of immunized mice was estimated by sandwich ELISA.", "Ovalbumin specific IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibody titers in sera samples of K\u2009+\u2009O immunized mice increased significantly (p\u2009<\u2009.01) as compared to controls. The enhanced Th1 and Th2 immune response in K\u2009+\u2009O immunized mice was also supported by the increased expression of Tbx21 and GATA-3 transcription factors in splenocytes. This corroborated with increased BLIMP-1 and Oct-2 protein expression. Kaempferol increased the infiltration of peritoneal CD11c<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells but failed to enhance LPS activated IL-1\u03b2 by peritoneal macrophages and suppressed caspase-1 protein expression as compared to that in ovalbumin immunized mice.", "Present study strongly demonstrates the novel adjuvant activity of kaempferol in vivo and its potential as an immunostimulatory agent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Immunomodulation Laboratory , Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences , Delhi , India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Divya", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Immunomodulation Laboratory , Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences , Delhi , India."}], "LastName": "Tanwar", "ForeName": "Himanshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Immunomodulation Laboratory , Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences , Delhi , India."}], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "Sudeshna", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Immunomodulation Laboratory , Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences , Delhi , India."}], "LastName": "Ganju", "ForeName": "Lilly", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Immunomodulation Laboratory , Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences , Delhi , India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Shashi Bala", "Initials": "SB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8800150", "ISSNLinking": "0892-3973"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CD11c Antigen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "GATA3 Transcription Factor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gata3 protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Kaempferols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "T-Box Domain Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "T-box transcription factor TBX21"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "CD11c Antigen"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Dendritic Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "GATA3 Transcription Factor"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Kaempferols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Peritoneal Cavity"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Box Domain Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Th1 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Th2 Cells"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29486619", "10.1080/08923973.2018.1434794"]}}]}
