Then the rabbits were assigned into treatment group (n = 15) and control group (n = 15). Tanshinone II A sulfonic acid natrium was injected intravenously in treatment group. Saline was venously injected in control group. The balloon injured arteries were harvested in the 7th, 14th, and 28th days after surgery.", "Analysis of Collagen fibers staining found that a weak positive staining was shown at the 7th day post-operation in both groups,while a strong positive result was seen at the 14th day in control group. Positive results were even shown at the 14th day in treatment group,but less strong than that of the control. At the 28th day post-operation, collagen fiber staining become weak in treatment group, but increased in the control. Difference between both group in the 28th day post-operation was significant (P = 0.017).
