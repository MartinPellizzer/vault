This study was designed to investigate whether VB could play a cardioprotective role in septic heart injury.", "Mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10\u00a0mg/kg) to induce sepsis. The treatment group received an intraperitoneally injection of VB (20\u00a0mg/kg) before LPS challenge. Transthoracic echocardiography, ELISA, immunofluorescence, and qPCR were performed to assess the effect of VB on heart function, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. Transmission electronic microscopy and immunoblotting were used to evaluate the mitochondrial morphology and biogenesis of the septic heart. In vitro experiments were also performed to repeat above-mentioned assays.", "Compared with LPS group, the VB treatment group showed improved cardiac function in sepsis. VB alleviated oxidative stress and inflammatory cell infiltration, as well as cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Specifically, VB could restore sepsis-induced mitochondrial alterations via regulating mitochondrial biogenesis. These results were also confirmed in in vitro experiments.", "Verbascoside could protected from sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy by inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, as well as promoting mitochondrial biogenesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
