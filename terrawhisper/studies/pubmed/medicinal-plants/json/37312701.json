Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the possible effects of date palm pollen supplementation on the heifer's puberty. This study was conducted in Najaf- Iraq, on 10 crossbred heifers 6 months old, from December 1<sup>st</sup>, 2021, to August 1<sup>st</sup>, 2022. The animals were divided randomly into two groups: T1 was supplemented with 2g of date palm pollen (DPP) plus the main ration, while T2 was supplemented only with the main ration. The results revealed a significant effect (<i>P</i><0.05 and <i>P</i><0.01) in T1 over T2, accelerating the heifer's puberty and sexual maturity. The results also showed a significant effect (<i>P</i><0.01) between T1 and T2 at the level of the hormones FSH, LH and estrogen in the age of puberty, as well as the presence of a significant difference (<i>P</i><0.01) and (<i>P</i><0.05) between T1 and T2 at the level of the hormones FSH and estrogen in the age of sexual maturity. The results also showed a significant effect (<i>P</i><0.05) for T1 and T2 in weight at puberty and maturity. This study aimed to accelerate puberty and sexual maturity in the heifers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Production, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Kufa, Najaf, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Al-Abbasi", "ForeName": "H H H", "Initials": "HHH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Production, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Kufa, Najaf, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Mahdi", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Production, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Kufa, Najaf, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Washam", "ForeName": "A F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Production, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Kufa, Najaf, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Al-Wazeer", "ForeName": "A A M", "Initials": "AAM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial, Veterinary"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Arch Razi Inst", "NlmUniqueID": "101549567", "ISSNLinking": "0365-3439"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-68-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Follicle Stimulating Hormone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Estrogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follicle Stimulating Hormone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iraq"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phoeniceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sexual Maturation"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Ara\u00fajo de Oliveira AC, da Silva L\u00e9do A, Polek M, Krueger R, Shepherd A, Volk GM.
