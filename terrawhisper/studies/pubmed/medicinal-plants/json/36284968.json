Moreover, they are utilized to evaluate different concentrations of aqueous and alcoholic extracts of <i>Averrhoa bilimbi</i> leaves and antibiotics against bacteria isolated from the oral cavity. This study was conducted simultaneously at the Departments of Botany and Biology, Shatrah Hospital, Thi-Qar, Iraq, during March and August 2021. <i>A. bilimbi</i> leaf extracts were utilized in the plant component examination and the assessment of the antibacterial activity. The bacterial strain of <i>Escherichia coli</i>\u00a0and\u00a0<i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> was isolated from the oral cavity. To test the antibacterial impact of the extracts on bacteria, the agar well diffusion method was used. The phytochemical screening indicated the presence of Alkaloids, Flavonoids, Sapiens, Steroids, Tannins, Glycosides, and Carbohydrates, followed by the absence of Tannins in aqueous extract. Due to the <i>A. bilimbi</i> leaf aqueous and methanol extract against <i>E. coli</i>, areas of inhibition were found (0.20 cm and 0.19 cm) at the concentration of 100 mg/ml, respectively. However, there were no regions of inhibition of the <i>K. pneumoniae</i> trend for both extracts. The sensitivity of bacterial isolates of <i>E. coli</i> and <i>K. pneumonia</i> to antibiotics was also tested through Gentamicin, Amoxycillin, Azithromycin, Ciprofloxacin, Penicillin, and Polymyxin B, and the regions of inhibition appeared against <i>E. coli</i> (0.5cm, 0 cm, 0.34 cm, 0.45 cm, 0 cm, and 0.12 cm, respectively). Furthermore, the regions of inhibition appeared against K. pneumoniae (3 cm, 0.3 cm, 0.4 cm, 0.55 cm, 0 cm, 0.66 cm, respectively). The antibiotics showed a higher inhibition zone, compared to the aqueous and alcoholic extracts; however, further studies are required to be conducted to validate its reliability."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Thi-Qar Education Directorate, Thi-Qar, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Mohammed Atiyah", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Thi-Qar Education Directorate, Thi-Qar, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Shnawa Jasim", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Assistant Lecturer, Department of Biology, College of Education for Girls, University of Thi-Qar, Thi-Qar, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Mohammed Atiyah", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Arch Razi Inst", "NlmUniqueID": "101549567", "ISSNLinking": "0365-3439"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9002-18-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Agar"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "804826J2HU", "NameOfSubstance": "Amoxicillin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "83905-01-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Azithromycin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5E8K9I0O4U", "NameOfSubstance": "Ciprofloxacin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gentamicins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Penicillins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J2VZ07J96K", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymyxin B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amoxicillin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Averrhoa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Azithromycin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ciprofloxacin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gentamicins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mouth"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Penicillins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymyxin B"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Mohapatra S, Pattnaik M, Ray P.
