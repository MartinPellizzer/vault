(Plumbaginaceae). A single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody, fusion of the variable regions of the heavy chain and light chain of immunoglobulin against PL (PL-scFv) was expressed by Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System using Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells and characterized to investigate potential use of PL-scFv as a tool for plant immunomodulation. Functional PL-scFv expressed in the Sf9 insect cells were purified using cation exchange chromatography followed by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). The yields of the purified PL-scFv in the culture supernatant and Sf9 insect cells were 2.0 mg and 5.2 mg per 1 liter of Sf9 culture medium, respectively. Recombinant purified PL-scFv was then characterized by the indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The cross-reactivity and sensitivity of PL-scFv expressed in Sf9 insect cells were compared with PL-scFv expressed in Escherichia coli and its parental anti-plumbagin monoclonal antibody (MAb 3A3) secreted from hybridoma cells. Intriguingly, the specificity of the PL-scFv expressed in Sf9 insect cells was found to be different from that expressed in E. coli and parental MAb 3A3, although the detectable level (0.2-25 \u03bcg/mL) was the same in ELISA using each antibody. Even more interestingly, the characteristics of PL-scFv, which have wide cross-reactivity against 1,4-napththoquinone, suggest its potential use as a tool for plant immunomodulation not only for breeding Plumbaginacea family containing PL but also for breeding other medicinal plants containing bioactive naphthoquinones."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sakamoto", "ForeName": "Seiichi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taura", "ForeName": "Futoshi", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsuchihashi", "ForeName": "Ryota", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Putalun", "ForeName": "Waraporn", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kinjo", "ForeName": "Junei", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tanaka", "ForeName": "Hiroyuki", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morimoto", "ForeName": "Satoshi", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Hybridoma (Larchmt)", "NlmUniqueID": "101241539", "ISSNLinking": "1554-0014"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Primers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthoquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Single-Chain Antibodies"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YAS4TBQ4OQ", "NameOfSubstance": "plumbagin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Baculoviridae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Affinity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Cross Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Primers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Vectors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Single-Chain Antibodies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spodoptera"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21087101", "10.1089/hyb.2010.0052"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
