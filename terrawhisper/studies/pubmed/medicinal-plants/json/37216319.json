Selective inhibition of ITK might be useful for treating a variety of disorders including; autoimmune, inflammatory, and neoplastic disorders. Over the past two decades, the clinical management of ITK inhibitors has progressed dramatically. So far, specific inhibitor with no off-target effects against ITK is available. Herein, we aim to discover potential virtual hits to fasten the process of drug design and development against ITK. In this regard, the key chemical characteristics of ITK inhibitors were identified using ligand-based pharmacophore modeling. The validated pharmacophore comprises one hydrogen bond donor and three hydrogen bond acceptors and was utilized as a 3D query in virtual screening using ZINC, Covalent, and in-house databases. A total of 12 hit compounds were chosen on the basis of their critical interactions with the significant amino acids of ITK. The orbital energies such as HOMO and LUMO of the hit compounds were calculated to evaluate the inhibitor's potencies. Further, molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated the stability of ITK upon binding of selected virtual hits. Binding energy using the MMGBSA method showed the potential binding affinity of all the hits with ITK. The research identifies key chemical characteristics with geometric restrictions that lead to ITK inhibition.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
