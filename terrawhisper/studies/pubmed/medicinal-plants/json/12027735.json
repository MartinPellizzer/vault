With the benzylated amine (2b), the main product was the normal, tetraacetylated benzyl derivative of histeloside having the R configuration at the new center of chirality, C-1 (5b), with a small amount of an unidentified minor component (probably the 1S epimer 5a). In a slightly acidic medium, the reaction with histamine (2) gave two products in an approximately 6:4 ratio. The main compound proved to be the normal, tetraacetylated derivative of the lactam histelosamide with R configuration at C-1 (7b), and the minor product was the tetraacetylisohisteloside with S configuration at the same C-1 center (3a). When the reaction was carried out under acid-free conditions, in addition to the epimeric pair of the normal tetraacetylated lactam (7a, 7b) and the tetraacetylisohisteloside with 1S configuration (3a), tetraacetylneohistelosamide (8b) was also isolated, in which the cyclization took place at one of the cyclic nitrogens of the imidazole ring. Probably, this latter compound is an intermediate also in the formation of the normal isomers, but under slightly acidic conditions it rapidly isomerized into the normal alkaloid. The tendencies experienced previously in the tryptamine and dopamine series were observed also in the histamine series; that is, at C-1, the R configuration is favored over the S one, and lactamization is faster in the former than in the latter case. The structure of the products and their stereoschemistry were established by NMR spectroscopy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Organic Chemistry, Semmelweis University, H\u00f5gyes u. 7, H-1092 Budapest, Hungary."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beke", "ForeName": "Gyula", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Szab\u00f3", "ForeName": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 F", "Initials": "LF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pod\u00e1nyi", "ForeName": "Benjamin", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzene Derivatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoid Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19351-63-4", "NameOfSubstance": "secologanin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "820484N8I3", "NameOfSubstance": "Histamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Benzene Derivatives"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Caprifoliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iridoid Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iridoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12027735", "10.1021/np010415d", "np010415d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
