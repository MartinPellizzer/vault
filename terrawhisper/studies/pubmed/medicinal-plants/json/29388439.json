JJM22, an endophytic fungus isolated from the stem bark of the mangrove plant Ceriops tagal collected in South China Sea. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of detailed spectroscopic analysis. The absolute configurations of 1 and 2 were confirmed by the comparison of optical rotation and the CD data with those of known compounds. The inhibitory activities of the isolated compounds against six terrestrial pathogenic bacteria and human cervical carcinoma Hela cell line were evaluated. Compound 3 exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Ministry of Education , College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hainan Normal University , Haikou , P.
