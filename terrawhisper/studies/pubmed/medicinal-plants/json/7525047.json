The data presented here demonstrated that only three specific flavonoids--apigenin, kaempferol, and genistein--exhibited the reverting effect on the transformed phenotypes of ras-3T3 cells. For example, treatment with 25 microM of these flavonoids could effectively reverse the transformed morphology of ras-3T3 cells into flatter cells with contact inhibition. Colony formation in soft agar was decreased to 0.11%, 0.15%, and 0.35% by 25 microM apigenin, kaempferol, and genistein, respectively, as compared with control (0.92%). It was also found that the proliferation of ras-3T3 cells was significantly inhibited by these compounds in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, two biochemical parameters, the content of phosphotyrosine and cAMP, were examined to see whether affected by these compounds. The results showed the phosphotyrosine content in ras-3T3 cells was dramatically decreased by apigenin and kaempferol, but that was slightly reduced by genistein. By contrast, these three flavonoids all failed to significantly alter the level of cAMP within this transformant. Based on these observations, we suggest that some specific flavonoids are capable of reverting the transforming properties of v-H-ras transformed cells. The possible mechanism of this reversion is not mediated by activating the protein kinase A or its associated pathways, but rather inhibiting tyrosine kinases, subsequently leading to the blockage of p21ras-mediated signal transduction circuitry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Toxicology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, R.O.C."}], "LastName": "Kuo", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "J K", "Initials": "JK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "T S", "Initials": "TS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "N C", "Initials": "NC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7600053", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3835"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoflavones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Kaempferols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "21820-51-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphotyrosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42HK56048U", "NameOfSubstance": "Tyrosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "731P2LE49E", "NameOfSubstance": "kaempferol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DH2M523P0H", "NameOfSubstance": "Genistein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E0399OZS9N", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclic AMP"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.10.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases"}], "GeneSymbolList": ["ras"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "3T3 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Transformed"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Transformation, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chamomile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclic AMP"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, ras"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genistein"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Isoflavones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kaempferols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphotyrosine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tyrosine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7525047", "10.1016/0304-3835(94)90414-6", "0304-3835(94)90414-6"]}}]}
