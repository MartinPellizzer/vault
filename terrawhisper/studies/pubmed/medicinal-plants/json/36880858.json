It is widely cultivated in China. According to our survey, about 60% of A. carmichaelii in Qingchuan, Sichuan, suffered from root rot, reducing yields by 30% in the past five years. Symptomatic plants exhibited stunted growth, dark brown roots, reduced root biomass, and fewer root hairs. The disease caused root rot and plant death in 50% of the infected plants. In October 2019, ten symptomatic 6-month-old plants were collected from fields in Qingchuan. Diseased pieces of the roots were surface sterilized with sodium hypochlorite solution (2%), rinsed three times in sterile water, plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at 25\u00b0C in the dark. Six single-spore isolates of a Cylindrocarpon-like anamorp were obtained. The colonies on PDA were 35 to 37 mm diam after seven days with regular margins. The plates were covered with felty aerial mycelium, white to buff, and the reverse side chestnut near center with a ochre to yellowish leading edge. On spezieller n\u00e4hrstoffarmer agar (SNA), macroconidia were 1 to 3 septate, straight or slightly curved, cylindrical, with rounded ends, and varied in size: 1-septate 15.1 to 33.5 \u00d7 3.7 to 7.3 \u03bcm (n=250), 2-septate 16.5 to 48.5 \u00d7 3.7 to 7.6 \u03bcm (n=85), and 3-septate 22.0 to 50.6 \u00d7 4.9 to 7.4 \u03bcm (n=115). Microconidia were ellipsoid to ovoid, and 0 to 1 septate; aseptate spores were 4.5 to 16.8 \u00d7 1.6 to 4.9 \u03bcm (n=200), and 1-septate spores were 7.4 to 20.0 \u00d7 2.4 to 5.1 \u03bcm (n=200). The chlamydospores were brown, thick-walled, globose to subglobose, 7.9 to 15.9 \u03bcm (n=50). The morphology of these isolates was consistent with the previous description of Ilyonectria robusta (Cabral et al. 2012). Isolate QW1901 was characterized by sequencing the ITS, TUB, H3, and tef1\u03b1 loci using previously reported primer pairs: ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), T1/Bt-2b (O'Donnell and Cigelnik 1997), CYLH3F/CYLH3R (Crous et al. 2004), and EF1/EF2 (O'Donnell et al. 1998). A Blastn search of the sequences of ITS, TUB, H3, and tef1\u03b1 showed that QW1901 shared 99.26, 97.89, 97.79, and 99.17 % identities, respectively, with the ex-type strain of I. robusta (CBS308.35). The ITS, TUB, H3, and tef1\u03b1 sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession nos. MW534715, and MW880180 to MW880182, respectively. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from a neighbor-joining analysis on the alignment of the combined ITS, TUB, H3, and tef1\u03b1 sequence. QW1901 was clustered with the ex-type strain of I. robusta. To confirm the pathogenicity of I. robusta, bare roots of healthy 6-month-old A. carmichaelii were inoculated with mycelial plugs of 7-day-old QW1901 colonies selected randomly (Lu et al. 2015). Five needle-wound lateral roots and five intact roots were inoculated as replicates with pathogen-free agar plugs as a control. Then, all plants were grown in sterile soil in a growth chamber at 20\u00b11\u00b0C and watered regularly. Pathogenicity assays were repeated twice. After 20 days of cultivation, infected plants exhibited symptoms similar to those observed in the field. All control plants remained asymptomatic. Sequencing confirmed the re-isolation of I. robusta from the inoculated plants, satisfying Koch's hypothesis. Ilyonectria robusta has been reported to cause root rot of plants such as Codonopsis tangshen and Panax ginseng ( Lu et al. 2015; Zheng et al. 2021), and has also been reported to be isolated from Aconitum kongboense in China (Wang et al. 2015). However, this is the first report of the pathogen causing root rot of A. carmichaelii. Management measures, such as growing disease-free seedlings in sterile soil, should be used to minimize the risk of this pathogen."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine Sciences, Sichuan Provincial Key Laboratory of Quality and Innovation Research of Chinese Materia Medica, SiChuan, China; 861322336@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hongsu", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cheng Du University, Chengdu, China; 542458715@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yanxi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University, 12529, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China, 610041; 594787716@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine Sciences, Sichuan Provincial Key Laboratory of Quality and Innovation Research of Chinese Materia Medica, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 158576144@qq.com."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Weijing", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine Sciences, Sichuan Provincial Key Laboratory of Quality and Innovation Research of Chinese Materia Medica, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 416634832@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine Sciences, Sichuan Provincial Key Laboratory of Quality and Innovation Research of Chinese Materia Medica, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 155181427@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yuxia", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine Sciences, Sichuan Provincial Key Laboratory of Quality and Innovation Research of Chinese Materia Medica, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 1040280421@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Songlin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine Sciences, Sichuan Provincial Key Laboratory of Quality and Innovation Research of Chinese Materia Medica, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 329972176@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Development Service Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 617751077@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine Sciences, Sichuan Provincial Key Laboratory of Quality and Innovation Research of Chinese Materia Medica, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 291401676@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Qingmao", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine Sciences, Sichuan Provincial Key Laboratory of Quality and Innovation Research of Chinese Materia Medica, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 28360073@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cheng Du University, 74707, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; xiayanli@cdu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Yanli", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36880858", "10.1094/PDIS-08-22-1799-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
