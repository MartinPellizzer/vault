It composed of fructose and glucose residues. The molar ratio was 8.7:1.0. It was a water-soluble neutral polysaccharide of white powder in purity of 99.9%. The effect of ABPS 0.625 x 10(2)-2.00 x 10(3) mg.L-1 on lymphocyte proliferation to Con A on splenocytes from aged mice was evaluated to be about 1.11-3.26 folds in vitro. ABPS 1.00 x 10(3) mg.L-1 was shown to increase IL-2 production in Con A-stimulated aged mouse splenocytes from 6.7 +/- 1.0 u.ml-1 to 19.3 +/- 5.7 u.ml-1 in vitro. Sandwish-ELISA was used for the determination of TNF-alpha, TNF-beta and sIL-2R in cell suspension. The spectrophotometry with Griess reagent was used for the determination of NO in cell suspension. A method was developed for the determination of NOS activity in biological sample by HPLC. ABPS 50, 100 mg.kg-1 i.p. was found to markedly promote TNF-beta and NO release, but decrease sIL-2R production from Con A-stimulated aged rat splenocytes, the activity of NOS in those cells was increased. ABPS 100 mg.kg-1 i.p. elevated serum TNF-alpha and NO contents and the NOS activity induced by LPS 0.3 mg.kg-1 i.p. in aged rats. ABPS 50-800 mg.L-1 elevated TNF-alpha and NO production from PM phi and increased the NOS activity in PM phi in vitro, but showed no significant influence on TNF-alpha, NO release and on NOS activity induced by LPS 10 mg.L-1 for PM phi from aged rats. ABPS 100 mg.kg-1 i.p. elicited TNF-alpha, NO production and NOS activity for PM phi from aged rats, ABPS 100 mg.kg-1 i.p. showed a synergetic action with LPS 10 mg.L-1. When rats were treated with ABPS 50-800 mg.L-1 i.p., there was no significant difference on NO production on, and NOS activity in the cerebral cortex between those isolated from aged rats and those isolated from young rats. These results indicate that ABPS may prime and trigger M phi and has restorative effects on the deficiency of the immune system associated with aging in mice and rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Z K", "Initials": "ZK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "D D", "Initials": "DD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nos1 protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nos1 protein, rat"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11596182"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
