Lignans, the secondary metabolites in plants with high bioactivity, are widely distributed in a variety of plant species, and their antiviral, antitumor, antibacterial, and antioxidant activities have been proved in clinical practice. Generally, lignans are diverse in structures with many chiral centers, and most of them are optically active. The biosynthesis of lignans depends on the oxidative coupling reaction through site selection and stereo selection, which impedes synthesized lignans to form racemates, but makes them in a three-dimensional configuration. Dirigent protein(DIR) plays an important role in guiding location selection and stereo selection of lignans in biosynthesis. In vitro studies on lignan biosynthesis have shown that racemic end products are obtained in the absence of DIR proteins, while the products in a three-dimensional configuration can be yielded in the presence of DIR proteins, indicating that DIR proteins play an asymmetric role in the biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites. The present study reviewed the biolo-gical significance of DIR protein, the cloning of DIR gene, gene structure, catalytic mechanism, and the research progress in Isatis indigotica, Eucommia ulmoides, Forsythia suspensa, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Panax pseudoginseng var. notoginseng, and Schisandra chinensis, which provides a reference for the follow-up research of DIR gene."]}, "AuthorList":
