When the enzyme was activated by sodium dodecyl sulfate, the lag period completely disappeared. This transition was reversible, since a burst was observed when the enzyme was preincubated at acid pH, before being returned to its previous experimental conditions. The pK for the isomerization process (pK(H) = 4.6) was estimated by preincubating the enzyme at different pH values and analyzing the product accumulation curves. Negative kinetic cooperativity was evident over a pH range in which the isomerization reaction was significant when the steady state was measured as a function of different substrate concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Bioqu\u00edmica y Biolog\u00eda Molecular A, Facultad de Biolog\u00eda, Universidad de Murcia, Campus de Espinardo, Spain."}], "LastName": "Jim\u00e9nez", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda-Carmona", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "368GB5141J", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.10.3.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechol Oxidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catechol Oxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8660678", "10.1006/abbi.1996.0277", "S0003986196902775"]}}]}
