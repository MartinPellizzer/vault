Seventeen compounds which were 3 terpenoids, 8 lipid compounds, 3 alcohol compounds and 3 ketones were separated by preparative GC after dividing the essential oil into 5 groups of fractions by silica gel column. The chemical structures of isolated compounds were identified by GC-QTOF-MS and NMR. Three new in general compounds (50, 53 and 55) were isolated. And proton and carbon spectra of six compounds were provided for the first time. Through separation and structure identification of the compounds, qualitative analysis of total chemical components of the essential oil was increased from 42.0% to 90.3%. This research would be of great significance to application of <i>Ruta graveolens</i> L. essential oil."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Guangyao", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Xi", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China."}], "LastName": "Aimila", "ForeName": "Aoken", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Xiaohui", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China."}], "LastName": "Maiwulanjiang", "ForeName": "Maitinuer", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4652-6879"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China."}], "LastName": "Aisa", "ForeName": "H A", "Initials": "HA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ruta"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32336143", "10.1080/14786419.2020.1756798"]}}]}
