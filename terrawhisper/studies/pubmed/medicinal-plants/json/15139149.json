Isolated mononuclear leucocytes from human peripheral blood (PBMC) were incubated (1 x 10(6).mL-1) with or without sinomenine (or indomethacin), after incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C with 5% CO2; the media were assayed for the PGE2 by radioimmunoassay (RIA). LPS was used to stimulate the monocytes at a concentration of 5 micrograms.mL-1. And by RT-PCR, both COX-1 and COX-2 mRNAs were detected in Mononuclear leukocytes after incubation for different hours with drug (sinomenine or indomethacin) or not.", "LPS (stimulated) induced the production of PGE2 in PBMC increasing with high expression of COX-2 mRNA; sinomenine reduced PGE2 production in LPS stimulated human monocytes more than in non-stimulated human monocytes. In comparative experiments, indomethacin, a non selective COX inhibitor, reduced the production of PGE2 equally in both states. Meanwhile, neither sinomenine(0.1-1 mmol.L-1) nor indomethacin(0.5-10 mumol.L-1) inhibited the expression of both COX-1 and COX-2 mRNAs by RT-PCR with beta-actin as reference.", "In contrast with indomethacin, Sinomenine shows a preferential inhibitory effect on COX-2 over COX-1, These results suggest that Sinomenine is a selective COX-2 inhibitor, which may be directly related to suppressing cyclooxygenase activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immunology, Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510405, Guangdong, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wen-jun", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Pei-xun", "Initials": "PX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao-juan", "Initials": "XJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membrane Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Morphinans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "63LT81K70N", "NameOfSubstance": "sinomenine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "PTGS1 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "PTGS2 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K7Q1JQR04M", "NameOfSubstance": "Dinoprostone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Dinoprostone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes, Mononuclear"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Morphinans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sinomenium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15139149"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
