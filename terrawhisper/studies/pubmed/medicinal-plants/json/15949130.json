These results suggest that the antioxidant properties are mostly attributed to the presence of allicin in the garlic extract. Allicin a major component of the thiosulfinates in garlic extract, was found to be effective for inhibiting methyl linoleate oxidation, but its efficiency was less than that of alpha-tocopherol. Next, the reactivity of allicin toward the peroxyl radical, which is a chain-propagating species, was investigated by direct ESR detection. The addition allicin to 2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile)-peroxyl radical solution caused the signal intensity of the peroxyl radical to dose-dependently decrease, indicating that allicin is capable of scavenging the the peroxyl radical and acting as an antioxidant. Finally, we studied the structure-anioxidant activity relationship for thiosulfinates and suggested that the combination of the allyl group (-CH2CH=CH2) and the -S(O)S- group is necessary for the antioxidant action of thiosulfinates in the garlic extract. In addition, one of the two possible combinations, -S(O)S-CH2CH=CH2, was found to make a much larger contribution to the antioxidant activity of the thiosulfinates than the other, CH2=CH-CH2-S(O)S-."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departments of Analytical Chemistry, School of Health Sciences, Kyorin University, Tokyo, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okada", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tanaka", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fujita", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sato", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okajima", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Redox Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "9511366", "ISSNLinking": "1351-0002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetonitriles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Linoleic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfinic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiosulfates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "24N6726DE5", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl linoleate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3C39BY17Y6", "NameOfSubstance": "allicin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z072SB282N", "NameOfSubstance": "acetonitrile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetonitriles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disulfides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Linoleic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfinic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Thiosulfates"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15949130", "10.1179/135100005X38851"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
