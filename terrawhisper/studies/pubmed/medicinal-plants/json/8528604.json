Sequence comparison of the rose DFR with reported DFR genes revealed that they are homologous to each other. The amount of DFR mRNA in rose petals was developmentally regulated and paralleled anthocyanin production in petals. Sepals, thorns, styles and stamens also contained anthocyanins and DFR mRNA. No DFR mRNA was observed in mature leaves and a small amount of the transcript was detected in young leaves. A petunia cultivar, whose colour was pale pink due to a deficiency in flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase and flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase, was transformed with a binary vector containing a rose DFR cDNA cloned behind a constitutive promoter. Petals and anthers of the resultant transgenic petunia plants were salmon pink and contained pelargonidin, an anthocyanidin rarely found in petunia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Fundamental Research, Suntory Ltd., Osaka, Japan."}], "LastName": "Tanaka", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fukui", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fukuchi-Mizutani", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Holton", "ForeName": "T A", "Initials": "TA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Higgins", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kusumi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["D85102"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9430925", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0781"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Alcohol Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "dihydroflavanol 4-reductase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8528604", "10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a078844"]}}]}
