There are 200 species of pteridophyta and 2802 spermatophyta.", "Investigation of wild medicine species has been proceeded, as well as introduction and research of their propagation techniques and production. Guizhou is rich in medicinal plant resources. However, their species and population are reducing progressively. Effective measures must be taken to protect the germ plasma resources and put them into rational uses for the utilization and sustainable development. Rare and endemic medicine species must be introduced for conservation, propagation and realization of GAP pilot cultivation. Resources must be used in an economical way and products must be made with a high technological content."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Botanical Garden, Guiyang 550004, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "T C", "Initials": "TC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecology"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12528502"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
