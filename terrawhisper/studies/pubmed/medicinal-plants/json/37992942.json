Werner (WRN) DNA helicase, an important member of the RecQ family of helicases, plays an important role in DNA repair and telomere stability maintenance. WRN gene dysfunction leads to premature aging and predisposes humans to various types of cancers. However, the biological function of WRN in cancer remains unknown. In this study, the expression of this RecQ family helicase was investigated in different types of leukemia cells, and the leukemia cell line K562 with high WRN expression was selected to construct a WRN knockdown cell line. The results showed that WRN knockdown inhibited leukemia occurrence and development by regulating the proliferation, cell cycle, differentiation, and aging of cells and other biological processes. The results of transcriptome sequencing revealed that WRN promoted the sensitivity of leukemia cells to the DNA damage inducer Etoposide by regulating cell cycle-related proteins, such as CDC2, cyclin B1, p16, and p21, as well as key proteins in DNA damage repair pathways, such as p53, RAD50, RAD51, and MER11. Our findings show that WRN helicase is a promising potential target for leukemia treatment, providing new ideas for the development of targeted drugs against leukemia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
