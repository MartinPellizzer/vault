The hyoscyamine 6\u03b2-hydroxylase genes of Hyoscyamus niger (HnH6H) and S.\u00a0lurida (SlH6H) were cloned and respectively overexpressed in hairy root cultures of S.\u00a0lurida, to compare their effects on promoting the production of TAs, especially the high-value scopolamine. Root cultures with SlH6H/HnH6H overexpression were confirmed by PCR and real-time quantitative PCR, suggesting that the enzymatic steps defined by H6H were strongly elevated at the transcriptional level. Tropane alkaloids, including hyoscyamine, anisodamine and scopolamine, were analyzed by HPLC. Scopolamine and anisodamine contents were remarkably elevated in the root cultures overexpressing SlH6H/HnH6H, whereas that of hyoscyamine was more or less reduced, when compared with those of the control. These results also indicated that SlH6H and HnH6H promoted anisodamine production at similar levels in S.\u00a0lurida root cultures. More importantly, HnH6H-overexpressing root cultures had more scopolamine in them that did SlH6H-overexpressing root cultures. This study not only provides a feasible way of overexpressing H6H to produce high-value scopolamine in engineered root cultures of S.\u00a0lurida but also found that HnH6H was better than SlH6H for engineering scopolamine production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
