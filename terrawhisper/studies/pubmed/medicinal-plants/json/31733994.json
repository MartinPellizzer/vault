These PMs are associated with potentially hazardous elements (PHEs) such as organic compounds (e.g. Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons) that can be harmful to health. The main objective of this work is the identification and investigation of the toxicological aspects of PHEs in PMs during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season in an urban area of Northeast region (NER) of India. In the course of the study, the 24\u202f-hs average concentrations of PMs were detected to be more than two-times higher than the Indian standard limit (NAAQ, category) which indicates poor air quality in both the seasons around the sampling sites. This study demonstrates that the concentrations of PM-bound PAHs are mutagenic and that the Excess Cancer Risks exceed the USEPA standard limits. PMs cause cytotoxicity and can also induce genotoxicity to human health analyzed by cell culture and gel electrophoresis. This study helps to promote research to evaluate the PMs bound PHEs toxicity in diverse human cell lines and also their relationship with climatic factors as well as quantitative source apportionment for mitigation purposes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
