Compounds 5-19 showed high activity towards A549\u00a0cell line with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.12-8.70\u00a0\u03bcM. Compounds 6, 12 and 18 were the most potent in this series. These compounds were further screened as dual inhibitors for EGFR/HER2 enzymes in comparison with erlotinib and were found to possess very potent activity. Compound 12 showed the highest activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.06\u00a0\u03bcM and 0.30\u00a0\u03bcM towards EGFR and HER2, respectively. Accordingly, the apoptotic effect of the most potent compounds 6, 12 and 18 was investigated and showed a marked increase in the level of caspases-3 by 6, 9 and 8 folds, respectively, compared to the control cells. Moreover, Molecular modeling was performed inside the active site of EGFR, keeping in mind their binding possibilities, bond lengths, angles and energy scores. It was found that the most active compounds demonstrated the best binding scores in the active site of EGFR, which may clarify their high inhibition profile."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.
