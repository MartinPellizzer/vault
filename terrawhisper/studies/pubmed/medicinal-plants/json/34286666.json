Within the current study, Hsp90 inhibitors that entered different phases of clinical trials were subjected to Zinc15 structure query to find similar compounds (\u2265 78%). Obtained small molecules (<b>1</b>-<b>29</b>) with defined similarity cut-off were docked into ensemble of Hsp90-\u03b1 NTDs. Docked complexes were ranked on the basis of binding modes and Gibbs free energies as Hsp90 binders (cut-off point; \u0394G<sub>b</sub> \u2264 -12\u2009kcal/mol). Top-ranked compounds were subjected to energy decomposition analysis per residue of binding pocket via density functional theory (DFT) calculations in B3LYP level of theory. Subsequent MD simulations of the top-ranked complexes were performed for 100\u2009ns to explore the stable binding modes during a reasonable period in explicit water. Results of molecular docking and intermolecular binding analysis indicated that H-bond, hydrophobic and salt bridge interactions were determinant forces in complex formation. Compounds <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> were well accommodated in binding pocket of Hsp90 via relatively varied conformations. It was revealed that Asn51 and Phe138 were key residues that interacted stably to <b>19</b> and <b>20</b>. Although primary mechanism of action for proposed molecules are unknown and yet to be explored, results of the present study revealed key structural features for future structure-guided optimization toward potent inhibitors of Hsp90-\u03b1 NTD. HighlightsHsp90 inhibitors that entered different phases of clinical trials were subjected to Zinc15 based structure query to afford potential enzyme inhibitors <b>19</b> and <b>20</b>.Quantum chemical calculations confirmed docking results and verified pivotal role of a conserved residues (Asn51, Leu103, Phe138 and Tyr139) in making effective hydrogen bonds.MD simulations of top-ranked docked derivatives revealed the achievement of stable binding modes with less conformational variation of <b>20</b> than <b>19</b> in the active site of Hsp90-\u03b1 NTD.H-bond, hydrophobic contacts and salt bridge interactions were determinant forces in binding interactions of <i>in silico</i> hits.Resorcinol and isoxazole were important structural motifs of <i>in silico</i> hits in binding to the active site of Hsp90-\u03b1 NTD.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
