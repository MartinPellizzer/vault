When sperm were incubated with 10 and 100 mcg of gossypol acetic acid for different time periods at 37 degrees centigrade, a marked reduction in motility was abserved. The motility was reduced from 83-4% after 210 minutes (P .001). Also, a significant decrease in the activities of calcium ion and magnesium ion activated ATPase in the sperm was observed after incubation in gossypol (P .005). Zinc ion concentration also showed a change, but it was not statistically significant. These data indicate that sperm motility inhibition after gossypol treatment is due to inhibition of ATPase activity in the sperm. This research was conducted in India."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["001617", "00086656"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: ANDROLOGIA."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Biology", "Contraception", "Contraceptive Agents", "Contraceptive Mode Of Action", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Economic Factors", "Enzymes And Enzyme Inhibitors", "Enzymes--analysis", "Family Planning", "Health", "Health Services", "India", "Inhibition Of Fertilization", "Medicine", "Oral Contraceptives", "Physiology", "Plants, Medicinal--pharmacodynamics", "Research And Development", "Sperm Immobilizing Agents", "Sperm Transport Inhibition", "Spermicidal Contraceptive Agents", "Technology"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "6454365", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1981", "Month": "08", "Day": "10"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "09", "Day": "13"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0303-4569", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "13", "Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1981", "Season": "Mar-Apr"}}, "Title": "Andrologia", "ISOAbbreviation": "Andrologia"}, "ArticleTitle": "Studies on the male antifertility agent-gossypol acetic acid.
