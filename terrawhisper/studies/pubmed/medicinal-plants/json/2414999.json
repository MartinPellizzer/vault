The major controversy concerns the question of whether the inhibition of the Na+-K+ pump by digitalis, particularly at low (therapeutic) concentrations, increases the intracellular Na+ concentration and thus is causally related to the positive inotropic effect. Na+-selective microelectrodes, introduced recently, have made it possible to measure small changes in intracellular Na+ activity (aiNa) in beating preparations of cardiac muscle and, in particular, to follow the exact time course of change in both aiNa and contractile force during the positive inotropic effect of digitalis. It has been demonstrated that digitalis at low and high concentrations produces a parallel increase in aiNa and in contractile force during the onset of its effect; washout of the drug results in a parallel and complete recovery of aiNa and contractile force. Additional strong evidence for a correlation between the pump inhibition and digitalis inotropy is the fact that the magnitude of increase in aiNa and contractile force produced by digitalis depends on the level of aiNa and therefore on the rate of Na+ extrusion by the Na+-K+ pump. The study on the quantitative relationship between aiNa and contractile force reveals that the force of contraction is a power function of aiNa, such that a small rise in aiNa produces a significant increase in contractile force. Direct measurements of aiNa and intracellular free Ca2+ during digitalis inotropy strongly support the hypothesis that an increase in aiNa raises intracellular Ca2+ via Na+-Ca2+ exchange, thus producing the positive inotropic effect. In conclusion, the recent data available from the simultaneous and continuous measurements of aiNa and contractile force strongly indicate that the inhibition of the Na+-K+ pump is causally related to the positive inotropic effect of digitalis on cardiac muscle."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "C O", "Initials": "CO"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-21136", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0370511", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ion Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9NEZ333N27", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RWP5GA015D", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Heart"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 18th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ion Channels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium"}], "NumberOfReferences": "93"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2414999", "10.1152/ajpcell.1985.249.5.C367"]}}]}
