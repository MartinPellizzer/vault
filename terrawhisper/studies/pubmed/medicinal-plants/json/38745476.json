Chrysanthemum morifolium, used in tea products, has ornamental and medicinal value. However, it is susceptible to Alternaria alternata fungal infection, posing a threat to its production and use, resulting in substantial economic losses. Increasing the density of glandular trichomes enhances disease resistance and improves the production of medicinal metabolites in chrysanthemums. Jasmonate (JA), promotes the formation of glandular trichomes in various plants. However, it remains unclear whether glandular trichome in chrysanthemums are regulated by JA. Grafting, a technique to improve plant resistance to biotic stresses, has been insufficiently explored in its impact on glandular trichomes, terpenoids, and disease resistance. In this study, we demonstrated that grafting with Artemisia vulgaris rootstocks improves the resistance of chrysanthemum scions to A. alternata. Heterografted chrysanthemums exhibited higher trichome density and terpenoid content compared to self-grafted counterparts. Transcriptome analysis highlighted the significant role of CmJAZ1-like in disease resistance in heterografted chrysanthemums. Overexpressing CmJAZ1-like lines exhibited sensitivity to A. alternate, characterized by reduced glandular trichome density and limited terpenoids. Conversely, silencing lines exhibited resistance to A. alternata showcasing increased glandular trichome density and abundant terpenoids. Higher JA content was confirmed in heterografted chrysanthemum scions compared to self-grafted ones. Furthermore, we established that JA promotes the development of glandular trichomes and the synthesis of terpenoids while inducing the degradation of CmJAZ1-like proteins in chrysanthemums. These findings suggest that higher JA increases trichome density and terpenoid content, enhancing resistance to A. alternata by regulating CmJAZ1-like in heterografted chrysanthemums."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
