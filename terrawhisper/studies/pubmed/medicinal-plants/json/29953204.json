First, features of the screening system were investigated in four aspects: (1) specificity of the STAT3-immobilized chip, it shows that the chip could be applied to screen STAT3 ligands from complex mixture; (2) linearity and limit of detection (LOD) of the system, the minimum recovery cycle number was determined as 5 cycles; (3) saturability of the chip, the results indicate that it is necessary to select a proper concentration based on the compound's K<sub>d</sub> value; (4) robustness of the system, it indicates that inactive compounds in the matrix could not interfere with active compounds in the process of screening. Next, SPR-AIRS was applied to screen STAT3 ligands from medicinal herbs. Nine candidate compounds were fished out. Then SPR assay and molecular docking were performed to verify the interplay between STAT3 and candidate compounds. Apoptosis assay and luciferase report assay were performed to investigate the drug effect of candidate compounds on STAT3 activity. Western blot results indicated that neobaicalein and polydatin could inhibit the phosphorylation of STAT3. As far as we know, this is the first time that neobaicalein and polydatin are reported as effective STAT3 ligands. In a conclusion, we have systemically demonstrated the feasibility of SPR biosensor-based screening method applying to complex drug systems, and our findings suggest that SPR-AIRS could be a sensitive and effective solution for the discovery of active compounds from a complex matrix."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy , Second Military Medical University , Shanghai 200433 , PR China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Langdong", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy , Second Military Medical University , Shanghai 200433 , PR China."}], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Diya", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy , Second Military Medical University , Shanghai 200433 , PR China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xiaofei", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changhai Hospital , Second Military Medical University , Shanghai 200433 , PR China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Mingdong", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy , Second Military Medical University , Shanghai 200433 , PR China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dongyao", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy , Second Military Medical University , Shanghai 200433 , PR China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy , Second Military Medical University , Shanghai 200433 , PR China."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Zhanying", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy , Second Military Medical University , Shanghai 200433 , PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Zhenyu", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changhai Hospital , Second Military Medical University , Shanghai 200433 , PR China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Xiaoxia", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5510-9773"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy , Second Military Medical University , Shanghai 200433 , PR China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changhai Hospital , Second Military Medical University , Shanghai 200433 , PR China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jianmin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy , Second Military Medical University , Shanghai 200433 , PR China."}], "LastName": "Chai", "ForeName": "Yifeng", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immobilized Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ligands"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "STAT3 Transcription Factor"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hep G2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Immobilized Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ligands"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "MCF-7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "STAT3 Transcription Factor"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Surface Plasmon Resonance"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29953204", "10.1021/acs.analchem.8b01103"]}}]}
