Lack of effective treatment contributed to its continued occurrence, and hence, search for an effective treatment should be considered a priority area to minimize its impacts. Previous ethnobotanical studies have reported that Curcuma longa, Phytolacca dodecandra, and Datura stramonium were used to treat cutaneous fungal infections and reduce their incidence. The treatment effects of these plants against epizootic lymphangitis should be studied. The in\u00a0vitro growth inhibitory effects of methanol extracts of the root of C.\u00a0longa, berry of P.\u00a0dodecandra, and leaf of D.\u00a0stramonium were evaluated. Histoplasma capsulatum var farciminosum was isolated from clinical cases of epizootic lymphangitis in carthorses in central Ethiopia. The nested polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm the identity of the isolates. Serial twofold dilutions of the extract of berries of P.\u00a0dodecandra and leaves of D.\u00a0stramonium were done in sterile water, whereas dilution of the extract of roots of C.\u00a0longa was done in dimethylsulphoxide. The effects of the plants on the growth of Histoplasma capsulatum var farciminosum were assessed by agar dilution assay. Culture media with no antifungal agent and media containing ketoconazole served as negative and positive control, respectively. The methanol extract of C.\u00a0longa showed inhibitory effects at concentrations ranging from 0.07 to 5\u00a0mg/mL. Similarly, the methanol extract of P.\u00a0dodecandra showed growth inhibitory effects at concentrations ranging from 0.156 to 5\u00a0mg/mL. That is, the growth inhibitory concentration of C.\u00a0longa was 0.07\u00a0mg/mL, whereas that of P.\u00a0dodecandra was 0.156\u00a0mg/mL. In contrast, D.\u00a0stramonium showed no inhibitory effect. This preliminary observation showed that methanol extracts of C.\u00a0longa and P.\u00a0dodecandra showed inhibitory effects on the growth of Histoplasma capsulatum var farciminosum requiring further repeated in\u00a0vitro evaluation so as to generate adequate evidence, which would justify in\u00a0vivo trials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
