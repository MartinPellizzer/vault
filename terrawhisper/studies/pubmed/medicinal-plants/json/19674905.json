Compound 1 exhibited potent antiproliferative effect against several human tumor cell lines, but its effect against some human normal cell lines was much lower than that of mitomycin. On the other hand, its enantiomer (R)-1 was less active toward the above tumor cell lines than 1. The antiproliferative effect of 2 against all tumor cell lines was significantly reduced. These results indicated the presence of the phenolic hydroxy group at C-5 is of great important for increasing antiproliferative effect. In addition, 1 also showed higher cancer chemopreventive activity than 2, while there were no significant differences between 1 and 2 in antimicrobial activity. Both compounds displayed modest antifungal and antibacterial activity (gram-positive bacteria), whereas they were inactive against gram-negative bacteria."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Takasaki University of Health and Welfare, Nakaorui-machi, Takasaki 370-0033, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamashita", "ForeName": "Mitsuaki", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaneko", "ForeName": "Masafumi", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tokuda", "ForeName": "Harukuni", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishimura", "ForeName": "Katsumi", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumeda", "ForeName": "Yuko", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iida", "ForeName": "Akira", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Bioorg Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9413298", "ISSNLinking": "0968-0896"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthoquinones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tabebuia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19674905", "10.1016/j.bmc.2009.07.039", "S0968-0896(09)00698-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
