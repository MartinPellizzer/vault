(Apiaceae) have been shown some biological potential for preventing and treating diseases. Fractions and isolated compounds were tested on colon carcinoma (HT-29), cervical carcinoma (HeLa), breast carcinoma (MCF-7), and mouse embryonic fibroblast (NIH/3T3) cell lines. The BSLT method was used for the assessment of the general toxicity of the petroleum ether (PET), chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and methanol (MeOH) fractions obtained from the aerial parts of <i>L. avicennae.</i> 1H-NMR and 13\u2009C-NMR spectroscopy were used for structure elucidation. Five compounds, including two coumarins, osthole and umbelliferone, a diterpene phytol, \u03b2-sitosterol, and lauric acid, were isolated for the first time from <i>L. avicennae.</i> Osthole showed potent cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 and HT-29 cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 4.23\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 and 12.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13\u2009\u00b5g/mL, respectively. Phytol demonstrated potent cytotoxic activity towards MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 6.80\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08 and 12.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.18\u2009\u00b5g/mL, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sabernavaei", "ForeName": "Mahsa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Montazeri", "ForeName": "Hamed", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacoeconomics, School of Pharmacy, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirzabeigi", "ForeName": "Parastoo", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sharafi-Badr", "ForeName": "Paria", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zamani", "ForeName": "Mozhdeh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hadjiakhoondi", "ForeName": "Abbas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yassaa", "ForeName": "Narguess", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kobarfard", "ForeName": "Farzad", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37888845", "10.1080/14786419.2023.2275286"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
