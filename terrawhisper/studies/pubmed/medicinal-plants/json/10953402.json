Significant differences were found in males from these groups with regards to habits and oral cancer awareness. Muslim males use tobacco and paan more than the other groups but avoid alcohol. Sikh males drink more alcohol (especially spirits) than the other groups but their use of tobacco and paan is low. Habits of Hindu and Jain males are variable. However, approximately 10% of both 1st and 2nd generation Hindu males combine all three habits of alcohol, tobacco and paan; and are thus considered to be at high risk of developing oral cancer. Seven percent of 1st generation Hindu males were found to chew paans containing tobacco which are strongly associated with oral cancer. More 2nd generation Jains drank alcohol than the 1st generation, and a greater proportion of Hindu, Sikh and Jain 2nd generation males drink spirits than their older counterparts. Knowledge of oral cancer risk factors and preventive measures were variable, the lowest level of knowledge being among the 1st generation Sikh group. Few volunteers realised the risk of alcohol drinking in the aetiology of oral cancer.", "The 'Asian' community in Leicester is not homogeneous, but consists of distinct community groups; each with their own cultural beliefs, habits and attitudes. Knowledge of these differences can be used to provide appropriate health education programmes suitably targeted to reduce the use of the known risk factors for oral cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Clinical Dentistry, University of Sheffield."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vora", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yeoman", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hayter", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br Dent J", "NlmUniqueID": "7513219", "ISSNLinking": "0007-0610"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "ethnology", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Bangladesh"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chi-Square Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cohort Effect"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "England"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnicity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Religion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Sri Lanka"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "ethnology", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Substance-Related Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "ethnology", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco Use Disorder"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10953402", "10.1038/sj.bdj.4800506"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
