The virus's main protease enzyme, SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, is essential for its replication and transcription processes. Targeting this enzyme presents a promising avenue for antiviral drug development. Researchers have explored the intricate three-dimensional configurations of the enzyme, analyzing its interactions with various inhibitors. These findings provide a foundation for designing specific and powerful inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Certain plants possess medicinal attributes due to the presence of bioactive compounds that inhibit pathogens. The olive tree (<i>Olea europaea</i>) has served as a source of food and medicine, containing bioactive compounds in its leaves that hinder the proliferation of various pathogens including viruses. This study explores the potential of bioactive compounds from olive leaf extract (OLE) to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. <i>In-silico</i> study was conducted to predict the pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles of these compounds. Molecular docking was utilized to assess their binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and their potential interference with its function. The top three compounds, apigenin (Api), luteolin-7-O-glucoside (Lut) and rutin (Rut), were chosen based on their favorable drug-like properties and strong binding affinities to Mpro. Detailed molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in conjunction with these compounds, showing minimal structural alterations over the simulation period. Particularly, Lut and Rut formed bonds with critical amino acid residues His41 and Cys145 of Mpro, suggesting their potential inhibitory effect. These findings suggest that these compounds hold promise as natural drug candidates for combating COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
