Genomic clones carrying the single SrEnod2locus were isolated and the DNA sequence of the gene was determined. The SrEnod2 gene was found to lack introns and to encode a protein consisting primarily of a 55-fold repeat of short proline-rich oligopeptides. A putative signal sequence, which may be responsible for targeting of the Enod2 protein to the cell wall, was found to precede this repeat. The temporal expression of the SrEnod2 gene was found to be different in S. rostrata stem versus root nodules induced by Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571. SrEnod2 gene expression was shown to be induced specifically and rapidly by physiologically significant concentrations of exogenously supplied cytokinins. The SrEnod2 gene was also found to be highly expressed in S. rostrata crown gall tumors induced by wild-type Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains, but not in tumors induced by an A. tumefaciens strain carrying a mutation in the cytokinin biosynthesis gene 4. Implications of these observations with regard to cytokinin-induced plant gene expression and a possible role for cytokinin as a symbiotic signal are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Z\u00fcchtungsforschung, Abteilung Genetische Grundlagen der Pflanzenz\u00fcchtung, K\u00f6ln, Germany."}], "LastName": "Dehio", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "de Bruijn", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["X63339"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant J", "NlmUniqueID": "9207397", "ISSNLinking": "0960-7412"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "GeneSymbolList": ["SrEnod2"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokinins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Development"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1303791", "10.1046/j.1365-313x.1992.t01-51-00999.x"]}}]}
