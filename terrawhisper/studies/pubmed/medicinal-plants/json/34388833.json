Genomic-based botanical identification methods are evolving and emerging as useful quality control tools to complement traditional morphological and chemical identification methods. Species-specific polymerase chain reaction methods are being evaluated for botanical quality control and as a cost-effective approach to identify and discriminate between closely related botanical species. This paper describes orthogonal identification of <i>Panax ginseng, P. quinquefolius,</i> and <i>P. notoginseng</i> materials in commerce as an example of the development and validation of a set of species-specific polymerase chain reaction methods to establish botanical identity in ginseng roots. This work also explored the possibility of extending the application of species-specific polymerase chain reaction methods to provide species identity information for processed materials, such as steamed roots and hydroalcoholic extracts, and showed success with this approach. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for an out-of-specification investigation of samples that may pass some of the orthogonal tests and fail others."], "CopyrightInformation": "Thieme.
