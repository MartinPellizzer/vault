The medicinal plants of these three genera are closely related, and their traditional curative effects are similar. As representative compounds, phenethyl glycosides are predominantly dominant type both in amount and in chemical structural varieties, which are considered to be the important bioactive material basis of these genera. In this paper, phenethyl glycosides and their pharmacological activities are described in a single list. In addition, the other compounds were also reviewed in order to better compare the difference of the bioactive substances. These findings have important reference value for effective development and rational utilization of resources of medicinal plants in the family Orobanchaceae."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot 010110, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Qin", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot 010110, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot 010110, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inner Mongolia Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hohhot 010110, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Cai-Feng", "Initials": "CF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inner Mongolia Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hohhot 010110, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Min-Hui", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cistanche"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Orobanchaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Orobanche"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30717549", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180912.002"]}}]}
