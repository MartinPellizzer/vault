Accumulating evidence suggests that CRP and its components are effective in preventing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, arrhythmia, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and hypertension. Studies show that the two most bioactive components of CRP are flavonoids and volatile oils. The cardiovascular protective effects of CRP have attracted considerable research interest due to its hypolipidemic, antiplatelet activity, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Hereby, we provide a rigorous and up-to-date overview of the cardiovascular protective properties and the potential molecular targets of CRP, and finally highlight the pharmacokinetics and the therapeutic potential of the main pharmacologically active components of CRP to treat CVDs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
