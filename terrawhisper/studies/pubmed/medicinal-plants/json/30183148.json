Kanokoso Valeriana fauriei Briquet is referring to Ezokanokoso Valeriana fauriei forma yezoensis Hara, which is the same variety. The Hokkai-kisso currently cultivated in Japan is the Ezokanokoso variety. The author analyzed the history of the variety of Japanese Valerian previously cultivated, but it\u2019s incomplete. To maintain the quality and efficacy of a medicine, it is important to disseminate information regarding the origin of the crude drug. To ensure the quality of Kanokoso and stable efficacy of the medicine, it\u2019s indispensable to maintain the original plant variety when cultivated.The author obtained the following knowledge during research. The variety cultivated in Kanagawa early in the Showa era was Japanese Valerian, sometimes being two kinds, lobule and round leaf. It is presumed that the original variety cultivated in Kanagawa early in the Showa era was Hokkai-kisso.The ingredients of the variety of Japanese Valerian cultivated and that which grows wild vary. The basis of the chemical structure of sesqui terpene kinds of \u03b1-Kessyl alcohol (KA) and Kessyl glycol diacetate (KGD), etc. has Kessane skeleton. It\u2019s this consistency and is gathered using the same type of system. The consistency is interesting. Pursuing the relation between the consistency and type of system is regarded as a problem. To obtain the same kind of ingredient and form from Hokkai-kisso in the current state seems difficult. To maintain today\u2019s quality of Hokkai-kisso and medicinal efficacy, it\u2019s important for continue to cultivating the plant by dividing the roots for replanting."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yanagisawa", "ForeName": "Kiyohisa", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakushigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "1267223", "ISSNLinking": "0285-2314"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypnotics and Sedatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Psychotropic Drugs"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypnotics and Sedatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Psychotropic Drugs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Valerian"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30183148"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
