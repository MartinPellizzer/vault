We prepared crude water, protein, and polysaccharide extracts from Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz, Helianthus annuus L., Scutellaria barbata D. Don, and Hedyotis diffusa Willd, respectively, and compared their immune-stimulating activities in vitro and in vivo. All protein and polysaccharide samples of the plants led to greater lymphocyte proliferation and TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 production in cultured splenocytes than did the crude water extracts at the same concentrations tested. In addition, the protein and polysaccharide samples did not contain lectin- or lipopolysaccharide-like molecules, so glycoproteins were deduced to be responsible for the lymphocyte stimulation. Oral administration with each of the samples enhanced the hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL)-specific humoral immune and lymphocyte proliferative responses in HEL low-responder C57BL/6 mice. Splenocytes from the mice fed the samples showed significantly greater increases in the level of IFN-\u03b3, but not IL-4, after stimulation with HEL compared with that from the untreated control. However, higher increases in HEL-specific IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG3 rather than IgG2a were found in the mice fed the samples. These results indicate that the sample-mediated enhancement of anti-HEL-specific humoral immune responses was due to the stimulation of B lymphocytes rather than a selective priming of helper T cell populations. Collectively, we suggest that glycoproteins and/or polysaccharides of traditional herbal remedies enhance cellular and humoral immune response induction and thus could be useful for patients who need enhanced immune function."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Cell Dynamics Research Center and School of Life Sciences, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology , Gwangju, South Korea ."}], "LastName": "Son", "ForeName": "Young-Ok", "Initials": "YO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Research Center of Bioactive Materials, Chonbuk National University , Jeonju, South Korea ."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Institute of Oral Biosciences and School of Dentistry, Chonbuk National University , Jeonju, South Korea ."}], "LastName": "Kook", "ForeName": "Sung-Ho", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Research Center of Bioactive Materials, Chonbuk National University , Jeonju, South Korea ."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Institute of Oral Biosciences and School of Dentistry, Chonbuk National University , Jeonju, South Korea ."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jeong-Chae", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin G"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "207137-56-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-4"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "hen egg lysozyme"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.17", "NameOfSubstance": "Muramidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "B-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Immunity, Cellular"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Immunity, Humoral"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin G"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-4"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Muramidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28816630", "10.1089/jmf.2017.3943"]}}]}
