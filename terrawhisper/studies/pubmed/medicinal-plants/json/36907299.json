Short circular DNA nanotechnology synthesized a stiff and compact DNA nanotubes (DNA-NTs) framework. TW-37, a small molecular drug, was loaded into DNA-NTs for BH3-mimetic therapy to elevate the intracellular cytochrome-c levels in 2D/3D hypopharyngeal tumor (FaDu) cell clusters. After anti-EGFR functionalization, the DNA-NTs were tethered with a cytochrome-c binding aptamer, which can be applied to evaluate the elevated intracellular cytochrome-c levels via in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The results showed that DNA-NTs were enriched within the tumor cells via anti-EGFR targeting with a pH-responsive controlled release of TW-37. In this way, it initiated the triple inhibition of \"BH3, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1\". The triple inhibition of these proteins caused Bax/Bak oligomerization, leading to the perforation of the mitochondrial membrane. This led to the elevation of intracellular cytochrome-c levels, which reacted with the cytochrome-c binding aptamer to produce FRET signals. In this way, we successfully targeted 2D/3D clusters of FaDu tumor cells and achieved the tumor-specific and pH-triggered release of TW-37, causing tumor cell apoptosis. This pilot study suggests that anti-EGFR functionalized, TW-37 loaded, and cytochrome-c binding aptamer tethered DNA-NTs might be the hallmark for early tumor diagnosis and therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
