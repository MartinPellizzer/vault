Visfatin is an adipokine that, in addition to being involved in metabolism and inflammation, may also be interested in carcinogenesis. Visfatin measurement in cancer patients has shown that visfatin levels in cancer patients differed from those in healthy subjects. Various studies have shown that the level of visfatin is increased in people within EC and BC, and this difference has a significant relationship with prognosis.", "A comprehensive search of related articles from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Google Scholar database was done by November 2021. Eligible articles measured visfatin levels in patients with breast cancer and EC. After selecting the eligible studies, the data were extracted and analyzed using the random effect method.", "Given the effect size and the confidence interval obtained, the total level of visfatin in cancer patients was different from that in healthy individuals, and this difference was statistically significant. However, the difference in visfatin levels in patients with breast cancer was much more significant than in patients with EC compared to the control group.", "Due to the significant increase in visfatin levels in these patients, visfatin may be a potential prognostic factor in breast and ECs. Visfatin levels in cancer patients differed from those in healthy subjects, and this difference was also statistically significant (<i>p</i>-values\u2009=\u20090.00). Visfatin levels also differed between breast cancer patients and healthy individuals, which was statistically significant (<i>p</i>-values\u2009=\u20090.00).
