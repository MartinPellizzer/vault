L. Robinson) root extract was investigated for its possible ulceroprotective activity in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Oral administration of this extract (50, 100, or 150 mg/kg) significantly prevented the occurrence of water immersion stress-induced gastric ulcers in a dose-responsive manner. The extract also dose-dependently inhibited gastric ulcers induced by ethanol, aspirin, and phenylbutazone. The ED50 values of the extract in the above four ulcer models were found to be 95.1, 109.7, 125.5, and 136.2 mg/kg, respectively. The volume, acidity, and peptic activity of the gastric juice in pylorous-ligated rats were not altered upon administration of the extract (100 or 150 mg/kg) but it significantly and dose-dependently promoted the gastric mucus secretion in normal as well as stress- and ethanol-induced ulcerated animals. Based on these results, we conclude that M. cordata root extract possesses antiulcer activity and that the observed activity may be due to the modulation of defensive factors through an improvement of gastric cytoprotection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Jadavpur University, Calcutta, India."}], "LastName": "Bishayee", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chatterjee", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8202558", "10.1055/s-2006-959428"]}}]}
