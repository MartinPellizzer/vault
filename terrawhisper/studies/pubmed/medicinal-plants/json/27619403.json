This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done on 68 women diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria aged 18-40 years old. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups to receive either 1000\u00a0mg omega-3 fatty acids from flaxseed oil containing 400\u00a0mg \u03b1-Linolenic acid plus 400 IU vitamin E supplements (n\u00a0=\u00a034) or placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a034) for 12 weeks. Lp(a) and Ox-LDL mRNA levels were quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of PCOS women with RT-PCR method. Lipid profiles and biomarkers of oxidative stress were quantified at the beginning of the study and after 12-week intervention. Quantitative results of RT-PCR demonstrated that compared with the placebo, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation downregulated expressed levels of Lp(a) mRNA (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and Ox-LDL mRNA (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of women with PCOS. In addition, compared to the placebo group, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in serum triglycerides (-22.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.3 vs.\u00a0+7.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023.6\u00a0mg/dL, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), VLDL- (-4.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5 vs.\u00a0+1.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7\u00a0mg/dL, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), total- (-20.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.6 vs.\u00a0+12.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.1\u00a0mg/dL, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), LDL- (-16.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.3 vs.\u00a0+11.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.1\u00a0mg/dL, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and total-/HDL-cholesterol (-0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6 vs.\u00a0+0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Overall, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation for 12 weeks in PCOS women significantly improved gene expression of Lp(a) and Ox-LDL, lipid profiles and biomarkers of oxidative stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
