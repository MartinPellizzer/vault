Their structures were unambiguously elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic methods. The planar structure and relative configuration of 1 was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The enantiomers of compounds 1, 2, 4 were further resolved by semi-preparative chiral HPLC, and the absolute configurations of enantiomers of compounds 1 and 4 were determined by measurement and calculation of electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra and specific rotations. The inhibitory activities of the isolated compounds against human HeLa, A549, PC-3, HT-29, and WPMY-1 cell lines were assayed, and garcibractatin A (4) showed the most potent inhibitory activities in vitro with IC<sub>50</sub> values from 1.11 to 2.93\u202f\u03bcM. A preliminary structure-activity relationship has been discussed, and some helpful conclusions have been drawn."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
