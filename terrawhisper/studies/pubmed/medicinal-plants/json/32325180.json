Unani is a traditional medicine system based on hundreds of years of observations and experiences. Wounds are described under the headings qarha (arabic) and jar\u0101hat (persian) in classical Unani texts. Several drugs of herbal, mineral and animal origin are described in Unani texts as having wound healing properties. Many of these drugs have been screened on various scientific parameters but the potential of most drugs remains unexplored.", "The study was aimed at summarizing the topical wound healing drugs mentioned in classical Unani books. The topical wound healing drugs were first identified in classical texts. Then 20 drugs were selected for detailed review on the basis of clinical relevance and wide availability.", "Seventy drugs were identified in Unani texts after removal of duplicacy. Most of the drugs (85.71%) were of herbal origin, while 10% were of mineral origin and the rest 4.28% were of animal origin. Most of the herbal drugs belonged to the Fabaceae (10%) and Rosaceae (8.33%) families. Biologically active compounds such as phenols, sterols, hydrocarbons, anthocyanidins, flavonoids and tannins have been identified in almost all drugs which support classical literature.", "Unani system of medicine has a rich legacy of effective wound healing drugs, which is reinforced by modern researches. Most drugs exert their action on multiple phases of wound healing. In addition, most drugs have no reported adverse effects in laboratory and clinical studies. Hence, Unani medicine may offer the much-needed affordable and effective wound care in a wide range of clinical settings."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
