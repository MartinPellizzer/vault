However, this problem can be overcome by ensuring the identification of traded medicinal plants which are used in making different herbal medicines. In this regard, palynological markers are considered to be an important taxonomic tool in the identification of original medicinal plant from its adulterant. Hence this study attempted to provide particular reliable palynological markers for distinguishing selected medicinal plants from their adulterants, that is, Cinnamomum verum versus Canella winterana, Cinnamomum tamala versus Cinnamomum obtusifolium, Gymnema sylvestre versus Gymnema lactiferum, Artemisia maritima versus Artemisia absinthium, Achillea millefolium versus Adhatoda vasaka, Sphaeranthus indicus versus Sphaeranthus africanus, Averrhoa carambola versus Butea monosperma, and Morus nigra versus Morus alba. Results demonstrated great variations in multiple palynological characters between original medicinal plant and its adulterant such as in pollen size, shape, colpi length, exine, intine thickness, and fertility. In equatorial view, circular to spheroidal shape of pollen was found in A. millefolium while oblate shape was observed in A. vasaka. Similarly B. monosperma pollen was 34\u2009\u03bcm, whereas pollen of its adulterant A. carambola was 21\u2009\u03bcm. Moreover, colpi length of A. maritima was 11.8 \u03bcm, whereas 4.5 \u03bcm in A. absinthium. Hence it can be concluded that palynological characters are commendably helpful in identification of genuine medicinal plant from its adulterant."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Lahore College For Women University, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ramzan", "ForeName": "Sehrish", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9178-6963"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Lahore College For Women University, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shaheen", "ForeName": "Shabnum", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioinformatics & Biotechnology, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Khadim", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food safety research center (salt), Semnan University of medical sciences, Semnan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sharifi-Rad", "ForeName": "Javad", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioinformatics & Biotechnology, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Muhammad Asaf", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Lahore College For Women University, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Harun", "ForeName": "Nidaa", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Lahore College For Women University, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Jaffer", "ForeName": "Mehwish", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Lahore College For Women University, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Farah", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Microsc Res Tech", "NlmUniqueID": "9203012", "ISSNLinking": "1059-910X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "classification", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30801919", "10.1002/jemt.23240"]}}]}
