They were also tested and compared for wound healing, angiogenesis, and hepatoprotective effect using <i>in vitro</i> assays.", "Statistically significant increase in the proliferation of primary rat fibroblast, MSCs, and angiogenesis was observed after treatment with aqueous flower extract. The aqueous leaf extract determined a comparatively moderate increment in the proliferation of MSCs and angiogenesis. It however showed prominent cytotoxicity to cancer cell lines and a significant hepatoprotective effect.", "A very clear difference in response of the two extracts to different types of cells was detected in this study. The aqueous flower extract exhibited a higher potential to stimulate cell proliferation while not exerting the same effect on cancer cell lines. The leaf extract on the other hand, had a prominent antitumor and hepatoptotective effects.", "<i>Moringa oleifera</i> flower extract showed significant ability to promote proliferation of rat fibroblast and mesenchymal stem cells. The extract also had prominent angiogenic and hepatoprotective effects.The extract did not influence proliferation of cancer cell lines indicating its safety for human consumption and use in pharmaceuticals.The <i>Moringa oleifera</i> leaf extract showed relatively less potential to stimulate cells but had prominent cytotoxic effect on cancer cell lines. <b>Abbreviations Used</b>: ALT: Alanine transaminase, AST: Asparatate amino transferase, ATCC: American type culture collection, BMMSC: Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (used in this paper), CAM: Chick chorioallantoic membrane, CCl4: Carbon tetra chloride, DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium, DMSO: Dimethyl sulfoxide, EDTA: Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, HBL 100: Human breast epithelial cell line, Mcf-7: Human breast adenocarcinoma cell line, aMEM: Minimum Essential Medium Eagle alpha modification, MOF: <i>Moringa oleifera</i> aqueous flower extract (used in this paper), MOL: <i>Moringa oleifera</i> aqueos leaf extract (Used in this paper), OD: Optical density, PBS: Phosphate buffered saline."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of IT and Biotechnology, Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University, Pune, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Fernandes", "ForeName": "Evangeline E", "Initials": "EE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of IT and Biotechnology, Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University, Pune, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Pulwale", "ForeName": "Anubha V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of IT and Biotechnology, Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University, Pune, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Patil", "ForeName": "Gauri A", "Initials": "GA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of IT and Biotechnology, Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University, Pune, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Moghe", "ForeName": "Alpana S", "Initials": "AS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacognosy Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101558769", "ISSNLinking": "0974-8490"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Solowey E, Lichtenstein M, Sallon S, Paavilainen H, Solowey E, Lorberboum-Galski H.
