Studies were performed using-LAB strains isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of calves and piglets. These strains exhibited an antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains of Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli. Cell adhesiveness was examined in relation to the porcine and bovine mucin. Our analyses had shown that the tested microorganisms demonstrated a degree of adhesion in the range of 32.00-40.00% for strains isolated from calves, and 34.00-40.00% for strains isolated from pigs. The hydrophobicity of tested bacteria was in the range of 31.00%-44.00% for strains isolated from pigs, and 26.00%-42.00% for strains obtained from calves. The best mucin adhesion ability was found for bacterial strains belonging to the Enterococcus genus isolated from calves. Taking into account porcine isolates, the best adhesion was observed for the Leuconostoc bacterial strains. Among tested strains, the highest hydrophobicity, measured in relation to hexadecane, was recorded for the bacterial strains belonging to the Leuconostoc sp. isolated from piglets and a of Lactobacillus sp. bacterial strain isolated from calves."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Innovative Biomaterials and Nanotechnologies, Institute of Natural Fibres and Medicinal Plants, Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "Grajek", "ForeName": "Katarzyna", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology and Food Microbiology, University of Life Sciences, Poland, Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "Sip", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Innovative Biomaterials and Nanotechnologies, Institute of Natural Fibres and Medicinal Plants, Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "Foksowicz-Flaczyk", "ForeName": "Joanna", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology and Food Microbiology, University of Life Sciences, Poland, Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "Dobrowolska", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology and Food Microbiology, University of Life Sciences, Poland, Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "Wita", "ForeName": "Agnieszka", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Acta Biochim Pol", "NlmUniqueID": "14520300R", "ISSNLinking": "0001-527X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mucins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibiosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Clostridium perfringens"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Tract"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactobacillus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Viability"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mucins"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sus scrofa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27231726", "10.18388/abp.2015_1128", "1660"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
