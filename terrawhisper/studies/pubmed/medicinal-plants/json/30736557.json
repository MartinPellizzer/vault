(Euphorbiaceae), a mangrove species. Nodal segments were used for axillary shoot proliferation. One shoot from each node of binodal explants was observed 3 weeks after inoculation. The best axillary sprouting was seen on a newly formulated medium containing BA, Zeatin and IBA in concentrations of 13.3 \u03bcM, 4.65 \u03bcM and 1.23 \u03bcM, respectively. The new medium, first used in this study, has a specific composition of major nutrients, MS micronutrients and iron compounds. Nodal segments from rooted cuttings and seedlings responded better than those of mature tree explants. Multiple shoot induction was complemented with efficient shoot elongation, and repeated subculture of binodal segments from axillary shoots resulted in 10-12 shoots per explant in 3 months. Rooting was achieved by growing shoots in the new medium with 0.23 \u03bcM IBA. Regenerated plants were successfully acclimatized to the natural environment, and about 85% of plantlets survived under ex vitro conditions. This is the first report of micropropagation in the genus Excoecaria and also in mangrove tree species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "M.
