Plants give us a distinct class of natural compounds, commonly called secondary metabolites and better examples are the flavonoids, phenols, terpenoids, alkaloids, tannins, and carotenoids. Plant derived phytoproducts have been used for the treatment of human disorders in both traditional as well as modern medicine. Naturally occurring aporphines and their synthetic derivatives are well known in medicine for their pharmacological activities, including an affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic and serotonergic receptors. (+)-nantenine is an aporphine alkaloid isolated from Nandina domestica and other plants. The aim of the present study is to analyze the biological potential and therapeutic effectiveness of nantenine in medicine. In the present work scientific information of nantenine for their medicinal uses and pharmacological activities have been collected from scientific databases such as Google, Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct . Scientific information of nantenine was further analyzed to know their health beneficial aspects in medicine. However, the detail pharmacological activity of nantenine has been discussed in the present work with its analytical aspects. Scientific data analysis described the medicinal importance and pharmacological activities of nantenine. Nantenine revealed adrenergic response, behavioral response, cardiovascular effect, vasorelaxant effect, acetylcholinesterase inhibitory potential, cytotoxicity, and biphasic tracheal relaxation. Present work also signified the biological potential of nantenine for their anti-inflammatory activity, anticonvulsant effect, antiserotonergic activities, anti-MDMA effect, antileishmanial activity, effect on histamine and serotonin, human 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT(2A)) and h5-HT(2B) receptors and isolated tissues. Further, the analytical techniques used for the separation, isolation and identification of nantenine have also been described in this work. The present scientific data describes the therapeutic potential and pharmacological activities of (+)-nantenine in medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8138-6379"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Prayagraj, 211007, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Dinesh Kumar", "Initials": "DK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Prayagraj, 211007, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Kanika", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Infect Disord Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "101269158", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5265"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "XE0AU8C122", "NameOfSubstance": "nantenine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "13NS2KTD6H", "NameOfSubstance": "aporphine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aporphines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "333DO1RDJY", "NameOfSubstance": "Serotonin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adrenergic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Aporphines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Serotonin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adrenergic Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37881077", "10.2174/0118715265244269231010090316", "IDDT-EPUB-135460"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
