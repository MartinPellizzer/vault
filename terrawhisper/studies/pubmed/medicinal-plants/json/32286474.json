However, there is currently no effective strategy to prevent the development of DCM. Although cyclovirobuxine D (CVB-D) has been widely used to treat multiple cardiovascular diseases, the possible beneficial effects of CVB-D on DCM remained unknown. The present aim was to explore the potential effects and underlying mechanisms of CVB-D on DCM. We explored the effects of CVB-D in DCM by using high fat high sucrose\u00a0diet and streptozotocin-induced rat\u00a0DCM model. Cardiac function and survival in rats with DCM were improved via the amelioration of oxidative damage after CVB-D treatment. Our data also demonstrated that pre-treatment with CVB-D exerted a remarkable cytoprotective effect against high glucose -or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> -induced neonatal rat cardiomyocyte damage via the suppression of reactive oxygen species accumulation and restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential; this effect was associated with promotion of Nrf2 nuclear translocation and its downstream antioxidative stress signals (NQO-1, Prdx1). Overall, the present data has provided the first evidence that CVB-D has potential therapeutic in DCM, mainly by activation of the Nrf2 signalling pathway to suppress oxidative stress. Our findings also have positive implications on the novel promising clinical applications of CVB-D."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The
