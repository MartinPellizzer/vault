Total phenol and flavonoids content were determined colorimetrically using Folin Ciocalteu and aluminum chloride reagents, respectively. 1,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was utilized for estimation of antioxidant activity, cytotoxic activity was determined on Hep-G2, HCT- 116, and MCF-7 cell lines, and agar diffusion method was used for screening of antimicrobial activity while cytopathic effect inhibition assay was utilized for antiviral assay.", "Twenty-eight metabolites were identified, flavonoids were predominated (26), it was characterized by the presence of four main aglycones (Apigenin, luteolin, quercetin and kaempferol) with their O and/or C-glycosides based on its MS fragments. ME and EAF significantly scavenged DPPH in a dose-dependent manner with IC<sub>50</sub> 16.99 and 18.74 \u03bcg.mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Among the tested samples, only ME and EAF showed significant cytotoxic activity against the tested cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> ranging from 5.541- 9.509 \u03bcg.mL<sup>-1</sup>. All tested samples significantly inhibited the growth of the tested bacterial strains with inhibition zone diameters ranging from 11.2- 26.4 mm and showed a wide range of antiviral activity.", "Generally, S. fallax is potentially bioactive as evident by antioxidant, cytotoxic, antibacterial, and antiviral assays. These activities are correlated with its identified metabolites. The results proved that S. fallax has promising medicinal activities and would be examined in future clinical trials for herbal therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, 11549, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ibrahim", "ForeName": "Taghreed", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, 11371, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hegazy", "ForeName": "Mostafa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, 11371, Egypt."}], "LastName": "El-Hela", "ForeName": "Atef", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Kaempferols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7V515PI7F6", "NameOfSubstance": "Apigenin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KUX1ZNC9J2", "NameOfSubstance": "Luteolin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3CYT62D3GA", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8PJ61P6TS3", "NameOfSubstance": "1-Butanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-18-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Agar"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kaempferols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apigenin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luteolin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "1-Butanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "29"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35139788", "10.2174/1389201023666220209125306", "CPB-EPUB-120773"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
