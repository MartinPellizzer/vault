Throughout a 3600-fold purification the ratio of D-phenylalanine N-malonyltransferase activity to ACC N-malonyltransferase activity was unchanged. Antibodies raised against purified ACC N-malonyltransferase 55-kDa protein were also able to precipitate all D-phenylalanine-directed activity from partially purified mung bean extracts. The irreversible inhibitors phenylglyoxal and tetranitromethane reduced malonyltransferase activity towards D-phenylalanine to the same extent as that for ACC. In addition, several other D-amino acids, particularly D-tryptophan and D-tyrosine, were able to inhibit action towards both ACC and D-phenylalanine. These lines of evidence suggest that a single enzyme is capable of promoting malonylation of both ACC and D-phenylalanine. Km values for D-phenylalanine and malonyl-CoA were found to be 48 and 43 microM, respectively; these values are 10-fold lower than the corresponding values when ACC was substrate. Coenzyme A was a noncompetitive (mixed type) product inhibitor towards malonyl-CoA at both unsaturated and saturated ACC concentrations. The enzyme was also inhibited uncompetitively at high concentrations of malonyl-CoA. We propose that the enzyme follows an Ordered Bi-Bi reaction pathway, with the amino acid substrate being bound initially."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticulture, Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "A T", "Initials": "AT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Arteca", "ForeName": "R N", "Initials": "RN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids, Cyclic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9EJ633GL", "NameOfSubstance": "1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "47E5O17Y3R", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylalanine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "D-amino acid malonyltransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K1G7CKU98F", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetranitromethane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N45G3015PA", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylglyoxal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TE7660XO1C", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids, Cyclic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylalanine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylglyoxal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tetranitromethane"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8244971", "S0021-9258(19)74404-4"]}}]}
