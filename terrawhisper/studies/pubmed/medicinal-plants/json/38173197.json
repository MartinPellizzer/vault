Gossypol is a natural phenolic compound isolated from the seed of cotton plants, and gossypol acetic acid (GAA) is a medicinal form of Gossypol. Recently, various biological activities of GAA, including anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects, have been widely reported. However, its effect on chondrocytes in OA has yet to be determined.", "In this study, we investigated the effect of GAA on ferroptosis in OA chondrocytes. The effect of GAA on the cell viability and cytotoxicity of chondrocytes in rat cells was investigated using CCK8. Western blotting, Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and immunofluorescence staining were used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways of GAA inhibition of ferroptosis in OA chondrocytes. The effect of GAA on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lipid peroxidation levels in chondrocytes was examined using dihydroethidium (DHE) staining and fluorescent dye BODIPY581/591 C11. in vivo, micro-CT imaging, hematoxylin and eosin staining, Safranin O-Fast staining, and immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate the effects of GAA on OA cartilage.", "The results showed that GAA treatment regulated the expression of chondrocyte extracellular matrix (ECM) related factors, including ADAMTS5, MMP13, SOX9, Aggrecan, and COL1A2 and reduced the ROS and lipid peroxidation levels. Besides, Erastin could reverse the effects of GAA on chondrocytes. Similar to GAA, 5-AZA caused the reduction of ROS and lipid peroxidation levels and reversed the effect of IL-1\u03b2 on the expression of ECM-related factors in OA chondrocytes. The above results clarified that GAA alleviated the ferroptosis of chondrocytes in OA by inhibiting GPX4 methylation.", "Our findings revealed that GAA might be developed as a drug for treating OA clinically."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, The Affiliated Changzhou Second People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, Jiangsu 213000, China."}], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "JingJing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, The Affiliated Changzhou Second People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University;Changzhou Medical Center, Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, 213000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, Zhangjiajie People's Hospital, Zhangjiajie, 427000, China."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Chenwei", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, 218 Jixi Road, Shushan District, Hefei, Anhui, 230022, PR China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, The Affiliated Changzhou Second People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University;Changzhou Medical Center, Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, 213000, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Zhentang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, The Affiliated Changzhou Second People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University;Changzhou Medical Center, Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, 213000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Junjie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, The Affiliated Changzhou Second People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University;Changzhou Medical Center, Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, 213000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, The Affiliated Changzhou Second People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University;Changzhou Medical Center, Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, 213000, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Long", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, The Affiliated Changzhou Second People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University;Changzhou Medical Center, Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, 213000, China."}], "LastName": "Miao", "ForeName": "Kaisong", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, The Affiliated Changzhou Second People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University;Changzhou Medical Center, Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, 213000, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Changlin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, The Affiliated Changzhou Second People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University;Changzhou Medical Center, Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, 213000, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, The Affiliated Changzhou Second People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University;Changzhou Medical Center, Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, 213000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xindie", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38173197", "10.2174/0109298673280730231211092905", "CMC-EPUB-136954"]}}]}
