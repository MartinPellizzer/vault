They have been used since ancient times because of their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and carminative properties. Several scientific studies have suggested their protective role against chronic diseases. In fact, their active compounds may help in arthritis, neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's, Parkinson, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc.), diabetes, sore muscles, gastrointestinal problems and many more. In the present study, possible roles of spices and their active components, in chronic diseases (cancer, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, etc.) along with their mechanism of action have been reviewed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Belgrade, Faculty of Biology, Institute of Botany and Botanical Garden \"Jevremovac\", 11 000 Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Bukvicki", "ForeName": "Danka", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences, University of Bologna, Piazza Goidanich 60, 47521 Cesena, Italy."}], "LastName": "Gottardi", "ForeName": "Davide", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77054, United States."}], "LastName": "Prasad", "ForeName": "Sahdeo", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Belgrade, National Institute, Institute of Chemistry, Technology and Metallurgy, Njego\u0161eva 12, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Novakovic", "ForeName": "Miroslav", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Belgrade, Faculty of Biology, Institute of Botany and Botanical Garden \"Jevremovac\", 11 000 Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Marin", "ForeName": "Petar D", "Initials": "PD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77054, United States."}], "LastName": "Tyagi", "ForeName": "Amit Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spices"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30182845", "10.2174/0929867325666180831145800", "CMC-EPUB-92740"]}}]}
