Surveys for root rot of F. forsythiae were conducted from 2021 to 2022 in China's major planting areas (Daweiyuan Village, Sanguandong Forest Area, Yunxi County, Shiyan City, Hubei Province, 32\u00b052'52\"N, 110\u00b019'29\"E). The disease has occurred in several plantations. A total of 200 F. forsythiae were investigated, among which 112 were diseased, the incidence rate was more than 50%, and all the plants in the plantation were over 3 years old. The roots of diseased plants were fully covered by white mycelia. When the disease was severe, leaves curled and fell, roots withered, and some eventually died. A total of 22 isolates were isolated from the 18 infected tissues of\u00a0F. forsythiae and purified by single spore cultures on PDA medium. The 22 isolates similared in morphology to isolate Lianmao (The name is one of the five sequenced samples in the lab) were selected to be representative of the group. The results showed that these samples belonged to the same pathogen. The isolates were characterized by yellowish colonies composed of tall and short sporangiophores 6 to 11 \u03bcm in width, terminal and globose sporangia, ellipsoidal sporangiospores with dimensions of 5 to 8 \u03bcm in length and 4 to 5 \u03bcm in width, and obovoid columellae. It was identified as Mucor circinelloides, based on morphological characteristics (Schipper 1976). The ITS and LSU sequences of the fungus were amplified, and sequenced with the primers ITS1/ITS4 and LROR/LR5 (White et al. 1990; Rehner et al. 1994). Sequences from isolate Lianmao were deposited in GenBank (accession nos. OQ359158 for ITS, OQ359157 for\u00a0LSU). Analysis using the BLAST algorithm of the two amplified sequences showed 99.69 to 100% similarity with the sequences (KY933391 and MH868051) of\u00a0M. circinelloides.\u00a0The isolated M. circinelloides was prepared into 150ml spore suspension (The method was to filter the PDB after 10 days of culture using gauze to get spore suspension. Then the concentration of spore suspension was diluted to 1.0\u00d7106 spores/ml using sterile water). The spore suspension was subsequently inoculated into healthy potted F. forsythiae plants. Uninoculated potted F. forsythiae plants served as controls. All the potted F. forsythiae plants were incubated at 25\u00b0C under 12h light and 12h dark conditions. The symptoms of the infected plants were similar to those observed in the field; The control plants were symptomless. The pathogen reisolated from symptomatic roots and morphologically identified as M. circinelloides. M. circinelloides has been reported as a pathogen of Morinda citrifolia, Aconitum carmichaelii\u2002and so on (Cui et al. 2021; Nishijima et al. 2011), but it has never been reported on F. forsythiae before. This is the first report of root rot caused by M.circinelloides on F. forsythiae. This pathogen may present a threat to the production of F. forsythiae in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shiyan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 17 Renmin Nan Lu, Maojian District, Shiyan City, Hubei Province, Shiyan City, Hubei province, China, 442000; 1024215796@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shiyan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shiyan City, Hubei province, China; 2074814378@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Han", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shiyan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shiyan City, Hubei province, China; 117298907@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shiyan Academy of Agricultural Science, shiyan , Hubei , China; 541584951@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Ouyang", "ForeName": "Youxiang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shiyan Academy of Agricultural Science, shiyan , Hubei , China; gmy199404@163.com."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Mengyun", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shiyan Academy of Agricultural Science, south road renmin, shiyan , Hubei , China, 442000; caigaolei@163.com."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Gaolei", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shiyan Academy of Agricultural Science, shiyan , Hubei , China; 1750552838@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Haidong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37172975", "10.1094/PDIS-02-23-0339-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
