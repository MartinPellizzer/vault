However, traditional fermentation methods suffer from poor production control. In contrast, probiotic fermented herbal medicine (PFHM) offers advantages such as the use of pure strains, a controllable process, and the ability to produce a variety of active enzymes during fermentation. As a result, PFHM has become a research hotspot. This review focuses on the progress, challenges, and opportunities in the research of PFHM. The use of probiotic enzymes during fermentation alters the active ingredients of TCM, resulting in positive pharmacological effects such as increased active ingredients, reduced toxicity, new pharmacological effects, and the reuse of herbal residues. PFHM has the potential to transfer the metabolic transformation of the effective components of TCM by intestinal flora outside the body during production and preparation, which has a broad application prospect. However, due to the complexity of the chemical composition of TCM, the mechanism of PFHM requires further investigation. Finally, we discuss the prospects of industrializing PFHM, which is essential for promoting the innovation and modernization of TCM."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Metabolic Diseases, Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100053, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Hao-Yu", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Metabolic Diseases, Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100053, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrinology, South Area of Guang'anmen, Hospital China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 102618, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Yi-Qun", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Metabolic Diseases, Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100053, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Metabolic Diseases, Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100053, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Metabolic Diseases, Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100053, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Lin-Hua", "Initials": "LH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Metabolic Diseases, Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100053, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Xiao-Lin", "Initials": "XL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Am J Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7901431", "ISSNLinking": "0192-415X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Probiotics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37357176", "10.1142/S0192415X23500519"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
