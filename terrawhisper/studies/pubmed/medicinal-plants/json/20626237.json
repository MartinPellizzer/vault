Results of chemical analysis for moisture and volatiles, water-insoluble components, refractive index, soluble solids content, raw fiber, invert sugar, total ash, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, acidity, and pH were calculated as 17.06%, 2.55%, 1.491, 80.2%, 0.70%, 40.54%, 0.13%, 44\u2009mg/kg, 0.9% anhydrous citric acid, and 3.6, respectively. Mesir paste was extracted individually by six solvents with different polarity, and antimicrobial activities of each extracts were determined against 12 microbial strains, mostly food-borne, including pathogens, by the agar well diffusion method. All extracts obtained showed antimicrobial activity ranging from 8\u2009mm to 40\u2009mm, and the butanolic extract displayed stronger antimicrobial activity against all tested microorganisms; Gram-positive strains were found to be more sensitive than Gram-negative strains. Antimicrobial potency of n-butanol extracts of mesir paste was determined in term of minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration for the sensitive microorganisms. In addition, some commercial antibiotics such as ampicillin, gentamicin, and nystatin were used as positive controls to determine the sensitivity of the strains."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biology Department, Faculty of Sciences & Arts, Celal Bayar University, Manisa, Turkey. mustafa.oskay@bayar.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oskay", "ForeName": "Mustafa", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karayildirim", "ForeName": "Tamer", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ay", "ForeName": "Emriye", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ay", "ForeName": "Kadir", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8PJ61P6TS3", "NameOfSubstance": "1-Butanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "1-Butanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Negative Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Positive Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Spices"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20626237", "10.1089/jmf.2009.0209"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
