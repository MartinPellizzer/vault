(PO), a traditional Chinese herb known for its anti-myocardial ischemic properties, were investigated for cardio-protective properties. Specifically, OVQ-Nanoparticles (OVQ-NPs) with Orientin (Ori), Vitexin (Vit), and Quercetin (Que) was obtained by double emulsion-solvent evaporation method. The OVQ-NPs exhibited a spherical shape, with a uniform size distribution of 136.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.88\u00a0nm and a stable \u03b6-potential of -13.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.24\u00a0mV. Notably, these nanoparticles exhibited a favorable sustained-release characteristic, resulting in an extended circulation time within the living organism. Consequently, the administration of these nanoparticles resulted in significant improvements in electrocardiograms and heart mass index of myocardial ischemic rats induced by isoproterenol, as well as decreased serum levels of CK, LDH, and AST. Furthermore, the results of histopathological examination, such as H&E staining and TUNEL staining, confirmed a reduced level of cardiac tissue pathology and apoptosis. Moreover, the quantification of biochemical indicators (SOD, MDA, GSH, NO, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6) demonstrated that OVQ-NPs effectively mitigated myocardial ischemia by regulating oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways. In conclusion, OVQ-NPs demonstrate promising therapeutic potential as an intervention for myocardial ischemia, providing a new perspective on traditional Chinese medicine treatment in this area."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
