Ovariectomy (OVX) and calcium deficiency (CD) resulted in bone loss as evident from decreased femoral weight and density. Treatment with OST-6 at a dose of 250 mg/kg body wt twice a day orally for a period of 16 weeks significantly restored the femoral weight and density. The biomechanical strength of the tibia was decreased by OVX and CD and this was significantly suppressed by the administration of OST-6. Histologically decalcified bone sections revealed narrowed, and the disappearance of, trabeculae and widened medullary spaces. The total numbers of tartrate-resistant acid phosphates (TRAP) positive cells were increased significantly in OVX animals. Treatment with OST-6 significantly inhibited these histopathological changes and strongly suggested that OST-6 was effective in preventing the progress of bone loss induced by ovariectomy and concurrent calcium deficiency."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Government College of Pharmacy, Bangalore, 560027, India. p.reddy@indiatimes.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reddy", "ForeName": "N Prabhakara", "Initials": "NP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lakshmana", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Udupa", "ForeName": "U Venkatesh", "Initials": "UV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "OST-6 preparation"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomechanical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Density"}, {"QualifierName": ["deficiency"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoporosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ovariectomy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14750196", "10.1002/ptr.1347"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
