Pain is a global public health problem with a high impact on life quality and a huge economic implication, becoming one of the most important enemies in modern medicine. The medicinal use of plants as analgesic or antinociceptive drugs in traditional therapy is estimated to be about 80% of the world population. The lamiaceae family, one of the most important herbal families, incorporates a wide variety of plants with biological and medical applications. In this study, the main active compounds of <i>Thymus vulgaris</i> (thymol (51.59%), <i>p</i>-cymene (15.41%), carvacrol (4.52%) and \u03b3-terpinene (12.63%), <i>Salvia officinalis</i>; <i>cis</i>-thujone (38.05%), camphor (16.08%), 1,8-cineole (11.97%), <i>trans</i>-thujone (5.88%), camphene (4.79%), \u03b1 -pinene (4.69%) and carvacrol (50.68%), \u03b3-terpinene (34.44%) and \u03b1-terpinene (3.72%) in <i>Satureja hortensis</i> was determined. The highest EO contents (w/w %) was obtained in the plants of summer savory (2.05%), followed by the garden thyme (1.83%) and common sage (0.55%). It is necessary to identify the most effective compounds in order to extract or synthesise in pure form for future use in the pharmaceutical industry. Also, might be used for isolation of potentially active compounds from some of these medicinal plants in future and formulation of commercial therapeutic agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, Yasuj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammadian Yasuj", "ForeName": "Seyedeh Fariba", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agriculture, Payame Noor University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Najafian", "ForeName": "Sharareh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, Yasuj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseinifarahi", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35837738", "10.1080/14786419.2022.2099390"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
