The purified enzyme has a molecular weight of 120 +/- 3 kDa and is a tetramer of 30 +/- 1.5 kDa. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme revealed the presence of a single isoform with an observed pH optimum of 4.0. 4-Methyl catechol is the best substrate, followed by catechol, and L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, all of which exhibited a phenomenon of inhibition by excess substrate. No activity was detected toward chlorogenic acid, catechin, caffeic acid, gallic acid, and monophenols. Tropolone, both a substrate analogue and metal chelator, proved to be the most effective competitive inhibitor with an apparent K(i) of 5.8 x 10(-)(7) M. Ascorbic acid, metabisulfite, and cysteine were also competitive inhibitors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Protein Chemistry and Technology, Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore 570013, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paul", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gowda", "ForeName": "L R", "Initials": "LR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.10.3.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechol Oxidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catechol Oxidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10995279", "10.1021/jf000296s", "jf000296s"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
