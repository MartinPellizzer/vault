Previous reports have demonstrated the adverse events during clinical application of LHCl, such as liver injury and acute renal failure. The present study aimed to investigate metabolic activation of LHCl to initiate the elucidation of the mechanisms of its liver toxicity. One glutathione (GSH) conjugate was detected in rat and human primary hepatocytes as well as bile of rats after exposure to LHCl. The GSH conjugate was chemically synthesized and characterized by Q-TOF and <sup>1</sup>H NMR. Pretreatment of 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol (DCNP), a broad-spectrum sulfotransferase (SULT) inhibitor, significantly attenuated the formation of the GSH conjugate in LHCl-treated hepatocytes and animals, indicating the participation of SULTs in metabolic activation of LHCl. Moreover, pretreatment with DCNP displayed significant protection against the observed cytotoxicity in rat primary hepatocytes, which suggests a correlation of the bioactivation of LHCl mediated by SULTs with LHCl-induced hepatotoxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110016, P.R.
