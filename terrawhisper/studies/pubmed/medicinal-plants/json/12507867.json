Results revealed that application of paddy straw mulch increased the herb and essential oil yields in geranium by 23% and 27%, respectively, over the unmulched control at planted crop harvest. Corresponding values at regenerated crop harvest were 18.7% and 19.2%. A significant response to N was observed with 160 kgN/ha in mulched plot over the same level of N in the unmulched plot. Using paddy straw mulch, nitrogen uptake by plants of planted and regenerated crops was increased by 33% and 28.4%, respectively, over the unmulched control. Apparent N recoveries by planted and regenerated crops were estimated to be 33.7% and 22.7% for the unmulched control, as against 40% and 29.2% with paddy straw mulch at 160 kgN/ha. The quality of essential oil of geranium in terms of its major constituents, citronellol and geraniol, was not affected by the use of organic mulching and nitrogen fertilization and these constituents were found to be of a standard acceptable in international trade. It was concluded from this study that use of an organic mulch with 160 kgN/ha proved better in terms of economising 80 kgN/ha to produce an economic yield of 96.1 kg geranium oil from two harvests under subtropical conditions of the north Indian plains. At 160 kgN/ha, paddy straw mulch application permitted the geranium crop to produce 18.4 kg/ha more oil which gave an additional return of Rs. 53,600/ha than that of unmulched control. Paddy straw mulch and nitrogen fertilization had no adverse effect on the quality of essential oil of geranium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow 226015, India. m.ram@cimap.res.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ram", "ForeName": "Muni", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ram", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roy", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Bioresour Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9889523", "ISSNLinking": "0960-8524"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pelargonium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Refuse Disposal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tropical Climate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12507867", "10.1016/s0960-8524(02)00232-8", "S0960852402002328"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
