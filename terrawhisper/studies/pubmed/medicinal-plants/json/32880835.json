The genus has complex morphological variations which lead to limits in its precise taxonomic classifications. Genetic diversity study could enhance taxonomic authentication and evolutionary relationship among the species of Clerodendrum. In this study, nine species of Clerodendrum collected from different regions of North East India were screened using ISSR, RAPD, and SCoT molecular markers. The markers of ISSR, RAPD, and SCoT generated a total of 79, 126, and 145 amplicons with an average of 6.58, 7.86, and 8.53 amplicon per primer. The polymorphism information contents (PIC) for ISSR, RAPD, and SCoT ranged from 0.28 to 0.37, 0.39 to 0.69, and 0.30 to 0.62 with resolving power (Rp) varying from 5.26 to 11.11, 4.04 to 9.67, and 4.54 to 8.65, respectively. Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) based clustering methods grouped 94 genotypes into 6 clusters for ISSR and 3 clusters each for RAPD and SCoT markers. Similarly, population structure-based analysis divided 94 genotypes into 6 populations for ISSR and RAPD and 4 populations for SCoT markers. AMOVA analysis revealed that SCoT markers generated maximum genetic variations within and among genotypes, contrary to ISSR and RAPD markers. Results in this study, suggest that the competence of three markers was relatively the same in genotypes fingerprinting, but SCoT was more efficient in the detection of polymorphism for Clerodendrum species. Further, these results could be integrated in the exploration of diverse Clerodendrum species and germplasm utilization."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Aromatic and Economic Plants Group, Biological Sciences & Technology Division (BSTD), CSIR-North East Institute of Science & Technology, Jorhat, 785006, Assam, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Gogoi", "ForeName": "Barbi", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Group, Biological Sciences & Technology Division (BSTD), CSIR-North East Institute of Science & Technology, Jorhat, 785006, Assam, India."}], "LastName": "Wann", "ForeName": "S B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Aromatic and Economic Plants Group, Biological Sciences & Technology Division (BSTD), CSIR-North East Institute of Science & Technology, Jorhat, 785006, Assam, India. spsaikia@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Saikia", "ForeName": "S P", "Initials": "SP"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CSIR-Direct SRF", "Agency": "Council\u00a0of\u00a0Scientific and Industrial Research, India", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mol Biol Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "0403234", "ISSNLinking": "0301-4851"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Clerodendrum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microsatellite Repeats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32880835", "10.1007/s11033-020-05792-x", "10.1007/s11033-020-05792-x"]}}]}
