Breakdown of glucosinolates was catalysed by the endogenous plant enzyme thioglucoside glucohydrolase at neutral and acid pH. Only two unmodified glucosinolates, p-hydroxybenzyl and 2-hydroxybut-3-enyl, significantly induced quinone reductase activity. However, after enzymic hydrolysis at near-neutral pH, some of the glucosinolates yielded breakdown products that significantly induced quinone reductase in the order: 3-methylsulphinylpropyl-->prop-2-enyl-->pent-4-enyl approximately 2-phenylethyl approximately benzyl-->all others tested. Incubation with myrosinase at acidic pH resulted in induction of quinone reductase activity by the hydrolysis products of only three of the tested glucosinolates:3-methylsulphinyl-propyl approximately 2-phenylethyl-->benzyl-->all others, activity due to the two alkenyl compounds being lost. The results show that the potential cancer-blocking action of both intact and thioglucoside glucohydrolase-treated glucosinolates, as assessed by induction of phase II enzyme activity, is dependent on the nature of the side chain of the parent glucosinolate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Molecular Biochemistry Department, Institute of Food Research, Norwich Research Park, Colney, UK."}], "LastName": "Tawfiq", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Heaney", "ForeName": "R K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Plumb", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fenwick", "ForeName": "G R", "Initials": "GR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Musk", "ForeName": "S R", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Williamson", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Carcinogenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8008055", "ISSNLinking": "0143-3334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosinolates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.5.2", "NameOfSubstance": "NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.147", "NameOfSubstance": "thioglucosidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Induction"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosinolates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Mustard Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7767984", "10.1093/carcin/16.5.1191"]}}]}
