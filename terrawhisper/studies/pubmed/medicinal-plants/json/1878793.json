Of the 985 children examined, 38 per cent claimed to use a toothbrush, 31 per cent chewing sticks, 17 per cent plantain and 14 per cent the chewing sponge. In rural areas, traditional methods were preferred, and only 8 per cent used a toothbrush. On examination, oral debris was present in 84 per cent of the sample, and more than three quarters had calculus deposits. Children in urban areas, and particularly those attending private schools, had the cleanest mouths and the lowest periodontal treatment need. Multiple regression analysis showed that the social class background of the child, which reflects motivation and awareness for good oral health, was the most significant predictor for levels of oral cleanliness and CPITN, whereas the method or frequency of cleaning employed were not significant variables."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Child Dental Health, School of Dentistry, University of Leeds, UK."}], "LastName": "Addo-Yobo", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Curzon", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Community Dent Health", "NlmUniqueID": "8411261", "ISSNLinking": "0265-539X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Deposits"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ghana"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Health Services Needs and Demand"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oral Health"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Oral Hygiene"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Periodontal Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Social Class"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Toothbrushing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1878793"]}}]}
