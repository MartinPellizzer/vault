Intravenous injections of matrine at doses from 5 mg to 20 mg/kg body weight exhibited dose-dependent hypotensive and bradycardiac effects. These effects lasted only 1 to 3 min. In the isolated atria and ventricle preparations, matrine at doses from 50 micrograms to 200 micrograms/ml increased the amplitudes of spontaneous contraction of the atria and electrically induced contraction of the ventricle, whereas the frequency of the spontaneous beating of the atria was reduced. The dose-dependent effects of matrine on the isolated preparations persisted as long as the compound was present. Tachyphylaxis was not observed with repeated applications of this compound to the isolated preparations. The positive inotropic effects on both atria and ventricle and the negative chronotropic effect on spontaneous beating of the atria by matrine were not blocked by diphenhydramine, atropine, phenoxybenzamine, propranolol, trifluoperazine, or methysergide. In contrast, verapamil significantly reduced the positive inotropic effect of matrine on the ventricle. In the isolated aortic strip preparation, matrine at a dose of 200 micrograms/ml led to a slight increase in muscle tone. The same dose of matrine induced a 35% increase of perfusion pressure in the hindleg perfusion model. These results suggest that the in vivo transient hypotensive effect of matrine is likely associated with a decrease in heart rate itself, since positive inotropic effects on both the atria and the ventricle, and vasoconstriction of some vascular beds could not be the cause of hypotension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chuang", "ForeName": "C Y", "Initials": "CY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "C F", "Initials": "CF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "P W", "Initials": "PW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China (Republic : 1949- )", "MedlineTA": "Proc Natl Sci Counc Repub China B", "NlmUniqueID": "8502426", "ISSNLinking": "0255-6596"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinolizines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atrial Function"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Atria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Ventricles"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood supply"], "DescriptorName": "Hindlimb"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Isometric Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quinolizines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Regional Blood Flow"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ventricular Function"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Matrines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4070509"]}}]}
