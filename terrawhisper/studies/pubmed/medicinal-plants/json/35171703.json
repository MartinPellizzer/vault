Recombinant IFNs have been approved by regulatory agencies in many countries for clinical treatment of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and other diseases; these IFNs are mainly produced in microorganisms and mammalian cell systems. However, there are serious obstacles to the production of recombinant IFNs in microorganism systems; for example, the recombinant IFN may have different glycosylation patterns from the native protein, be present in insoluble inclusion bodies, be contaminated with impurities such as endotoxins and nucleic acids, have a short half-life in human blood, and incur high production costs. Some medicinal proteins have been successfully expressed in plants and used in clinical applications, suggesting that plants may also be a good system for IFN expression. However, there are still many technical problems that need to be addressed before the clinical application of plant-expressed IFNs, such as increasing the amount of recombinant protein expression and ensuring that the IFN is modified with the correct type of glycosylation. In this article, we review the classification of IFNs, their roles in antiviral signal transduction pathways, their clinical applications, and their expression in plant systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4997-2578"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, China National Tobacco Corporation, Guizhou Academy of Tobacco Science, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Linggai", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, China National Tobacco Corporation, Guizhou Academy of Tobacco Science, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lili", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, China National Tobacco Corporation, Guizhou Academy of Tobacco Science, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiaolian", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, China National Tobacco Corporation, Guizhou Academy of Tobacco Science, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Meng-Ao", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, China National Tobacco Corporation, Guizhou Academy of Tobacco Science, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jishun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jiemin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, China National Tobacco Corporation, Guizhou Academy of Tobacco Science, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Interferon Cytokine Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9507088", "ISSNLinking": "1079-9907"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interferon Type I"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9008-11-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Interferons"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hepacivirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hepatitis C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interferon Type I"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interferons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mammals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "11"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35171703", "10.1089/jir.2021.0148"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
