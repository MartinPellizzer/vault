An HPLC method was used to determine the contents of three alkaloids.", "With HPLC-MS techniques, seven major chromatographic peaks in the fingerprint analysis of Rhizoma Coptidis were identified by their MS spectra and compared with the reference standards. In different cultivation conditions, shading conditions and growing ages have obvious influence on the contents of three alkaloids in Rhizoma Coptidis, while planting density was not the major factor that influenced the contents of three alkaloids. The contents of three alkaloids of Coptidis samples were almost higher than those of Coptidis reference material. For Coptidis samples from different cultivation area, the contents of these three alkaloids were different greatly. For Coptidis samples processed with different methods, the contents of three alkaloids were not influenced obviously by processing methods.", "The results showed that the ecology cultivation method to replace the traditional shading method was feasible and provided the theoretical foundation for scientifically processing Rhizoma Coptidis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materia Media, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sheng", "ForeName": "Yu-Xin", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jin-Lan", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Su-Qin", "Initials": "SQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jin-Tang", "Initials": "JT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "091S1F8V5Q", "NameOfSubstance": "jatrorrhizine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0I8Y3P32UF", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G50C034217", "NameOfSubstance": "palmatine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Coptis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17184122"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
