Although challenging, the synthesis of Fe-N-C catalysts with highly dispersed and fully exposed active sites is of critical importance for improving the ORR activity. Here, we report a new type of graphitic Fe-N-C catalysts featuring numerous Fe single atoms anchored on a three-dimensional simple-cubic carbon framework. The Fe-N-C catalyst, derived from self-assembled Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanocube superlattices, was prepared by in situ ligand carbonization followed by acid etching and ammonia activation. Benefiting from its homogeneously dispersed and fully accessible active sites, highly graphitic nature, and enhanced mass transport, our Fe-N-C catalyst outperformed Pt/C and many previously reported Fe-N-C catalysts for ORR. Furthermore, when used for constructing the cathode for zinc-air batteries, our Fe-N-C catalyst exhibited current and power densities comparable to those of the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Molecular Catalysis and Innovative Materials, and Department of Chemistry, Fudan University , Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Biwei", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Functional Nano and Soft Materials (FUNSOM), Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Carbon-Based Functional Materials and Devices, Soochow University , Suzhou 215123, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xinxia", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Molecular Catalysis and Innovative Materials, and Department of Chemistry, Fudan University , Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Jinxiang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Molecular Catalysis and Innovative Materials, and Department of Chemistry, Fudan University , Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Yancui", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Molecular Catalysis and Innovative Materials, and Department of Chemistry, Fudan University , Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Songhai", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, The Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Urumqi 830011, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Guangzhi", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0506-0451"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Functional Nano and Soft Materials (FUNSOM), Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Carbon-Based Functional Materials and Devices, Soochow University , Suzhou 215123, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yanguang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9677-8778"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Molecular Catalysis and Innovative Materials, and Department of Chemistry, Fudan University , Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Angang", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nano Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "101088070", "ISSNLinking": "1530-6984"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28128964", "10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b00004"]}}]}
