Brazil ranks seventh-largest producer, with 66,000 tons produced in 2018. Buckwheat is also valued for its adaptability as a cover crop, in grain fields of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i> (L.) Merr., maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.), and sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i> (L.) Moench) (G\u00f6rgen et al. 2016, Babu et al. 2018) especially in fields highly infested with plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN). PPN cause severe root damage, suppressing plant development and yield production. In October 2018, six samples of roots and soil were collected in symptomatic patches of buckwheat, in Gua\u00edra SP (20\u00b0 19' 32\"S 48\u00b0 13' 15.4\"W). Samples were analyzed in the Nematology Laboratory (LabNema), UNESP, Jaboticabal, SP, BR. Plants presented symptoms of yellow leaves and galled and volume-reduced roots. <i>Meloidogyne</i> sp. was found, comprising 6,320 eggs and second-stage juveniles (J2s) from 10 g of root and 1,628 J2s in 100 cm\u00b3 of soil. Adult morphological characteristics, isoenzyme phenotype of esterase, and molecular analysis were performed to identify the <i>Meloidogyne</i> species. The perineal patterns presented high and trapezoidal dorsal arch (n=15), and the males showed a trapezoidal labial region, including a high head cap formed by a large round labial disc that is raised above the medial lips and centrally concave (n=15) (Eisenback and Hirscmann 1981). These characteristics are typical in <i>Meloidogyne incognita</i> (Kofoid and White, 1912) Chitwood, 1949 (Nascimento et al., 2020; Eisenback and Hirschmann 1981; Netscher and Taylor 1974). The enzymatic phenotype was performed with females (n=8), and the phenotype I1 was verified, described by Esbenshade and Triantaphyllou (1985) as typical for <i>M. incognita</i>. To confirm the species DNA samples were extracted from individual females (n=6) and PCR with specific primers for <i>M. incognita</i> (<i>Mi</i>-F 5'- GTGAGGATTCAGCTCCCCAG-3' and <i>Mi</i>-R 5'-ACGAGGAA CATACTTCTCCGTCC-3') and <i>M. javanica</i> (Treub) Chitwood 1949 (Fjav 5'-GGTGCGCGATTGAACTGAGC-3' and Rjav 5'-CAG GCCCTTCAGTGGAACTATAC-3') that amplify SCAR markers described by Meng et al. (2004) and Zijlstra et al. (2000), respectively, and specific primers for <i>M. enterolobii</i> Yang & Eisenback 1983 that amplify rDNA-IGS2 region (<i>Me</i>-F 5'-AACTTTTG TGAAAGTGCCGCTG-3' and <i>Me</i>-R 5'-TCAGTTCAGGCAGG ATCAACC-3') described by Long et al. (2006) were tested. A fragment of 955 pb DNA size was amplified in <i>Mi</i>-F/R primer, which confirmed the <i>M. incognita</i> identification (Meng et. al., 2004). The original population was used to execute pathogenicity test. In a greenhouse, single buckwheat seeds (cv. IPR 91 Baili) were sown in six 5L pots filled with autoclaved-soil and inoculated with 3,000 eggs and J2s per pot (n=6) and control (n=6). After 60 days, the nematodes were extracted from roots and the <i>M. incognita</i> was confirmed. An average of 15,738 eggs and J2s were recovered, (reproductive factor = 5.24), which confirmed buckwheat as a host to <i>M. incognita</i>. The inoculated plants showed symptoms as those observed in the field. No symptom or nematode was noted on the control. <i>Meloidogyne incognita</i> has been reported causing high damage to the <i>F. esculentum</i> in California (Gardner and Caswell-Chen 1994) plus several crops in Brazil (Nascimento et al., 2020). However, this is the first report of this nematode infecting buckwheat in Brazil. Given the importance of buckwheat in Brazil, with extensive use as forage, cover crop, and its nutritional properties, this report is essential to specific management measures are adopted to avoid further losses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidade Estadual Paulista Julio de Mesquita Filho Faculdade de Ciencias Agrarias e Veterinarias Campus de Jaboticabal, 153993, Department of Plant Health, Jaboticabal, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; jrferreirafcav.unesp@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Ferreira", "ForeName": "Rivanildo Junior", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidade Estadual Paulista Julio de Mesquita Filho Faculdade de Ciencias Agrarias e Veterinarias Campus de Jaboticabal, 153993, Departamento de Ci\u00eancias da Produ\u00e7\u00e3o Agr\u00edcola, Via de Acesso Prof.Paulo Donato Castellane, Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil, 14884-900; edicleide.c.c@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "Edicleide Macedo da", "Initials": "EMD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sao Paulo State University Julio de Mesquita Filho Jaboticabal Campus Faculty of Agrarian and Veterinary Sciences, 153993, Department of Plant Health, Via de Acesso Prof. Paulo Donato Castellane s/n, Jaboticabal, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, 14884-900; dalvan.nascimento@unesp.br."}], "LastName": "Nascimento", "ForeName": "Daniel Dalvan", "Initials": "DD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidade Estadual Paulista J\u00falio de Mesquita Filho C\u00e2mpus de Jaboticabal Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias Agr\u00e1rias e Veterin\u00e1rias, 153993, Departamento de Ci\u00eancias da Produ\u00e7\u00e3o Agr\u00edcola, Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil; leticiabernabe.s@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Santos", "ForeName": "Let\u00edcia Bernab\u00e9", "Initials": "LB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidade Estadual Paulista Julio de Mesquita Filho Faculdade de Ciencias Agrarias e Veterinarias Campus de Jaboticabal, 153993, Departamento de Ci\u00eancias da Produ\u00e7\u00e3o Agr\u00edcola, Via de Acesso Prof.Paulo Donato Castellane s/n, Jaboticabal, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, 14884-900; vitor.trigo@unesp.br."}], "LastName": "Trigo", "ForeName": "Vitor Alves", "Initials": "VA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aguetoni Agr\u00edcola Ltda, Gua\u00edra, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; gabripnog@yahoo.com.br."}], "LastName": "Nogueira", "ForeName": "Gabriel Pereira", "Initials": "GP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "UNESP, 28108, Ci\u00eancias da Produ\u00e7\u00e3o Agr\u00edcola, Rua Nelson Brihi Badur, 430, Registro, SP, Brazil, 11900-000; pablo.vargas@unesp.br."}], "LastName": "Vargas", "ForeName": "Pablo Forlan", "Initials": "PF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto Biologico, 245146, Sao Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; ricardo.harakava@sp.gov.br."}], "LastName": "Harakava", "ForeName": "Ricardo", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sao Paulo State University Julio de Mesquita Filho - Jaboticabal Campus, 207340, Department of Agricultural Sciences, Via de Acesso Prof. Paulo Donato Castellane, s/n, Unesp.
