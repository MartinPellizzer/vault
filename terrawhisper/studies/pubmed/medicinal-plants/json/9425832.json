Various biological activities of adult stage as well as the amino acids of the treated adults ovaries were determined. Amino acids determinations were achieved on newly emerged flies and on the three and four days old flies. The LD50s. of 76 and 84 ug/fly of the two oils were used for Matricaria chamomilla and Clerodendron inerme oil, respectively. Treatment with the two volatile oils induced serious effects on the biology and biotic potential of Musca domestica. Treatment was significantly increased the acidic and the aromatic amino acids during oogenesis. In contrast the quantity of aliphatic amino acids was significantly decreased while the hydroxy amino acids have inconsistent results. The hydroxy amino acids were remarkably increased in the ovaries during three days of development, and then decreased in the fourth day. Moreover, the concentration of basic and the sulfur amino acids were varied with the two treatments and the amino acid was completely disappeared in the ovaries of the treated flies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Zagazig University, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Shoukry", "ForeName": "I F", "Initials": "IF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Egypt", "MedlineTA": "J Egypt Soc Parasitol", "NlmUniqueID": "8102141", "ISSNLinking": "1110-0583"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chamomile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Houseflies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lethal Dose 50"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ovary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9425832"]}}]}
