The active plant materials were fractionated using different organic solvents, including n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol. Bioassay-guided fractionation and column chromatography were used to isolate compounds. The compounds structures were elucidated by analysis of spectroscopic data, including IR, MS, and NMR.", "Three hundreds and eleven methanol extracts (CME) belonging to 301 Vietnamese herbs were screened for XO inhibitory activity. Among these plants, 57 extracts displayed XO inhibitory activity at 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL with inhibition rates of over 50%. The extracts of Archidendron clypearia (A.\u00a0clypearia), Smilax poilanei, Linociera ramiflora and Passiflora foetida exhibited the greatest potency with IC<sub>50</sub> values below 30\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Chemical study performed on the extract of A. clypearia resulted in the isolation of six compounds, including 1-octacosanol, docosenoic acid, daucosterol, methyl gallate, quercitrin and (-)-7-O-galloyltricetiflavan. The compound (-)-7-O-galloyltricetiflavan showed the most potent XO inhibitory activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 25.5\u00a0\u03bcmol/L.", "From this investigation, four Vietnamese medicinal plants were identified to have XO inhibitory effects with IC<sub>50</sub> values of the methanol extracts below 30\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Compound (-)-7-O- galloyltricetiflavan was identified as an XO inhibitor from A. clypearia with IC<sub>50</sub> value of 25.5\u00a0\u03bcmol/L."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Hainan Medical University.
