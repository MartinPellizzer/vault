The present study is an evaluation of the anti-oxidative and antihyperlipidemic effects of the hydroalcoholic extract of <i>Rhus coriaria L.</i> (HARE) in rats on a high-fat diet (HFD). Twenty male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control, HFD, HFD\u2009+\u2009HARE 50\u2009mg/kg/day, and HFD\u2009+\u2009HARE 250\u2009mg/kg/day for 12\u00a0weeks. Animals were weighed weekly and treated with the HARE extract for 12\u00a0weeks by gavage. Subsequently, the histopathological changes, oxidative markers, and lipid profile were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiple comparisons. First, the active ingredients of the extract were determined by HPLC. Then, the levels in the serum lipid profile (TG, cholesterol, HDL, and LDL) in rats fed with the HFD\u2009+\u2009HARE were analyzed where a significant reduction was observed. The HFD proved to increase the activity of the liver enzymes, the serum lipid levels, and the malondialdehyde (MDA) level. The ferric-reducing antioxidant activity power (FRAP), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) catalytic activity were reduced in the liver homogenate of HFD rats compared to the controls. Additionally, the aforementioned liver enzymes activities were reduced in response to HARE. Evaluation of oxidative stress determined a reduction in the MDA level while a raised FRAP was confirmed. In accordance with the present results, histopathological observations have also demonstrated that HARE ameliorated grade-1 hepatic steatosis induced by HFD. Taken together, the findings of this study introduce HARE as a future potential therapeutic agent in treating hepatic steatosis and reducing oxidative damages of an HFD in the liver."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaeni Pasavei", "ForeName": "Abdolmomen", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohebbati", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jalili-Nik", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nosrati Tirkani", "ForeName": "Abolfazl", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Taraz Jamshidi", "ForeName": "Shirin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hashemy", "ForeName": "Seyed Isaac", "Initials": "SI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Heidarian Miri", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soukhtanloo", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet, High-Fat"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Dyslipidemias"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "etiology", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "39"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33319629", "10.1080/01480545.2018.1533024"]}}]}
