In addition, they could also be used as a traditional Chinese medicinal and modern medicinal plant (Du et al. 2014). In August 2019, a leaf spot disease was observed on H. citrina plants in Zhejiang Province of China, with approximately 85% incidence in almost 700 ha. Symptoms were firstly displayed as small, water-soaked, pale chlorotic spots, with yellow halos enlarged into large fusiform spots with brown edge and gray centers. Later, infected leaves were badly damaged and became wilted. Small pieces of infected tissue were excised from the margin of necrotic lesions, surface disinfected with 70% ethanol for 8s, 0.1% HgCl2 for 1 min, rinsed with sterile distilled water for three times, and incubated on potato dextrose agar (PDA, amended with 100 mg/L streptomycin sulfate) at 26\u00b0C in the dark. Fungal colonies with similar cultural morphology were consistently obtained from repeated isolations. When cultured on PDA, colonies were villose, regular, grayish-green, and turned gray-brown, with the reverse side became reddish-brown. Chlamydospores were gray, unicellular or multicellular, nearly spherical, 11 to 27 \u00d7 10 to 23 \u03bcm. Pycnidia and conidia were produced on PDA when the fungal colonies were exposed to ultraviolet light for 12 h with a distance of 40 cm to the late source. Pycnidia were brown, mostly spheroid, and measured 90 to 138 \u00d7 120 to 210 \u03bcm. Conidia were hyaline, ellipsoidal, unicellular, aseptate, 4.3 to 5.5 \u00d7 1.8 to 2.4 \u03bcm. These morphological characteristics agreed with the descriptions of Epicoccum sorghinum (Zhou et al. 2018). The DNA of a representative strain HHC6-2 was extracted using CTAB method and the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS), actin (ACT) and \u03b2-tubulin (TUB) genes were amplified and sequenced, using the primers ITS4/ITS5 (White et al. 1990), ACT512F/ACT783R (Carbone and Kohn 1999) and Bt-1/Bt-2 (Glass and Donaldson 1995), respectively. BLASTn searches of the resulting ITS, ACT and TUB sequences (accession nos. MW073403, MW080522, MW080521) revealed 98.58 to 100% identity to the E. sorghinum sequences (MT125854, MN956831 and MF987525). The pathogenicity test was carried out by inoculation of potted H. citrina plants using conidial suspensions. H. citrina seedlings were planted in pots with sterilized soil. Before inoculation, leaves were surface-disinfected with 70% ethanol and sterile distilled water. Leaves were inoculated by placing small droplets of conidial suspensions (105 conidia/ml) on one side of the midvein, and 3 to 5 drops were used per leaf. Sterile water was used as control. All the inoculated plants were placed in humid chambers at 25\u00b0C for 48h, and then maintained in a greenhouse at 25\u00b0C with a 16 h day-8 h night cycle. The pathogenicity assays were performed twice with three replications. Four days after inoculation, yellow to brown spots resembling those observed in the fields developed on the inoculated leaves. However, no symptoms were observed on the controls. E. sorghinum was re-isolated and identified based on morphological and molecular techniques as described above. To our knowledge, this is the first report of E. sorghinum causing leaf spot on H. citrina. It seems to be a threat for H. citrina planting in China and should be considered in order to reduce losses caused by this disease. This study might provide the basis for diagnosis and control of the disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinyun Plant protective station, Changsha, China; 472136668@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Ya-Ming", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lishui Cash crop station, Lishui, China; 45623243@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jin Lian", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changsha, China; 1373961913@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Zhao", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Biology and Control of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests, Hunan Agricultural University, plant pathology, Changsha, China; 1601389330@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Biology and Control of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests, Hunan Agricultural University, Nongda Road 1, Furong District, Changsha City, Hunan Province, Changsha, China; 442118535@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jun Zi", "Initials": "JZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["33630682", "10.1094/PDIS-10-20-2144-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
