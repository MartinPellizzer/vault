Its sequence was determined on both strands. Southern blot analysis of EcoRI-digested Texas bluebonnet DNA revealed clone hybridization throughout the approximately 1.0 to > 23 kb size range; the darkest hybridization was in the high molecular weight range (approximately 6 to > 23 kb). Using dot blot analysis, the copy number of the 654-bp clone was estimated to be approximately 4.75 x 10(4) copies per haploid genome, and thus this repetitive sequence comprises 3.5-4.1% of the nuclear genome. Sequence analyses showed that this clone contains multiple repeats: mainly the ATTGG pentamer, but also derivative pentamers (e.g., GTTGG, TTTGG, ATAGG, and GGATT). Examination of DNA base occurrence revealed a strand bias in base composition. Data-base searches using the algorithm FASTA revealed no alignment with existing plant data base sequences, but showed sequence identity with several telomeric and satellite DNA sequences. The two highest-scoring alignments were with another pentamer-containing sequence from a telomeric region of the nematode Parascaris univalens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Missouri-St. Louis 63121, USA.
