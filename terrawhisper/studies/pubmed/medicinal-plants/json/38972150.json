Various studies have demonstrated that the activation or upregulation of Silent Information Regulation 2 homolog 2 (SIRT2) exerts inhibitory effect on the expression of NLRP3. Although 1,8-cineole has been found to protect against endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular diseases, its role and mechanism in diabetic angiopathy remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the ameliorative effect of 1,8-cineole through SIRT2 on pyroptosis associated with diabetic angiopathy in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. The findings revealed that 1,8-cineole exhibited a protective effect against vascular injury and ameliorated pathological alterations in the thoracic aorta of diabetic mice. Moreover, it effectively mitigated pyroptosis induced by palmitic acid-high glucose (PA-HG) in HUVECs. Treatment with 1,8-cineole effectively restored the reduced levels of SIRT2 and suppressed the elevated expression of pyroptosis-associated proteins. Additionally, our findings demonstrated the occurrence of NLRP3 deacetylation and the physical interaction between NLRP3 and SIRT2. The SIRT2 inhibitor AGK2 and siRNA-SIRT2 effectively attenuated the effect of 1,8-cineole on NLRP3 deacetylation in HUVECs and compromised its inhibitory effect against pyroptosis in HUVECs. However, overexpression of SIRT2 inhibited PA-HG-induced pyroptosis in HUVECs. 1,8-Cineole inhibited the deacetylation of NLRP3 by regulating SIRT2, thereby reducing pyroptosis in HUVECs. In conclusion, our findings suggest that PA-HG-induced pyroptosis in HUVECs plays a crucial role in the development of diabetic angiopathy, which can be mitigated by 1,8-cineole."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
