It is derived from stems of various Dendrobium plants and has the functions of nourishing Yin and clearing heat, activating water and nourishing the stomach, moistening the lung and relieving cough. Modern phytochemical studies show that the main components of Dendrobium include alkaloids, polysaccharides, terpenoids, diphenylbenzene, and phenanthrene. Alkaloids are natural products with obvious biological activity and are important effective components of the medicinal activity or toxicity of plants. At present, dozens of alkaloids with various structures have been isolated from Dendrobium plants, and the alkaloid contents in Dendrobium plants of different species are quite different. From the perspective of food safety, the type, molecular structure, content and potential physiological activity or toxicity of alkaloids are important bases for evaluating the safety of edible plants. Studies have shown that the alkaloids isolated from Dendrobium have neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities, showing that these alkaloids with potential medicinal activity are important sources of lead compounds in innovative drug development.", "To summarize the research progress on alkaloids in Dendrobium and provide a reference for research on the food safety and medicinal development of Dendrobium.", "Information about alkaloids from Dendrobium was collected from the scientific databases Web of Science, PubChem and PubMed. We discuss the biosynthetic pathway, biological activities and total synthesis of alkaloids from Dendrobium from 1964 to 2020 and summarize the knowledge of alkaloids from Dendrobium, the biosynthetic pathway, biological activities and total synthesis. We chose publications on their chemistry, drug effects, pharmacology, metabolism and biosynthesis, physiology and toxicity. Alkaloids, Dendrobium, biosynthetic pathway and biological activities were used as keywords to extract the relevant literature.", "In this paper, the structural classification, biological activity, target and toxicology and synthesis of the alkaloids in Dendrobium were systematically reviewed, which will provide a reference for the safety, development and application of Dendrobium."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier GmbH.
