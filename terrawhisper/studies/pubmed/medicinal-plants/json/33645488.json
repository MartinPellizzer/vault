Recently, with the discovery of exosomes, researchers have implemented new approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of various malignancies such as lung cancer. Investigation of lung cancer cell-derived exosomes and analysis of their profile by advanced techniques will assist researchers to take advantage of the specific properties of these multivesicular bodies. Also, scientists have presented various encouraging methods in the treatment of lung cancer with loading drugs, proteins, microRNAs, and siRNAs inside specific antigen-targeted exosomes. This review discusses the role of exosomes as novel prognostic biomarkers (containing lipids, surface and internal proteins, miRNAs, and lncRNAs) and therapeutic agents (e.g. vaccine and targeted drug delivery systems) in lung cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran | Cellular and Molecular Biology Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammadi", "ForeName": "Rezvan", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran | Department of Medical Biotechnology and Nanotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Seyede A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran | Department of Medical Biotechnology and Nanotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Noruzi", "ForeName": "Somaye", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran | Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Science, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ebrahimzadeh", "ForeName": "Ailin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran | Applied Biomedical Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran | School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sahebkar", "ForeName": "Amirhossein", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101265649", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers, Tumor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Carriers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Carriers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Exosomes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "55"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33645488", "10.2174/1871520621666210301085318", "ACAMC-EPUB-114593"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
