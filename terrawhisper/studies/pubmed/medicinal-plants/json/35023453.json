As per Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS), one of the main concerns is low solubility and/or permeation of drugs resulting in reduced absorption and poor bioavailability. To overcome these issues, various strategies have been adopted, including the use of permeation enhancers which are also known as bioenhancers. Bioenhancers are synthetic or natural compounds that increase the bioavailability of drugs and nutrients such as vitamins, amino acids, minerals, etc., into the systemic circulation and at the site of action for exhibiting improved therapeutic action. By improving bioavailability, bioenhancers can reduce drug dose, decrease the treatment period, and circumvent the problem of drug resistance. Although numerous studies have reported the application of synthetic bioenhancers, plant based bioenhancers can serve as a better alternative owing to their natural origin. Literature reviews have revealed that plant-based bioenhancers have been used in a wide variety of antibiotics, antiviral, and anti-cancer therapeutics. These can be categorized based on their sources and mechanism of action. This review will provide a systematic and detailed overview of the various plant based bioenhancers and their applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Pharmacy, Amity University, Sector 125, Noida, Uttar Pradesh - 201313, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology, University of Colorado - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Sweta", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Pharmacy, Amity University, Sector 125, Noida, Uttar Pradesh - 201313, India."}], "LastName": "Chopra", "ForeName": "Shruti", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technology, Maharaja Ranjit Singh Punjab Technical University, Bathinda, Punjab - 151001, India."}], "LastName": "Chaurasia", "ForeName": "Simran", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Pharmacy, Amity University, Sector 125, Noida, Uttar Pradesh - 201313, India."}], "LastName": "Sarwat", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "44"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35023453", "10.2174/1381612828666220112141355", "CPD-EPUB-120133"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
