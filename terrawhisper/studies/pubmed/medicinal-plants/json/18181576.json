This study examines the early signaling effects of [6]-gingerol on renal cells. It was found that [6]-gingerol caused a slow and sustained rise of [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner. [6]-gingerol also induced a [Ca2+]i rise when extracellular Ca2+ was removed, but the magnitude was reduced by 80%. Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with CCCP, a mitochondrial uncoupler, did not affect the action of [6]-gingerol. In a Ca2+-free medium, the [6]-gingerol-induced [Ca2+]i rise was partially abolished by depleting stored Ca2+ with thapsigargin (an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump inhibitor). The elevation of [6]-gingerol-caused [Ca2+]i in a Ca2+-containing medium was not affected by modulation of protein kinase C activity. The [6]-gingerol-induced Ca2+ influx was blocked by nicardipine. U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C, abolished ATP (but not [6]-gingerol)-induced [Ca2+]i rise. These findings suggest that [6]-gingerol induces a significant rise in [Ca2+]i in MDCK renal tubular cells by stimulating both extracellular Ca2+ influx and thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ release via as yet unidentified mechanisms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Medical Technology, Fooyin University, Kaohsiung County, Taiwan, Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chung-Yi", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ching-Hsein", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kung", "ForeName": "Chiu-Hu", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuo", "ForeName": "Shih-Hsing", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuo", "ForeName": "Soong-Yu", "Initials": "SY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Alcohols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "67526-95-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Thapsigargin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "925QK2Z900", "NameOfSubstance": "gingerol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CZ5312222S", "NameOfSubstance": "Nicardipine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Signaling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catechols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Alcohols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zingiber officinale"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nicardipine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Thapsigargin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18181576", "10.1021/np070279y"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
