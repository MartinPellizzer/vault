Cusson which has been long used in China as a herbal medicine to improve male sexual dysfunction.", "Strips of rabbit corpus cavernosum were precontracted with phenylephrine. Corporal relaxation evoked by osthole was then determined in the absence and presence of nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME), soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor (ODQ), cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin), tetradotoxin, and after endothelium deprivation.", "Corpus cavernosal strips showed relaxation in response to osthole (0.1 approximately 30 microM) in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were reduced partially but significantly by pretreatment with L-NAME, ODQ and by endothelial disruption. However, they were not affected by indomethacin and tetradotoxin treatment. Osthole pretreatment (from 1 to 30 microM) enhanced the sodium nitroprusside (0.3 microM)-induced relaxation of corpus cavernosum in a dose-dependent manner to a maximum of 3 times the pretreatment level at 30 microM osthole. However, this effect was abolished in the presence of zaprinast. Additionally, a higher concentration of osthole (30 microM) also enhanced forskolin-induced relaxation.", "The data suggested that osthole possesses a relaxant effect on rabbit corpus cavernosal tissues which is attributable to the release of NO from sinusoidal endothelium and to the potentiation of the cGMP and/or cAMP signal mediating relaxation of cavernosal smooth muscle by inhibiting phosphodiesterase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, and National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiou", "ForeName": "W F", "Initials": "WF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "C F", "Initials": "CF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Urol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376374", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5347"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.6.1.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Guanylate Cyclase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V55S2QJN2X", "NameOfSubstance": "NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XH1TI1759C", "NameOfSubstance": "osthol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XXE1CET956", "NameOfSubstance": "Indomethacin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Guanylate Cyclase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indomethacin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Relaxation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Smooth"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10799242", "S0022-5347(05)67613-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
