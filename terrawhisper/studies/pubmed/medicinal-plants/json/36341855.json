The chemical structures of the undescribed compounds were characterized by spectroscopic data interpretation, including NMR (<sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR HSQC and HMBC) and HRESIMS analysis. CD data analysis was conducted to assign the absolute configurations of the undescribed compounds and the active compound verniciflavanol A was also confirmed by ECD experiment. The absolute configuration of the sugar moiety was identified by GC analysis of chiral derivatives in the hydrolysate. MTT assay was applied to test these compounds against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Results found that verniciflavanol A demonstrated the best potential in protecting SH-SY5Y cells against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress by inhibiting cell apoptosis and attenuate reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and mitochondrial dysfunction. And the underlying mechanism was confirmed to be associated with Nrf2-antioxidant response element signaling and IL-6\u00a0cell survival pathways."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
