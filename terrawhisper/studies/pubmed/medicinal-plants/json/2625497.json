Initial rationale for addition of 2-ethoxyethanol was to minimize inhibitory effects of decalin on filtration and to facilitate starch solubilization. Decalin is no longer recommended in the procedure; alpha-amylase is commonly used to facilitate starch solubilization. Objectives of this study were to evaluate effects on NDF values of: 1) eliminating 2-ethoxyethanol from the procedure and 2) addition of and timing of addition of alpha-amylase. Deletion of 2-ethoxyethanol resulted in lower NDF values than neutral detergent solution with 2-ethoxyethanol (61.95 and 62.06%, respectively). Neutral detergent fiber values were lower for samples treated with alpha-amylase just prior to filtration (61.86%) than for samples not treated with alpha-amylase (62.13%). Addition of alpha-amylase 30 min after onset of boiling resulted in lower values (62.07%) than with no alpha-amylase addition (62.29%) in solutions containing 2-ethoxyethanol but not in solutions without 2-ethoxyethanol. Observed treatment differences were small, however, and probably not of practical significance. No differences in NDF values were noted due to timing of alpha-amylase addition. Inclusion of samples requiring alpha-amylase to filter increased overall mean CV and resulted in no statistical differences between neutral detergent solutions or alpha-amylase treatments. Suggested modifications to the NDF procedure include elimination of 2-ethoxyethanol and addition of alpha-amylase just prior to filtering."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907."}], "LastName": "Cherney", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Patterson", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cherney", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Dairy Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "2985126R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Amylases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IDK7C2HS09", "NameOfSubstance": "2-ethoxyethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Amylases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2625497", "10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(89)79461-3", "S0022-0302(89)79461-3"]}}]}
