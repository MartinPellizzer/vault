Metabolic syndromes are managed with changes in diet, exercise, lifestyle modifications and the use of pharmacological agents. Plants are now known to have potent antioxidant and cholinergic activities which are relevant to the management of several metabolic syndromes, which are unfortunately, co-morbidity factors in the coronavirus disease crisis. This review will focus on the biological activities of some plant products used as complementary and alternative medicines in the management of metabolic syndromes, and on their reported antiviral, antithrombotic, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory properties, which are integral to their usage in the management of viral infections and may give an avenue for prophylactic and therapeutics especially in the absence of vaccines/formulated antiviral therapies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7616-9468"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Nna", "ForeName": "Victor Udo", "Initials": "VU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The University of the West Indies, Mona, Jamaica."}], "LastName": "McGrowder", "ForeName": "Donovan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7092-9382"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Medical Sciences (Physiology Section), The University of the West Indies, Mona, Jamaica."}], "LastName": "Nwokocha", "ForeName": "Chukwuemeka", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Arch Physiol Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9510153", "ISSNLinking": "1381-3455"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "8"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33770443", "10.1080/13813455.2021.1903041"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
