Dexamethasone was chosen as the positive drug. The administration of different drugs started from day 1 and continued for 28 days. Paw swelling, arthritis score and histopathological changes were examined to assess the severity of arthritis. In addition, the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expressions in joint synovial tissues were detected.", "GMI reduced paw edema, arthritis scores and the index of spleen and thymus from day 7 to 21 after CIA compared with those in the CIA group. Our data also demonstrated that GMI inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, regulated the expression of iNOS and COX-2 compared with those in the CIA group. We also obtained four major components from GMI, identified as loganic acid, swertamarin, gentiopicroside and sweroside, and the contents of them were also calculated respectively.", "Taken together, our results shed light on the therapeutic efficacy of GMI in rats rheumatoid arthritis model by reducing the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in serum as well as down-regulating the levels of iNOS and COX-2. Therefore, GMI may be an effective therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
