Other species with similar thorny leaves have raised great confusion in order to discern the authentic <i>M. ilicifolia</i>. Misidentifications can lead to product adulteration of authentic <i>M. ilicifolia</i> with other species, which can be found on the Brazilian market. The intake of misclassified herbal products potentially could be fatal, demanding faster reliable fingerprinting-based classification methods. In this study, the use of <sup>1</sup>H HR-MAS NMR metabolomics fingerprinting and principal component analysis (PCA) allowed an evaluation of the authenticity for both collected and commercial <i>M. ilicifolia</i> samples, from the content of the flavanol, (-)-epicatechin (<b>2</b>), by observing variations in metabolic patterns. Plant specimen types from cultivated and natural habitats were analyzed by considering seasonal and topological differences. The interand intraplant topological metabolic profiles were found to be affected by seasonal and/or ecological trends such as sunlight, shade, rain, and the presence of pathogens. Moreover, several commercial samples, labeled as <i>M. ilicifolia</i>, were evaluated, but most of these products were of an inadequate quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4604-9702"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NMR Center, Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Paran\u00e1, Curitiba, PR 81530-900, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Sher", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NMR Center, Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Paran\u00e1, Curitiba, PR 81530-900, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Rech", "ForeName": "Katlin S", "Initials": "KS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NMR Center, Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Paran\u00e1, Curitiba, PR 81530-900, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Badshah", "ForeName": "Gul", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NMR Center, Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Paran\u00e1, Curitiba, PR 81530-900, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Soares", "ForeName": "Frederico L F", "Initials": "FLF"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9381-8239"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NMR Center, Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Paran\u00e1, Curitiba, PR 81530-900, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Barison", "ForeName": "Andersson", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "8R1V1STN48", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Catechin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Maytenus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolome"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34110831", "10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c01094"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
