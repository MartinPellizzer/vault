Many synthetic based products of phenolics and flavonoids have been used, however the demand of eco-friendly, natural herbal based products are increasing. As a result, the current study aims to explore traditional potential of Polygonum posumbu related to its phenolics and flavonoids. Optimization of extraction parameters were employed which includes: solvent selection (water, ethanol, methanol, acetone and ethyl acetate), ethanol composition (40-100%), solvent to sample ratio (30-70\u00a0ml/g), temperature (50-80\u00a0\u00b0C) and time (1-5\u00a0h). Under optimal conditions, total phenolics (TPC), total flavonoids (TFC), the extract yield (EY) and antioxidant activities of leaves extract were 162.79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.28\u00a0mg GAE/g, 56.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.22\u00a0mg QE/g 27.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.91%, and 27.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.98\u00a0\u03bcg/ml respectively. Seven flavonoids were quantified in different tissues with significant (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) differences found in flavonoids contents in different parts of the plant. Highest concentration of flavonoids was observed in stems: (-)-epicatechin-53.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.13\u00a0mg/g, myricetin-15.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13\u00a0mg/g, quercetin-50.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08\u00a0mg/g, luteolin-43.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.47\u00a0mg/g, apigenin-16.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.43\u00a0mg/g. Leaves and roots had the highest amount of genistein (05.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0mg/g) and kaempferol (11.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\u00a0mg/g) respectively. From the study it had been found that Polygonum posumbu possess a very good amount of phenolics and flavonoids and this study details first ever investigation on this plant in terms of phenolics and flavonoids. Therefore, this study enhanced the importance of this bioresource in functional food or nutraceutical industries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
