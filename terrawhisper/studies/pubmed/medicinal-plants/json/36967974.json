The biosynthesized OSE-AgNPs were also assessed for its catalytic, antibacterial, anti-diabetic, antioxidant and dye degradation properties. The techniques like UV-visible spectroscopic examinations, TEM, SEM, TGA, zeta potential and FT-IR were used in the characterization investigations. The bioproduction of OSE-AgNPs was preliminary confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopic based investigation followed by microscopic visualization. The synthesized OSE-AgNPs exhibited a reddish brown colour and nearly spherical forms with sizes between 5 and 50\u00a0nm quantified by TEM and SEM. The attendance of functional groups like -OH and -NH present in OSE caps on the AgNPs surface was confirmed by FTIR analysis. Interestingly, in the presence of OSE-AgNPs, the degradation of dyes (CV, 95% and EY, 96% in 15\u00a0min) were noticeably accelerated. Further, OSE-AgNPs demonstrated substantial antibacterial activity; robust antioxidant properties andnotable anti-diabetic activities.
