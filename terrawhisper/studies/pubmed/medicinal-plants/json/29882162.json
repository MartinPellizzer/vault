These nanoparticles can be synthesized using a variety of different physical, chemical, and biological techniques. The biological means are largely preferred as it provides an environmentally benign, green, and cost-effective route for the biosynthesis of nanoparticles. These bioresources can act as a scaffold, thereby playing the role of reducing as well as capping agents in the biosynthesis of nanoparticles. Medicinal plants tend to have a complex phytochemical constituent such as alcohols, phenols, terpenes, alkaloids, saponins, and proteins, while microbes have key enzymes which can act as reducing as well as stabilizing agent for NP synthesis. However, the mechanism of biosynthesis is still highly debatable. Herein, the present review is directed to give an updated comprehensive overview towards the mechanistic aspects in the biosynthesis of nanoparticles via plants and microbes. Various biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites in plants and key enzyme production in microbes have been discussed in detail, along with the underlying mechanisms for biogenic NP synthesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8104-1589"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, 44000, Pakistan. movais@bs.qau.edu.pk."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, Beijing, 100190, China. movais@bs.qau.edu.pk."}], "LastName": "Ovais", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, 44000, Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine and Surgery, Qarshi University, Lahore, 54000, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khalil", "ForeName": "Ali Talha", "Initials": "AT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Sarhad University of Science and Information Technology, Peshawar, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Islam", "ForeName": "Nazar Ul", "Initials": "NU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life sciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM), Dhahran, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Irshad", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Malakand, Chakdara, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), 18000, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ayaz", "ForeName": "Muhamamd", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, Mekelle University, Mekelle, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Saravanan", "ForeName": "Muthupandian", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, 44000, Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine and Surgery, Qarshi University, Lahore, 54000, Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pakistan Academy of Sciences (PAS), Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shinwari", "ForeName": "Zabta Khan", "Initials": "ZK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA. sudip.mukherjee@rice.edu."}], "LastName": "Mukherjee", "ForeName": "Sudip", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Appl Microbiol Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8406612", "ISSNLinking": "0175-7598"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I3P9R8317T", "NameOfSubstance": "phenolic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Green Chemistry Technology"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29882162", "10.1007/s00253-018-9146-7", "10.1007/s00253-018-9146-7"]}}]}
