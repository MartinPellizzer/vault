Overall, the average mass concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> in indoors were found to be 263.24\u00b159.24 and 212.01\u00b138.06\u03bcgm<sup>-3</sup> while in outdoors the concentrations accounted to 194.28\u00b115.25 and 152.88\u00b116.31\u03bcgm<sup>-3</sup> respectively; exceeding WHO standards. In view of geographical variation, significantly higher (t=2.461; P=0.044) PM mass was found in outdoor samples of roadside location when compared to homes located far away from busy traffic; whereas indoor concentration exhibited non-significant relationship (t=1.887; P=0.095) between the two categorized homes. Findings of size partitioning trend through deployment of Sioutas Cascade Impactor evidenced presence of high proportion of PM and elemental concentrations within q-Acc and q-UF modes with their distribution pattern and probable emission sources conferred upon. Absence of modal peak in coarse range indicated predominance of anthropogenic emissions with presumed wash-out of coarse particles during frequent precipitation coincidental with sampling event. Seeming modal shifts for some elements (K, Cd, Zn) from q-Acc to q-UF were perceived during infiltration process. Presence of high traffic emission in homes near busy road stemmed the shifting of particles (Cu, K, Co, Zn) towards finer size (preferably q-UF mode) thus exposing residents to adverse health effects through their penetration (Finf=0.14) into indoor environment. Flat slopes (0.11) and poor correlation (8.4%) for metals in coarser range obtained through regression model hypothesized their high deposition velocities and low penetration efficiency. Our findings suggest enhanced resident exposure to fine particles (81%) especially q-UF range (37%) through indoor and outdoor (through infiltration) sources along with complexity of size distribution of airborne particles that prerequisites surplus consideration to achieve a healthier environment within residential area."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
