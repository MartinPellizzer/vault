Oxidative stress and inflammation are implicated in the development and progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). This study explored the cardioprotective effect of galangin (Gal), a natural flavonoid with radical-scavenging and anti-inflammatory activities, in diabetic rats. An experimental diabetic rat model was achieved by a single injection of 50\u00a0mg/kg streptozotocin. Gal (15\u00a0mg/kg) was administered daily for six weeks and the samples were then collected. Diabetic rats exhibited hyperglycemia, increased glycosylated hemoglobin, triglycerides and cholesterol levels and reduced serum insulin. Serum troponin I, CK-MB and LDH were increased in diabetic rats. Furthermore, hearts of diabetic rats were characterized by elevated malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl, NF-\u03baB p65, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, iNOS, IL-6, Bax, caspase-3 and 8-Oxo-dG, and decreased superoxide dismutase, catalase, reduced GSH, and Bcl-2. Gal ameliorated hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and heart function markers, and prevented histopathological alterations in diabetic rats. In addition, Gal attenuated cardiac oxidative injury, inflammation and apoptosis, and boosted antioxidant defenses. In conclusion, Gal has a protective effect on cardiomyopathy by attenuating hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, oxidative stress and inflammation in diabetic rats."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
