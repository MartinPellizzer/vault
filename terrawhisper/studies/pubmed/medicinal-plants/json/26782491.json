Morphological characteristics, such as head shape and diameter, leaf shape, and bract shape, are mainly affected by environmental conditions. A molecular marker approach was used to analyze the degree of polymorphism between artichoke hybrid lines. The degree of genetic difference among three artichoke hybrids was evaluated using random amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR). In this study, the DNA fingerprints of three artichoke lines (A13-010, A11-018, and A12-179) were generated, and a total of 10 decamer primers were applied for RAPD-PCR analyses. Polymorphism \u00a0(16.66 to 62.50%) was identified using eight arbitrary decamers and total genomic DNA extracted from the hybrids. Of the 59 loci detected, there were 25 polymorphic and 34 monomorphic loci. Jaccard's similarity index (JSI) ranged between 1.0 and 0.84. Based on the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) similarity matrix and dendrogram, the results indicated that two hybrids (A13-010 and A11-018) were closely related to each other, and the A12-179 line showed more divergence. When identifying correct accessions, consideration of the genetic variation and genetic relationships among the genotypes are required. The RAPD-PCR fingerprinting of artichoke lines clearly showed that it is possible to analyze the RAPD patterns for correlation between genetic means and differences or resemblance between close accessions (A13-010 and A11- 018) at the genomic level."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sara Alghonaim Research Chair, Biology Department, College of Science and Humanities, Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, Alkharj, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Sharaf-Eldin", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biology Department, Princess Noura University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Al-Tamimi", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sara Alghonaim Research Chair, Biology Department, College of Science and Humanities, Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, Alkharj, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alam", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sara Alghonaim Research Chair, Biology Department, College of Science and Humanities, Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, Alkharj, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Transformation and Biopharmaceuticals Lab, Agricultural Genetic Engineering Research Institute."}], "LastName": "Elkholy", "ForeName": "S F", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Big Heart Seed, Brawley, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Jordan", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Genet Mol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101169387", "ISSNLinking": "1676-5680"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chimera"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cynara scolymus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Fingerprinting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26782491", "10.4238/2015.December.23.31", "gmr7324"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
