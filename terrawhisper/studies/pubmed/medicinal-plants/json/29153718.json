The full contribution of conventional factors like pH, sorbent amount, eluent volume and sonication time on response were studied and optimized using response surface methodology (RSM) combined with central composite design (CCD). According best figures of merits were achieved at following conditions: pH of 8.0; 5.0\u202fmg sorbent and 5\u202fmin sonication which all accumulation Az-II was efficiently eluted by 180\u202f\u03bcL of dimethylformamide which consequently permit achievement recovery of 99.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.1%. Under specified best conditions using 10.0\u202fmL of sample at various conditions lead to detection limit (based on 3S<sub>b</sub>/m), limit of quantification (10S<sub>b</sub>/m) and the enrichment factor of 3.8, 12.6\u202fng\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup> and 75.2, respectively. The while method has linear response over 30-4500\u202fng\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup> of Az-II with acceptable correlation coefficient of R<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f0.9996. Inter- and Intra-day precision expressed as relative standard deviation (n\u202f=\u202f3) and the preconcentration factor were 1.1-4.0%, 1.4-5.0% and 55.6, respectively. Good recoveries (95.2-103.3%) with low relative standard deviations (1.1-5.0%) strongly support successful applicability of present method for Az-II preconcentration and determination."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.
