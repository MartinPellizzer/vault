The morphology of NH<sub>2</sub>-Zn/Fe-MIL-88 can be regulated from octahedral-like to spindle-like with changing molar ratios of metal salts. Using NH<sub>2</sub>-Zn/Fe-MIL-88 as sorbent, a dispersive solid-phase extraction with putting sorbents into sample solution to extract targets was developed to preconcentrate phytohormones in vegetables. To study the extraction efficiency, a series of NH<sub>2</sub>-Zn/Fe-MIL-88s with varying molar ratios of metal salts were prepared. The results indicated that NH<sub>2</sub>-Zn/Fe-MIL-88(1) presented the highest extraction efficiency (82.6\u00a0%-98.1\u00a0%) to phytohormones among all prepared NH<sub>2</sub>-Zn/Fe-MIL-88(x). The limits of detection were calculated at 0.07-0.15\u00a0ng/mL. The adsorption isotherms and kinetic parameters of NH<sub>2</sub>-Zn/Fe-MIL-88 for phytohormones were conformed to Langmuir and pseudo-second-order models. The NH<sub>2</sub>-Zn/Fe-MIL-88 as sorbent combined with HPLC was applied to detect phytohormones in cucumber and tomato samples."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
