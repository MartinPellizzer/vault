The plant growth and the content- of nitrogen-containing compounds, phenolics, and terpenoids were determined under different nitrate concentrations and salt stress. Different responses were observed among genotypes for both species. \u0301Chl\u00e1dek \u010derven\u00e1\u0301 had the best growth under low nitrate, with lower histamine and higher flavonoid levels. Mentha x piperita was the best mint species performing under low nitrate and salt stress. Altogether, we demonstrate that a combination of phenomics and metabolomics is ideal to identify the optimal growth conditions for these plants and the chemical markers associated with these conditions. Besides, we showed that both primary and secondary metabolites can be good markers for classifying both species."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
