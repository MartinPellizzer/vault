They were to exert a notable influence of later medical literature.", "An analysis of works such as Medicinalis liber by Benedictus Crispus of Milan; De cultura hortorum by Walahfrid Strabo; the anonymous work known as Macer floridus; De pulsibus, De urinis, and De signis et symptomatibus aegritudinum, three treatises by Aegidius of Corbeil or the Poema anatomicum, belonging to the Salerno Medical School, reveals what neurological aspects were known in the Middle Ages and how important this medical discipline was in that period. References to pathologies in the field of neurology are very frequent in mediaeval medical poems in Latin. They deal with diseases involving the nerves, cephalea, tremors, epilepsy, vertigos and disorders affecting memory or the sense organs.", "These mediaeval medical works in Latin offer us an interesting insight into the way neurological diseases were viewed by western physicians in the Middle Ages, as well as describing the remedies that were employed at that time to treat them, most of which involved the use of plants that were considered to have medicinal properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad de Valladolid, Espa\u00f1a."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Frutos-Gonz\u00e1lez", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guerrero-Peral", "ForeName": "A L", "Initials": "AL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "La neurologia en la poesia medica latina medieval."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Spain", "MedlineTA": "Rev Neurol", "NlmUniqueID": "7706841", "ISSNLinking": "0210-0010"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Education, Medical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Medieval"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Language"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Literature, Medieval"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine in Literature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "physiopathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Nervous System Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neurology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19434589", "rn2009090"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
