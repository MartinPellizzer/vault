Our previous study showed that exposure to mephedrone during pegnancy induced antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in hippocampus of mice delivered pups. However, its effects on neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PC) remain unexplored. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of mephedrone exposure on the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of rat embryonic NS/PC. NS/PC were isolated from rat fetal ganglionic eminence region at embryonic day 14.5. The effects of mephedrone on cell proliferation, neurosphere formation (colonies of NS/PC), neuronal differentiation, and apoptosis of NS/PC were assessed using MTT, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry. Mephedrone at concentrations of 20-640\u2009\u00b5M significantly decreased the proliferation of NS/PC, induced cell cycle arrest, and enhanced the percent of apoptotic and necrotic cells. Neurosphere assays revealed a significant reduction in the number and diameter of neurosphere-forming cells. In addition, mephedrone significantly decreased the expressions of DCX and NeuN neuronal markers. Taken together, our results suggeste that exposure to mephedrone decreases the viability and neuronal differentiation of embryonic NS/PC. This study showed that mephedrone exposure during fetal or neonatal life may impair neurogenesis and subsequent brain development."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alavi", "ForeName": "Mohaddeseh Sadat", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghnia", "ForeName": "Hamid Reza", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nikpasand", "ForeName": "Niloufar", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sahab Negah", "ForeName": "Sajad", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rashidi", "ForeName": "Roghayeh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gorgan Congenital Malformations Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Naseri", "ForeName": "Gholamreza", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1603-2619"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372712", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4212"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "8BA8T27317", "NameOfSubstance": "mephedrone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neural Stem Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neurogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neurons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36821836", "10.1139/cjpp-2022-0350"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
