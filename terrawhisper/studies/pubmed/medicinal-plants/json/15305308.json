Part III. Apigenin, baicalelin, kaempherol, luteolin and quercetin.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "516", "EndPage": "521", "MedlinePgn": "516-21"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Flavonoids are found universally in plants and act as free radical scavenging and chelating agents with antiinflammatory, antiischemic, vasodilating and chemoprotective properties. In this study, the antilipoperoxidative and cytoprotective effects of apigenin, baicalein, kaempferol, luteolin and quercetin against doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress were investigated in isolated rat heart cardiac myocytes, mitochondria and microsomes. After preincubation of cardiomyocytes with the test compounds for 1 h the cardiomyocytes were treated with the toxic agent, doxorubicin (100 micro M for 8 h). Cardiomyocyte protection was assessed by extracellular LDH and cellular ADP and ATP production. Cytoprotection was concentration dependent for baicalein > luteolin congruent with apigenin > quercetin > kaempferol. All test compounds had signi fi cantly better protective effects than dexrazoxan, an agent currently used for adjuvant therapy during anthracycline antibiotic therapy. In microsomes/mitochondria the IC(50) values of lipid peroxidation inhibition for quercetin, baicalein, kaempferol, luteolin, and apigenin were 3.1 +/- 0.2/8.2 +/- 0.6, 3.3 +/- 0.3/9.6 +/- 0.5, 3.9 +/- 0.3/10.1 +/- 0.8, 22.9 +/- 1.7/18.2 +/- 0.7, and 338.8 +/- 23.1/73.1 +/- 6.4 mM, respectively. The antilipoperoxidative activity of apigenin differed from its cytoprotective effects, but correlated with the free radical scavenging of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical and half peak oxidation potential (E(p/2)). Apigenin was the least effective of the flavonoids studied in all models except the cardiomyocyte model where its cardiomyocyte cytoprotective effect was comparable to other compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Olomouc, Czech Republic. psotova@tunw.upol.cz"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Psotov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Jitka", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chlopc\u00edkov\u00e1", "ForeName": "S\u00e1rka", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miketov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Petra", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hrb\u00e1c", "ForeName": "Jan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sim\u00e1nek", "ForeName": "Vil\u00edm", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Kaempferols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "49QAH60606", "NameOfSubstance": "baicalein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "731P2LE49E", "NameOfSubstance": "kaempferol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7V515PI7F6", "NameOfSubstance": "Apigenin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KUX1ZNC9J2", "NameOfSubstance": "Luteolin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apigenin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavanones"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Kaempferols"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luteolin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Myocytes, Cardiac"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15305308", "10.1002/ptr.1462"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
