Pregnant and nonpregnant female Wistar rats, guinea pigs, and dogs were used in this study. Strips obtained from 5 animals had spontaneous rhythmical contractions constant in amplitude and frequency. Muscular tone and frequency of contractions were notably increased by addition of 20 ul/ml of zoapatle aqueous crude extract (ZACE). The preparation returned to the original spontaneous contractility pattern after washing with a modified Ringer solution. Strips obtained from 5 gravid guinea pigs showed scarce spontaneous contractility which was strongly augmented by addition of ZACE. Regular spontaneous contractions were observed in over 30 assays of uterine strips obtained from 5 nongravid rats. The addition of ZACE drastically inhibited the spontaneous contractility. Constant and reproducible results were obtained in gravid rats by addition of ZACE. A gradual decrease in amplitude of contractions was observed. The addition of ZACE depressed the uterine contractility (UC) of 8 uterine strips from 2 animals. The addition of ZACE in gravid dogs in 8 uterine strips was accompanied by an increase of muscular tonus and frequency. A gradual decrease in the amplitude of the rat spontaneous UC was an effect produced by the HE. Addition of water suspension of HE elicited an immediate increase of guinea pig's uterine motility. Results were similar with those observed with ZACE. KA inhibited the \"in vitro\" rat UC and increased the \"in vitro\" guinea pig contractions of uterine musculature in a similar fashion as observed with ZACE and HE."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["014423", "00118706"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: CONTRACEPTION."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Animals, Laboratory", "Biology", "Clinical Research", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Evaluation", "Genitalia", "Genitalia, Female", "Health", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Physiology", "Plants, Medicinal", "Research Methodology", "Urogenital System", "Uterine Effects", "Uterus"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "6851560", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1983", "Month": "07", "Day": "08"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "08", "Day": "25"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0010-7824", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "27", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1983", "Month": "Mar"}}, "Title": "Contraception", "ISOAbbreviation": "Contraception"}, "ArticleTitle": "The zoapatle V--the effect of kauradienoic acid upon uterine contractility.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "267", "EndPage": "279", "MedlinePgn": "267-79"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Kauradienoic acid was obtained from the hexanic extract of M. tomentosa (Cerv) leaves by chromatographic separation.
