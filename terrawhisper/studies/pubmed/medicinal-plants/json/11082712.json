It was found that S-(-)-isomer was predominant for hyoscyamine and the ratio of R-(+)-isomer gradually increased during the growth, whereas in the case of scopolamine, S-(-)-isomer was the sole one found throughout the cultivation period. The 1H-NMR study in the CD3OD solution has suggested that S-(-)-hyoscyamine (1) and S-(-)-scopolamine (2) take a \"face-to-face\" conformation between their tropane skeletons and the benzene rings of the tropic acid moieties. In the presence of an equimolar NaOD in the CD3OD solution, the racemization at C-2' of 1 and 2 proceeded more rapidly than the hydrolysis at the tropic acid ester bond, presumably due to the steric hindrance caused by their \"face-to-face\" conformations. In the D2O and H2O solutions, on the other hand, the racemization and the hydrolysis of 1 proceeded smoothly, while those of 2 did not occur. It has been supposed that these individual reaction manners are ascribable in considerable extent to the different basicity of N atom in each tropane skeleton of 1 and 2 and to stronger intramolecular hydrogen bond occurring between the carbonyl oxygen at C-1' and the hydroxyl group at C-3' in the tropic acid moiety of 1."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kinki University, Osaka, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kitagawa", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ishizu", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohashi", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shibuya", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "7C0697DR9I", "NameOfSubstance": "Atropine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DL48G20X8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Scopolamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Atropine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Datura stramonium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Scopolamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}], "NumberOfReferences": "10"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11082712", "10.1248/yakushi1947.120.10_1017"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
