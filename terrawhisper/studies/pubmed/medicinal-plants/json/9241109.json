Surveys gathered data on use and motivations for use of complementary therapies. Complementary therapies included dietary, medicinal, tactile, and relaxation therapies. Statistical analyses were carried out using parametric and nonparametric measures and multivariate logistic analyses. Multivariate modeling considered age, income, education, time spent out of bed, and degree of pain as independent variables against complementary therapy use (Yes versus No). All reported p values are two-sided.", "A total of 657 participants completed an annual participant survey within the study period. Of these, 256 participants (39%) had ever used complementary therapies. Univariate analysis indicated that 195 patients (30%) had used dietary supplements, 141 (22%) had used herbal and other medicinal therapies, 145 (22%) had used tactile therapies, and 128 (20%) had used mental relaxation techniques. Multivariate analysis indicated that complementary use was independently associated with younger median age (p = .003), income >$7,300 U.S. (p = .014), having greater physical pain (p = .003), and a university education (p = .002).", "Use of complementary therapies in conjunction with HIV/AIDS medications appears to be most prevalent in young and highly educated individuals and to be associated with the debilitating and chronic nature of HIV disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, St. Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada."}], "LastName": "Ostrow", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cornelisse", "ForeName": "P G", "Initials": "PG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Heath", "ForeName": "K V", "Initials": "KV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Craib", "ForeName": "K J", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schechter", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "O'Shaughnessy", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Montaner", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hogg", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol", "NlmUniqueID": "9501482", "ISSNLinking": "1077-9450"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-HIV Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-HIV Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Educational Status"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food, Fortified"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "HIV Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Relaxation Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Socioeconomic Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9241109", "10.1097/00042560-199706010-00003"]}}]}
