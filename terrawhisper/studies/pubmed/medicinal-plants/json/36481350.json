To stave off such weaning-related problems, antibiotics and supplements containing high levels of ZnO are often used. In this study, we investigated whether natural fibres obtained from two plants known for their dietary fibre profile and antioxidant properties: flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) and hemp (Cannabis sativa L.), can serve as a health-promoting diet supplement. The study was conducted on a total of 191 Polish Large White piglets from 18 L, from their birth to 56\u202fdays of age. Piglets were divided by litters into six groups: W1.5, F1.5, H1.5, W2.0, F2.0, and H2.0. Groups W1.5, F1.5, and H1.5 received feed supplemented with 1.5% fibre from wood cellulose (W), flax (F), and hemp (H), respectively, while groups W2.0, F2.0, and H2.0 received feed with a higher 2.0% content of the same fibres. Flax and hemp fibres were characterised by a complex composition, antioxidant properties due to the presence of phenolic acids, and low risk of mycotoxin contamination. Flax fibre resulted in best weight gains and feed conversion ratio (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) of piglets, while hemp fibre had higher positive effect on antioxidant status (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) compared to the other two fibre additives. Neither flax nor hemp fibres had any adverse effect on the haematological and biochemical blood parameters. Piglets receiving a diet with 1.5% added fibre showed better growth performance, while diet supplementation with 2% fibre had a beneficial effect on the content of butyric acid in the small intestinal chyme (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05). The results suggested that both flax and hemp fibres can be innovative feed additives for weaned piglets. However, further studies should be conducted in commercial farms, as the effects of dietary fibre could vary in more challenging environmental conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
