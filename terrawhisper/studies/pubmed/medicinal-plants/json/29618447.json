For analgesic effect of the extracts, acetic acid induced writhing, tail immersion and hot plate tests were employed in mice. The anti-inflammatory activity was carried out by carrageenan induced inflammation in rats, whereas the diuretic action was determined using metabolic cages for rats. Animals were divided into six groups (n=7): (1) Control (2) Standard (3) MECAB 200 (4) MECAB 400 (5) MECAW 200 (6) MECAW 400. All extracts and standard drugs were administered orally. Acute oral toxicity of the extracts was also checked in mice up to 2000mg/kg dose, which showed a favorable safety. Significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects were observed. The results of diuretic activity were significant at 12th and 24th hrs. Therefore, it is concluded that the methanol extracts of the seeds of Cicer arietinum have analgesic, anti-inflammatory and diuretic potential."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Masroor", "ForeName": "Darakhshan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Baig", "ForeName": "Sadia Ghousia", "Initials": "SG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Salman", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Syed Muzzammil", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hasan", "ForeName": "Muhammad Mohtasheemul", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diuretics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9000-07-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Carrageenan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carrageenan"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cicer"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diuretics"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests, Acute"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29618447"]}}]}
