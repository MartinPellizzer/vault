This study investigates the effects of Antidesma madagascariense (AM) extract on the transport of D-glucose, L-tyrosine, fluid and electrolytes (Na+ and K+) across rat everted intestinal sacs. These sacs were mounted in an organ bath containing Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate (KHB) buffer. Experimental findings showed that incubation with graded aqueous AM extracts above 0.375 mg/mL significantly (P < 0.05) stimulated the mucosal disappearance and serosal appearance of glucose and fluid. The concentration of glucose accumulated in the intestinal tissues also increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared to that found in the controls. Transport of the amino acid L-tyrosine was not significantly enhanced (P > 0.05) when incubated with increasing concentrations of AM extract. Effects on electrolyte (K+ and Na+) transport were assessed. Na+ uptake and transport was significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) when incubated with 0.75 mg/mL AM extract; however, K+ transport was not significantly enhanced (P > 0.05). For comparison, insulin (1 and 2 units/mL) was incubated in the mucosal solution. Aqueous AM extract produced similar stimulatory effects on the transport of glucose, fluid and Na+ as were found with insulin. It is hypothesised that bioactive phytochemicals such as flavonoids, alkaloids, leucoanthocyanins, phenols and saponins from AM leaf extract might interfere with the Na+/glucose carrier, thereby enhancing the transport of glucose, Na+ and fluid across rat everted intestinal sacs. Thus, AM may represent a possible alternative dietary supplement for the treatment of type 2 diabetes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Mauritius, Reduit, Mauritius."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mahomoodally", "ForeName": "M F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fakim", "ForeName": "A Gurib", "Initials": "AG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Subratty", "ForeName": "A H", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Br J Biomed Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9309208", "ISSNLinking": "0967-4845"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Electrolytes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42HK56048U", "NameOfSubstance": "Tyrosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Electrolytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Euphorbia"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Intestines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mauritius"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osmosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tyrosine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16613135", "10.1080/09674845.2006.11732713"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
