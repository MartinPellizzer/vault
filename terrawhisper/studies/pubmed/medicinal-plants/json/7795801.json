The chromatographic procedure was tested by the investigation of jack bean urease hydrolysate. The method has been applied to the preparative separation of Z-amino acids (from 10 up to 16) obtained from protein hydrolysates of various sources (green microalgae, blue-green algae, halophilic and methylotrophic microorganisms) and was proved to be reliable by the separation of deuterated amino acids (enrichment 97-99%) from Methylobacillus flagellatum (due to the bioconversion of CD3OD and D2O). Independent of the biological source of the protein, the amino acids were isolated with high recovery (from 68% up to 89%) and chromatographic purity (from 96% up to 99%). The method was also applied for the isolation of phenylalanine and leucine excreted by amino-acid overproducing microorganisms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Lomonosov State Academy of Fine Chemical Technology, Moscow, Russian Federation."}], "LastName": "Egorova", "ForeName": "T A", "Initials": "TA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Eremin", "ForeName": "S V", "Initials": "SV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mitsner", "ForeName": "B I", "Initials": "BI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zvonkova", "ForeName": "E N", "Initials": "EN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shvets", "ForeName": "V I", "Initials": "VI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr B Biomed Appl", "NlmUniqueID": "9421796", "ISSNLinking": "1572-6495"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.5.1.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Urease"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyta"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Negative Aerobic Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Halobacteriaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Urease"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7795801", "10.1016/0378-4347(94)00528-d", "037843479400528D"]}}]}
