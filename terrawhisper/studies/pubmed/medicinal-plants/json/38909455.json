The juice was treated in the presence of kiwi juice (0-8%), and its physicochemical properties and microbial load were compared with raw juice. The study also highlighted the key enzymes causing sugarcane juice discoloration, peroxidase (POD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO), by quantifying kiwi juice constituents using GC-MS and monitoring their effects by molecular docking. Kiwi addition considerably raised (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) acidity, ascorbic acid (54.28%), and phenolic compounds (32%), and decreased the POD and PPO activity of raw cane juice. Pasteurization in the presence of kiwi, rather than microwave treatment, has significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increased the phenolic compounds and reduced POD and PPO activities until barley was detected. Molecular docking revealed that heptacosane, oleic acid, and melezitose are the primary kiwi components responsible for enzyme inactivation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
