The investigations in this aspect were limited to loco-regional sites of naso/oropharynx and oesophagus. The study of whether the oral fibrosis is part of a systemic spectrum of disease involving multiple organs is an interesting pursuit. With this intention the patients diagnosed on clinical and histological grounds for OSF were concurrently tested by biophysical means for the presence of endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF), pancreatic (PF) and retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF), which are endemic to the area studied. Twenty-five (n = 25) cases of OSF who visited the Department of Oral pathology & Microbiology. Govt. Dental College, Trivandrum, India for symptomatic relief of their illness comprised the study group. Ten (n = 10) age and sex matched healthy volunteers comprised the control. All the subjects have had undergone cardiologic and gastrointestinal investigations to rule out the possibility of concurrent EMF and PF. The patients were all of Indian ethnic extraction and mostly (> 90%) were from low socio economic classes. The mean age of the patients was 54.16 +/- 14.6 years, including 18 females and 7 males (F:M = 2.57:1). The severity of fibrosis was unrelated to the age of patients (P > 0.05). All the patients were chewers of areca quid (12%)/tobacco (88%). In addition to quid chewing 3/25 (12%) patients smoked 'bidi' and 6/25 (24%) consumed home brewed liquor (arrack/toddy) which contain about 40-50% ethanol. Statistically no relationship was observed between the clinical stages of OSF and severity of epithelial dysplasia in this study (P > 0.05). Out of the 25 patients, 5 (20%) showed sclerotic aortic value which may be an age related finding. Also 7 (28%) patients were found to be hypertensive and interstitial lung disease was present in 2 (8%). The possibility of EMF in one female patient who showed thickened RV apical endocardium was ruled out by cardiac catheterisation. Thus none of the patients showed evidence of endomyocardial fibrosis. The pancreas was found to be hyperchoic in 8(32 1/4) by ultra sonography. Liver was found to be hyperchoic in 6 (24%). Fat stain in stool samples was found to be positive in 13(58%). The hyperchogenecity of pancreas may be due to alcoholism or an underlying endocrine pancreatic insufficiency like diabetes and not due to pancreatic fibrosis. The positivity of fat stain could be due to fatty liver/alcoholism. Thus the study fails to reveal any evidence of pancreatic fibrosis in the group. The lack of any evidence of an associated visceral organ fibrosis in OSF made it prudent to believe that this is a loco-regional disease, initiated by local factors and propagated under their influence without systemic involvement."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology, Govt.
