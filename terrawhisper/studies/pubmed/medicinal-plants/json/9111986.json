This places the public at risk of unwanted effects from the use of herbal products that are adulterated with other substances and of forgoing effective conventional therapy. Moreover, consumers are exposed to a plethora of information portraying herbal products as harmless. Some progress has been made to address these concerns by facilitating the registration of herbal products as drugs.", "Most herbal products that were evaluated were unsafe or ineffective, or no information was available to evaluate their efficacy. Despite the perception that herbal products are innocuous, family physicians need to be aware that herbal therapy can be harmful in order to help their patients make informed choices."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Manitoba."}], "LastName": "Kozyrskyj", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can Fam Physician", "NlmUniqueID": "0120300", "ISSNLinking": "0008-350X"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Can Fam Physician. 1997 Jun;43:1047.", "PMID": "9189286"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Canada"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Consumer Product Safety"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug and Narcotic Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Inspection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "J Nutr. 1986 Jul;116(7):1348-54", "ArticleIdList": ["3528430"]}, {"Citation": "J Ethnopharmacol. 1993 Mar;38(2-3):197-208", "ArticleIdList": ["8510469"]}, {"Citation": "J Ethnopharmacol. 1993 Mar;38(2-3):145-52", "ArticleIdList": ["8510462"]}, {"Citation": "Ann Intern Med. 1992 Jul 15;117(2):165-6", "ArticleIdList": ["1605432"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Intern Med. 1991 Nov;151(11):2281-8", "ArticleIdList": ["1953234"]}, {"Citation": "Arthritis Rheum. 1991 Sep;34(9):1207", "ArticleIdList": ["1930341"]}, {"Citation": "Regul Toxicol Pharmacol. 1990 Dec;12(3 Pt 1):214-23", "ArticleIdList": ["2077558"]}, {"Citation": "Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 1989 Apr;32(4):1065-6", "ArticleIdList": ["2678162"]}, {"Citation": "Med J Aust. 1988 Dec 5-19;149(11-12):572-4", "ArticleIdList": ["3200177"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9111986", "PMC2255469"]}}]}
