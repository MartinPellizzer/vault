Medicinal plants can also have non-traditional use in phytoremediation technologies. Among the heavy metals, Cadmium (Cd) is the most abundant and readily taken up by the crop plants. Plant metallothioneins (MTs) are small proteins having cysteine-rich residues and appear to play key roles in metal homoeostasis. Plant metallothionein 2 (MT 2) from Coptis japonica (Gold-thread; CjMT 2) is a typical member of this subfamily and features two cysteine-rich regions containing eight and six cysteine residues, respectively, separated by 42 amino acids long linker region. In-silico analysis of MT 2 protein sequences of C. japonica was performed. In this study, ab initio methods were utilised for the prediction of three-dimensional structure of CjMT 2. After structure validation, heavy metal-binding sites were predicted for the selected modelled structures of CjMT 2. To obtain Cd<sub>i</sub>-CjMT 2 (i\u00a0=\u00a01-7), metalated complex individual docking experiments were performed. The stability of the metalated docked structures was assessed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. Our study showed that CjMT 2 binds up to 4 Cd<sup>2+</sup> ions in two distinct domains: a N-terminal \u03b2-domain that binds to 2 Cd<sup>2+</sup> ions and a C-terminal \u03b1-domain that binds with 2 Cd<sup>2+</sup> ions. Our analysis revealed that Cys residues of alpha and beta domain and some residues of spacer region of CjMT 2 protein might be important for the cadmium interaction. MD simulation studies provided insight into metal-induced conformational changes and mechanism of metalation of CjMT 2, an intrinsically disordered protein. This study provides useful insights into mechanism of cadmium-type 2 metallothionein interaction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants , Post Office CIMAP , Lucknow 226015 , India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR) , Ghaziabad 201002 , India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Garima", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4843-0248"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants , Post Office CIMAP , Lucknow 226015 , India."}], "LastName": "Tripathi", "ForeName": "Shubhandra", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Chemical Science Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants , Post Office CIMAP , Lucknow 226015 , India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR) , Ghaziabad 201002 , India."}], "LastName": "Shanker", "ForeName": "Karuna", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3271-5014"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants , Post Office CIMAP , Lucknow 226015 , India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR) , Ghaziabad 201002 , India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Ashok", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biomol Struct Dyn", "NlmUniqueID": "8404176", "ISSNLinking": "0739-1102"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Intrinsically Disordered Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9038-94-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Metallothionein"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coptis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Intrinsically Disordered Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metallothionein"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Binding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29624115", "10.1080/07391102.2018.1461688"]}}]}
