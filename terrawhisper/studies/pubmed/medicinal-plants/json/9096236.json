The ability of plant lectins to detect subtle variations in carbohydrate structures found on molecules, cells and organisms have made them a paradigm for protein-carbohydrate recognition. Legume lectins, one of the most well studied family of plant proteins, display a considerable repertoire of carbohydrate specificities owing perhaps to the sequence hypervariability in the loops constituting their combining site. However, lack of a rigorous framework to explain their carbohydrate binding specificities has precluded a rational approach to alter their ligand binding activity in a meaningful manner. This study reports an extensive analysis of sequences and structures of several legume lectins and shows that despite the hypervariability of their combining regions they exhibit within a significant pattern of uniformity. The results show that the size of the binding site loop D is invariant in the Man/Glc specific lectins and is possibly a primary determinant of the monosaccharide specificities of the legume lectins. Analyses of size and sequence variability of loops reveal the existence of a common theme that subserves to define their binding specificities. These results thus provide not only a framework for understanding the molecular basis of carbohydrate recognition by legume lectins but also a rationale for redesign of their ligand binding propensities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Biophysics Unit, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Surolia", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "2985088R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2836"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "28RYY2IV3F", "NameOfSubstance": "Fucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "577-76-4", "NameOfSubstance": "chitobiose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KM15WK8O5T", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylgalactosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylgalactosamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Disaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Bonding"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Monosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Structure, Secondary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Alignment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Software"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9096236", "10.1006/jmbi.1996.0863", "S0022-2836(96)90863-3"]}}]}
