The JAK inhibitors were previously designed and synthesized to treat diseases involving the hematologic and immune system. Increasing evidence shows that they are quite effective in Atopic Dermatitis (AD), Alopecia Areata (AA), psoriasis, vitiligo, and other autoimmuneinduced dermatologic conditions. Currently, many JAK inhibitors possessing anti-vitiligo activity are being investigated in the laboratory and clinically. In this view, we would like to summarize the applications of these inhibitors with emphasis on the profile of vitiligo, clinical efficacy, dosages, development of new candidates and adverse events through available literature."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization and Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi 830011, China | University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China | Nantong Chanyoo Pharmatech Co., Ltd., Nantong 226407, China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization and Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi 830011, China | University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Hunjun", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization and Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi 830011, China | University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Aisa", "ForeName": "Haji Akber", "Initials": "HA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2019425", "Agency": "Youth Innovation on Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Science", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2019Q028", "Agency": "Tianshan Youth Program of Xinjiang Autonomous Region in 2019", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2018D04020", "Agency": "Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mini Rev Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101094212", "ISSNLinking": "1389-5575"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Janus Kinase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "STAT Transcription Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.10.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Janus Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Janus Kinase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Janus Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "STAT Transcription Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Vitiligo"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "35"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33823765", "10.2174/1389557521666210325120233", "MRMC-EPUB-115057"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
