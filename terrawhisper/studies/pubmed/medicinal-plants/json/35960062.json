This study aims to investigate the efficacy of one of the most popular formulas, shokenchuto (SKT). We retrospectively analyzed 110 patients with NE who were referred to our department. Following the diagnosis of NE, treatment was started with either alarm or/and desmopressin (DDAVP) therapy. Patient refractory to DDAVP monotherapy or to combination therapy consisting of DDAVP and bedwetting alarm were selected. SKT (Tsumura Co., Tokyo, Japan) extract at a dose of 2.5\u2009g was administered orally to all intractable cases twice daily before meals. The treatment outcomes and safety were assessed. In total, 24 cases were patient refractory to DDAVP monotherapy or to combination therapy consisting of DDAVP and bedwetting alarm. SKT was highly effective in 8, effective in 7, and ineffective in 9. A significant difference was observed between ages 10 and over (P = 0.031). SKT was significantly effective as a treatment for NE in patients aged \u226510 years and could be a good alternative if alarm or DDAVP therapies are ineffective. We proposed evaluating SKT prospectively for NE."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 the Author(s).
