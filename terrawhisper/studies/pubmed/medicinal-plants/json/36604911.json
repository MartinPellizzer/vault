In this study, the color values of Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum Melle were digitized by a spectrophotometer, and the standard ranges of color values of the two herbal medicines were established. Further, a discriminant analysis model was established to quickly and accurately distinguish the two herbal medicines. The content of 9 flavonoids and 1 triterpene in Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum Melle were determined by HPLC, and Pearson correlation analysis was adopted to analyze the correlations between the color values and the content of 10 components. The standard ranges of L~*, a~*, and b~* values were 65.539 6-68.305 8, 7.296 3-8.467 3, and 29.998 8-32.212 8 for Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, and 43.654 3-47.166 4, 14.050 0-15.133 8, and 16.424 6-20.984 8 for Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum Melle, respectively. Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma had higher L~* and b~* values and lower a~* value than Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum Melle, which indicated that processing with honey decreased the white and yellow values and increased the red value. The original and cross validation of the established discriminant analysis model met the requirements, and the external validation of the model showed the prediction accuracy of 100%. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the a~* value was positively correlated with the content of liquiritin apioside and isoliquiritin apioside(P&lt;0.05), while the L~* and b~* values were negatively correlated with the content of the above two components(P&lt;0.05). After processing with honey, L~* and b~* decreased while a~* increased, and the content of liquiritin apioside and isoliquiritin apioside increased, which was consistent with the content determination results. This study reveals the regularity of the color values of Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma after processing with honey roasting, as well as the correlations between color values and component content, which provides a basis for the rapid quality evaluation of Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum Melle."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Engineering Center of State Ministry of Education for Standardization of Chinese Medicine Processing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wen-Xin", "Initials": "WX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Engineering Center of State Ministry of Education for Standardization of Chinese Medicine Processing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Engineering Center of State Ministry of Education for Standardization of Chinese Medicine Processing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Fang-Zhou", "Initials": "FZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Engineering Center of State Ministry of Education for Standardization of Chinese Medicine Processing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Tu-Lin", "Initials": "TL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Engineering Center of State Ministry of Education for Standardization of Chinese Medicine Processing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wei-Dong", "Initials": "WD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Center of State Ministry of Education for Standardization of Chinese Medicine Processing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Qian-Qian", "Initials": "QQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Yun-Feng", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Engineering Center of State Ministry of Education for Standardization of Chinese Medicine Processing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Li-Hong", "Initials": "LH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xun-Hong", "Initials": "XH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2788Z9758H", "NameOfSubstance": "glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "isoliquiritin apioside"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "23"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36604911", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210401.301"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
