Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood samples and the CYP19A1 polymorphisms were determined using the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Bone mineral density at the lumbar spine (L1-L4) was measured with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).", "The analysis of the CYP19A1 rs749292 polymorphism showed that there were no statistically significant differences in the distribution of genotypes between the study groups with osteoporosis and osteopenia and the control group. However, it was noted that the GG genotype occurred more often in the group with osteopenia (35.8%; OR = 1.44) than in the control group (27.9%). Also, a difference was noted in the distribution of genotypes in women with osteoporosis. In addition, it can be assumed that the G allele may lead to an increased susceptibility to osteopenia and osteoporosis. The analysis of the CYP19A1 rs700518 polymorphism showed that heterozygotes were more common in the group with osteoporosis (58.3%) than in the control group (52.8%).", "Our results suggest that the rs749292 polymorphism of the CYP19A1 gene may contribute to an elevated risk for fractures in postmenopausal Polish women."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Independent Public Clinical Hospital No. 1, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Kami\u0144ski", "ForeName": "Adam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Natural Fibers and Medicinal Plants, Plewiska, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Histocompatibility with Laboratory of Genetic Diagnostics, Regional Blood Center, Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "Bogacz", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Natural Fibers and Medicinal Plants, Plewiska, Poland."}], "LastName": "G\u00f3rska-Paukszta", "ForeName": "Ma\u0142gorzata", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Perinatology and Women's Diseases, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Phytochemistry, Institute of Natural Fibres and Medicinal Plants, Plewiska, Poland."}], "LastName": "Seremak-Mrozikiewicz", "ForeName": "Agnieszka", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Natural Fibers and Medicinal Plants, Plewiska, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacoeconomics, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Czerny", "ForeName": "Bogus\u0142aw", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Adv Clin Exp Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101138582", "ISSNLinking": "1899-5276"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Aromatase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "CYP19A1 protein, human"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Aromatase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bone Density"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osteoporosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoporotic Fractures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Postmenopause"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30855728", "10.17219/acem/103803"]}}]}
