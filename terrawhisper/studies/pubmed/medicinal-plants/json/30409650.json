It was hypothesized basil species and geographical properties significantly affect seed FA composition and quantity, which has not been previously investigated, to our knowledge. The collected seeds of the 18 basil populations were planted in a farmer's field, and the seed saturated (palmitic and stearic) and unsaturated (oleic, linoleic, and linolenic) FA were determined. Shiraz1 (14.7%) and Mobarakeh (5.1%) had the highest and the least rates of total FA, respectively. The populations were significantly different in terms of saturated FA ranging from 10.73% (Ardestan) to 13.51% (Bid Zard). However, the seed unsaturated FA (expect linoleic acid) were not significantly different from each other (average\u202f=\u202f87.27%).
