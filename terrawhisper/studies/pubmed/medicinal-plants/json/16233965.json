Antibacterial activity was detected using the disc-diffusion and micro-dilution assays. The extracts were tested against Gram-positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Of the 78 different plant extracts investigated, 80% showed activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in the disc-diffusion assay. In the micro-dilution assay, 60% of the plant extracts showed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values < or =1.56 mg ml(-1). The lowest MIC value (0.092 mg ml(-1)) was recorded for an ethyl acetate root extract of Acacia sieberiana against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In the anti-inflammatory assay, 70% of the investigated plant extracts (0.25 mg ml(-1)) inhibited both COX-1 and COX-2 activity (>50% and 70% for water and organic solvent extracts, respectively). An ethyl acetate leaf extract of Trichilia dregeana showed selective inhibition of COX-2 (81%). In the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory test, 21% of the plant extracts were active at a concentration < or =1 mg ml(-1) using the micro-dilution assay. The lowest IC(50) value was 0.04 mg ml(-1) obtained with an ethanol bark extract of Combretum kraussii. None of the investigated plants showed any potential mutagenic effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Plant Growth and Development, School of Biological and Conservation Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal Pietermaritzburg, Scottsville, South Africa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eldeen", "ForeName": "I M S", "Initials": "IM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elgorashi", "ForeName": "E E", "Initials": "EE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Staden", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16233965", "10.1016/j.jep.2005.08.049", "S0378-8741(05)00532-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
