IHp extract was administered at the doses of 50 and 200 mg/kg, p.o. and the brain monoamines were assayed after 30 min of the treatment. IHp treatment significantly decreased the levels of serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (5-HIAA) and 5-HT turnover in all the brain regions assayed. On the other hand, IHp treatment significantly augmented the levels of norepinephrine (NE) and its metabolite methylhydroxy phenyl glycol (MHPG) and NE turnover in all the brain regions studied. Similarly, the levels of dopamine (DA) were also significantly augmented in the hypothalamus, striatum and frontal cortex. Likewise, the levels of dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid (DOPAC), the major metabolite of DA, were also increased in these brain areas. Pharmacological studies with IHp extract have shown two major behavioural actions, namely, anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. The present findings tend to rationalise these observations, reduced 5-HT activity being consonant with anxiolytic and increased NA and DA activity being consonant with antidepressant action."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "P N", "Initials": "PN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhattacharya", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biogenic Monoamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "333DO1RDJY", "NameOfSubstance": "Serotonin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biogenic Monoamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neurochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Serotonin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11491577"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
