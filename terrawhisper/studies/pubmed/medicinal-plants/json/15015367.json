As a great number of the compounds are got in the world, a new strategy is developed to research the physicochemical properties of the compositions of herbs, so that the election of active compounds from the compositions has become more effective and more economical than before. The new strategy and associated technology have emerged and it was used extensively. The physicochemical properties of the compounds of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) relate to pharmaceutical and ADME (Absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination), and development, clinical effect and safety are evaluated with the properties. Therefore, the physicochemical properties are important in the development of TCM."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 610072, Sichuan, China. fengjan222@163.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Technology, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15015367"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
