Their structures were elucidated using comprehensive spectroscopic methods. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction of compound 5 was determined. Compounds 1-4 have a trans-3-(methylthio)-acrylic acid fragment, which are rare in nature. The inhibitory activities of all compounds against the nitric oxide (NO) production induced by lipopolysaccharide in mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells in vitro were evaluated."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
