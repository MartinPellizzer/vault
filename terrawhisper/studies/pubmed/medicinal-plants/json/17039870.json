The result showed that the absorption amounts of N, P and K were in the order of K > N > P under field condition. For one-year-old B. chinesnse DC., the average N, P2O5 and K2O absorption per 100 kg dry matter of root were 11.77 kg, 2.43 kg, 14.07 kg respectively; for two-year-old, the average N, P2O5 and K2O absorption amount per 100 kg dry matter of root were 12.11 kg, 2.74 kg, 18.39 kg respectively. The total absorption amount of N, P2O5 and K2O were lower in the first year, while the percentage of content was higher, that was to say, the demand for N, P and K was urgent in the first year. The accumulation peak of N, P2O5 and K2O occurred regreening to later elongation stage in the second year. The ratio of N, P and K were differential in different growth stages."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Northwest A & F University, Yangling 712100, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Zai-biao", "Initials": "ZB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Zong-suo", "Initials": "ZS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Xin-rong", "Initials": "XR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei-ling", "Initials": "WL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shu", "ForeName": "Zhi-ming", "Initials": "ZM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YLU75U4W", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphorus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RWP5GA015D", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bupleurum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorus"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17039870"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
