However, the mechanism by which BA confers these properties is currently unknown. <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, a budding yeast with a short life cycle and conserved cellular mechanism with high homology to humans, was used as a model for determining the role of BA in aging and programmed cell death (PCD). Treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) exhibited significantly increased (30-35%) survivability of antioxidant (<i>sod1\u0394, sod2\u0394, cta1\u0394, ctt1\u0394, and tsa1\u0394</i>) and anti-apoptotic (<i>pep4\u0394 and fis1\u0394</i>) mutant strains when cells were pretreated with BA (30\u2009\u00b5M) as demonstrated in spot and CFU (Colony forming units) assays. Measurement of intracellular oxidation level using the ROS-specific dye H<sub>2</sub>DCF-DA showed that all tested BA-pretreated mutants exhibited decreased ROS than the control when exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, when mutant strains were pretreated with BA and then exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, there was reduced lipid peroxidation as revealed by the reduced malondialdehyde content. Furthermore, BA-pretreated mutant cells showed significantly lower apoptotic activity by decreasing DNA/nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation under H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced stress as determined by DAPI and acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining. In addition, BA treatment also extended the life span of antioxidant and anti-apoptotic mutants by \u223c10-25% by scavenging ROS and preventing apoptotic cell death. Our overall results suggest that BA extends the chronological life span of mutant strains lacking antioxidant and anti-apoptotic genes by lowering the impact of oxidative stress, ROS levels, and apoptotic activity. These properties of BA could be further explored for its use as a valuable nutraceutical."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Plant Biology and Biotechnology Lab, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research Centre, Bengaluru, India."}], "LastName": "Sudharshan", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Plant Biology and Biotechnology Lab, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research Centre, Bengaluru, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, Ghaziabad, India."}], "LastName": "Krishna Narayanan", "ForeName": "Ananth", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pondicherry University, Pondicherry, India."}], "LastName": "Princilly", "ForeName": "Jemima", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pondicherry University, Pondicherry, India."}], "LastName": "Dyavaiah", "ForeName": "Madhu", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Plant Biology and Biotechnology Lab, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research Centre, Bengaluru, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, Ghaziabad, India."}], "LastName": "Nagegowda", "ForeName": "Dinesh A", "Initials": "DA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9423872", "ISSNLinking": "1029-2470"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4G6A18707N", "NameOfSubstance": "Betulinic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentacyclic Triterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Longevity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Betulinic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pentacyclic Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36624963", "10.1080/10715762.2023.2166505"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
