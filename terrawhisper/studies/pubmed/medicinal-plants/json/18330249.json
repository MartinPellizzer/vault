The two alkaloids were measured by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with UV detector. Transport parameters and apparent permeability coefficients (P(app)) were then calculated and compared with those of propranolol and atenolol. P(app) values were also compared with the reported values for model compounds (propranolol and atenolol).", "The P(app) values of COP, BRB were (1.103 +/- 0.162) x 10(-5), (1.309 +/- 0.102) x 10(-5) cm x s(-1 from AP side to BL side, and (0.300 +/- 0.041) x 10(-5) and (1.955 +/- 0.055) x 10(-5) cm x s(-1) from BL side to AP side, respectively. Their P(app) values were identical with those of propranolol [(2.23 +/- 0.10) x 10(-5 cm x s(-1)], which is a transcellular transport marker and as a control substance for high permeability. On the other hand, the efflux transport of BRB was higher 1.49 times more than its influx transport with 0.67 rate of P(app A-->B)/P(app B-->A). But P(app A-->B)/P(app B-->A value of COP was 3.67, which suggested that the efflux transport have not been involved in its absorbed mechanism in Caco-2 cells monolayers.", "COP and BRB can be absorbed across intestinal epithelial cells, and they are completely absorbed compounds.
