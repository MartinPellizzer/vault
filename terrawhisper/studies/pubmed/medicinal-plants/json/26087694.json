His past medical history was unremarkable except for having taken herbal medicine to treat facial palsy two months ago. The result of health examination performed about a month ago showed increased serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase level, and he was diagnosed with toxic hepatitis by herbal medicine. When the patient presented to the outpatient department three weeks ago, follow-up liver function test results showed improvement but he complained of abdominal pain. Despite extensive blood chemistry tests and computed tomography, the cause of pain could not be found. After much deliberation, serum lead level and herbal medicines analysis was performed based on the fact that he took herbal medicine two months ago, and he could finally be diagnosed with lead poisoning. Since the serum lead level was high enough to be indicated for lead chelating therapy, conservative management was given. When a patient with toxic hepatitis due to herbal medication presents with abdominal pain, the possibility of lead poisoning should always be taken into consideration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Haeundae Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea."}], "LastName": "Jeon", "ForeName": "Gi Jung", "Initials": "GJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Haeundae Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jong Ha", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Haeundae Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Min Sung", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Haeundae Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jong Won", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Haeundae Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jae Hyun", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Haeundae Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Min Sik", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Korean J Gastroenterol", "NlmUniqueID": "101189416", "ISSNLinking": "1598-9992"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemoglobins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Alanine Transaminase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hemoglobins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lead Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26087694", "10.4166/kjg.2015.65.6.375", "kjg.2015.65.6.375"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
