At present, norflurazon (<b>NRF</b>) is the only commercial pyridazine herbicide targeting PDS. Therefore, developing new and diverse pyridazine herbicides targeting PDS is urgently required. In this study, diflufenican (<b>BF</b>) was used as the lead compound, and a scaffold-hopping strategy was employed to design and synthesize some pyridazine derivatives based on the action mode of <b>BF</b> and PDS. The preemergence herbicidal activity tests revealed that compound 6-chloro-<i>N</i>-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-3-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)pyridazine-4-carboxamide (<b>B1</b>) with 2,4-diF substitution in the benzeneamino ring showed 100% inhibition rates against the roots and stems of <i>Echinochloa crus-galli</i> and <i>Portulaca oleracea</i> at 100 \u03bcg/mL, superior to the inhibition rates of <b>BF</b>. Meanwhile, compound <b>B1</b> demonstrated excellent postemergence herbicidal activity against broadleaf weeds, which was similar to that of <b>BF</b> (inhibition rate of 100%) but superior to that of <b>NRF</b>. This indicated that 6-Cl in the pyridazine ring is the key group for postemergence herbicidal activity. In addition, compound <b>B1</b> could induce downregulation of PDS gene expression, 15-<i>cis</i>-phytoene accumulation, and Y(II) deficiency and prevent photosynthesis. Therefore, <b>B1</b> can be considered as a promising candidate for developing high-efficiency PDS inhibitors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide, Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide and Agricultural Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Natural Products Research Center of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide, Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide and Agricultural Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, PR China."}], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Qiong", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide, Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide and Agricultural Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, PR China."}], "LastName": "Geng", "ForeName": "Wang", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Natural Products Research Center of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Daoping", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4070-0824"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide, Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide and Agricultural Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, PR China."}], "LastName": "Gan", "ForeName": "Xiuhai", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.-", "NameOfSubstance": "phytoene dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "449GLA0653", "NameOfSubstance": "pyridazine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pyridazines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Echinochloa"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "chemistry", "antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "antagonists & inhibitors", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Weeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38781442", "10.1021/acs.jafc.3c09350"]}}]}
