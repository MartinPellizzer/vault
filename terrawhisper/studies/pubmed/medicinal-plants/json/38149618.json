In this investigation, polysaccharides from <i>A. auricula</i> were obtained using six extraction techniques (ammonium oxalate solution extraction, sodium hydroxide solution extraction, hot water extraction, pectinase and cellulase-assisted extraction, ultrasonic-assisted extraction, and microwave-assisted extraction). Subsequently, a comprehensive comparison was conducted to evaluate their physicochemical properties and biological functionalities. The ammonium oxalate solution extraction method yielded a higher extraction rate (11.76%) and polysaccharide content (84.12%), as well as a higher uronic acid content (10.13%). Although the six <i>Auricularia</i> polysaccharides had different molecular weight distributions, monosaccharide molar ratios, similar monosaccharide compositions, and characteristic functional groups of polysaccharides, they exhibited different surface morphology. In vitro assays showed that polysaccharides extracted by ammonium oxalate solution possessed good scavenging ability against DPPH free radical, hydroxyl free radical and superoxide anion free radical as well as reduction power of iron ion. At the same time, both polysaccharides extracted by ammonium oxalate solution and sodium hydroxide solution promoted NO production in mouse macrophages along with the secretion of cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6. These results indicated significant differences in the structure and characteristics among <i>Auricularia</i> polysaccharides prepared by various extraction methods, which may be related to the variety or origin of <i>A. auricula</i>; furthermore, their bioactivities varied accordingly in\u00a0vitro assays where the ammonium oxalate solution extraction method was found more beneficial for obtaining high-quality bioactive <i>Auricularia</i> polysaccharides."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5026-1493"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, Sichuan Industrial Institute of Antibiotics, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, Sichuan Industrial Institute of Antibiotics, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, Sichuan Industrial Institute of Antibiotics, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, Sichuan Industrial Institute of Antibiotics, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, Sichuan Industrial Institute of Antibiotics, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Sizhu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, Sichuan Industrial Institute of Antibiotics, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Prep Biochem Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "9607037", "ISSNLinking": "1082-6068"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fungal Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Auricularia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RAW 264.7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "isolation & purification", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fungal Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "isolation & purification", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "isolation & purification", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "49"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38149618", "10.1080/10826068.2023.2297689"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
