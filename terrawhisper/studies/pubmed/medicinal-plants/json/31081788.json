The Genus Buddleja have more than 100 species, many of them are distributed in Mediterranean and Asian regions. A very small number of common species of the Genus in majority of fruiting plants have been investigated for their biological potential. So for, isolation of about 153 or more new/novel chemical substances have been reported. Purposes of the review is to discuss the structurally established and pharmacologically significant natural substances from wide variety of different species of this genus. Traditionally, species of the genus are reported to be used for healing, treatment of liver diseases, bronchial complaints, preventing several other diseases by exhibiting diuretic properties, sedative functions, analgesic potential, antirheumatic actions, antimicrobial activities, anti hyperglycemic functions and antioxidant properties. In this review we will describe recently established medicinal chemistry aspects and complete list of phytoconstituents as well as their sources and reference."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chemical Sciences, Gomal University, Dera Ismail Khan, KPK, Pakistan / State Key Laboratory of Organic-Inorganic Composites, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, PR China."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Shafiullah", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Arts & Basic Sciences, BUITEMS, Quetta, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ullah", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Organic-Inorganic Composites, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Liqun", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diuretics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypnotics and Sedatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Parasympatholytics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Steroids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Buddleja"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diuretics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypnotics and Sedatives"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Parasympatholytics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Steroids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31081788"]}}]}
