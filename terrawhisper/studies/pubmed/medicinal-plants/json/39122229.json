Profiling the essential organs and tissues with medicinal significance on a global scale offers valuable insights for enhancing the yield of desirable compounds in Perilla and other medicinal plants. In the present study, genome-wide RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and assessing the global spectrum of metabolites were carried out in the two major organs/tissues of stem (PfST) and leaf (PfLE) in Perilla. The results showed a total of 18,490 transcripts as the DEGs (differentially expressed genes) and 144 metabolites as the DAMs (differentially accumulated metabolites) through the comparative profiling of PfST vs PfLE, and all the DEGs and DAMs exhibited tissue-specific trends. An association analysis between the transcriptomics and metabolomics revealed 14 significantly enriched pathways for both DEGs and DAMs, among which the pathways of Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism (ko00260), Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism (ko00630), and Glucagon signaling pathway (ko04922) involved relatively more DEGs and DAMs. The results of qRT-PCR assays of 18 selected DEGs confirmed the distinct tissue-specific characteristics of all identified DEGs between PfST and PfLE. Notably, all eight genes associated with the flavonoid biosynthesis/metabolism pathways exhibited significantly elevated expression levels in PfLE compared to PfST. This observation suggests a heightened accumulation of metabolites related to flavonoids in Perilla leaves. The findings of this study offer a comprehensive overview of the organs and tissues in Perilla that have medicinal significance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
