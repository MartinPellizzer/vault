Delarbre (family Polygonacea), commonly known as Polygonum hydropiper, is a popular medicinal plant used in traditional medicine. The plant is indigenous to the tropical northern hemisphere and temperate zone, including China, Bangladesh, India, and Japan. The plant is used in folk medicine for numerous ailments such as hemorrhoids, antifertility, diarrhea, and dyspepsia. Its medicinal usage in Unani, Ayurveda, Siddha, and other traditional medicine is well-recognized. So far, a wide range of active phytochemicals of this plant has been identified, such as flavonoids, sulphated flavonoids, terpenoids, anthraquinones, steroids, coumarin, simple phenolics, and others. Pharmacological data reported in the literature suggest that various parts of P. hydropiper exhibit antimicrobial, antioxidant, hypoglycemic, antidepressant, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, anticancer, and antifertility effects. The present review aims to compile the coherently document research on the phytochemical, pharmacological, and biological activities of P. hydropiper from different parts of the globe."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Nasir", "ForeName": "Abdul", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Medical Sciences, Rawalpindi 46000, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khalil", "ForeName": "Atif A K", "Initials": "AAK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Medical Sciences, Rawalpindi 46000, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Bhatti", "ForeName": "Muhammad Z", "Initials": "MZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioinformatics and Biological statistics, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Ur Rehman", "ForeName": "Ashfaq", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic &amp; Developmental Sciences, School of Life Sciences &amp; Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jiayi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Parveen", "ForeName": "Zahida", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polygonaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33655861", "10.2174/1568026621666210303145045", "CTMC-EPUB-114717"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
