The results showed that the three stilbenes had the activity to inhibit the AGEs formation in BSA-acrolein and BSA-methylglyoxal models, especially piceatannol which showed the strongest inhibition effects on the formation of AGEs with the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>) value of 2.44\u202fmM and 0.19\u202fmM in the BSA-acrolein and BSA-methylglyoxal model, respectively. In addition, the three stilbenes showed the ability to scavenge acrolein and methylglyoxal in pH 7.4 at 37\u202f\u00b0C. Eight isolated adducts between three stilbenes and toxic carbonyls further confirmed that these three stilbenes could scavenge acrolein and methylglyoxal by forming adducts successfully. Thus, the present study suggested that the consumption of foods containing stilbenes was beneficial for controlling the amount of reactive carbonyl species and the AGEs formation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
