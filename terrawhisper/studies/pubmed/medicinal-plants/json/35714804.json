Over the years, over-exploitation, un-managed harvesting, and lack of captive cultivation procedures persuaded threat to its wild habitat. Plant tissue culture and RNA-Seq-based molecular bioprospection of key regulatory genes aid the understanding of molecular dynamics involved in specialized metabolites (phenylethanoids and phenylpropanoids) biosynthesis and its sustainable production. Hence, comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed using leaf and root tissues from the wild and tissue-cultured plants, revealing tissue-specific production of salidroside and rosavin. The transcriptome profiling resulted in 345 million high-quality reads yielding 92,380 unique transcripts with an N<sub>50</sub> of 1260\u00a0bp. Tissue-specific gene expression analysis revealed that both phenylethanoids and phenylpropanoids biosynthesis are predominantly associated with the shikimate pathway. In addition to RNA-Seq data, the downstream biosynthesis pathways genes viz., phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxyheptonate aldolase (DAHPS), 3-dehydroquinate synthase (DHQS), shikimate kinase (SK), chorismate mutase (CM), arogenate dehydrogenase (TYRAAT), aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (TDC), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4-CL), cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR), and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) showed higher expression pattern in wild plant tissues compared to tissue-cultured plants. The transcript fold expression determined by RT-qPCR results followed similar patterns as those observed in RNA-seq and targeted metabolite profiling data. Salidroside and rosavin content in wild plants exhibited 2.40 fold and 1.77 fold increase accumulation compared to the tissue-cultured plant. The present investigation explained the tissue and condition-specific significant differences between the expression of proposed biosynthetic pathway genes and salidroside and rosavin content. Additionally, NAC, bHLH, and ARF were the most abundant transcription factor families found in the transcriptomic analysis of R. imbricata. The generated transcriptome dataset provides a valuable gene(s)/transcription factors hub that can be used for the sustainable production of salidroside and rosavin in R. imbricata under tissue culture conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
