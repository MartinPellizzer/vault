Maximum throughput and minimal production costs can be achieved by the use of total chiral column length in this mode of chromatography. To maximize sample loading, often touching bands of the two enantiomers is automatically achieved. Conventional equations show direct correlation between touching-band loadability and the selectivity factor of two enantiomers. The important question for one who wants to obtain the highest throughput is \"How to optimize different factors including selectivity, resolution, run time, and loading of the sample in order to save time without missing the touching-band resolution?\" To answer this question, tramadol and propranolol were separated on cellulose 3,5-dimethyl phenyl carbamate, as two pure racemic mixtures with low and high solubilities in mobile phase, respectively. The mobile phase composition consisted of n-hexane solvent with alcohol modifier and diethylamine as the additive. A response surface methodology based on central composite design was used to optimize separation factors against the main responses. According to the stacked injection properties, two processes were investigated for maximizing throughput: one with a poorly soluble and another with a highly soluble racemic mixture. For each case, different optimization possibilities were inspected. It was revealed that resolution is a crucial response for separations of this kind. Peak area and run time are two critical parameters in optimization of stacked injection for binary mixtures which have low solubility in the mobile phase."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0658-4783"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Department, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti UniversityEvin, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Taheri", "ForeName": "Mohammadreza", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Department, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti UniversityEvin, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fotovati", "ForeName": "Mohsen", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "TEMAD Company, R&D director, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Seyed-Kiumars", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Department, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti UniversityEvin, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghassempour", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Chirality", "NlmUniqueID": "8914261", "ISSNLinking": "0899-0042"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28749545", "10.1002/chir.22727"]}}]}
