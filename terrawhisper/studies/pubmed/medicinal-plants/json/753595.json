The polylamellated organization of the wall was seen. Freeze-etching clearly visualized, within one single fracture plans, the intermediate strata in which the microfibril orientation gradually changes between the main transverse and longitudinal directions. They corresponded to the bow-shaped arcs seen with surface replication and conventional microtomy. The organization of newly-formed microfibrils (periplasmic microfibrils) was seen by their imprints on the plasmalemma. When they were being deposited the microfibrils were loose and sinuous though tightly packed, rigid and parallel on the further layers. Therefore it seems that the fibrillogenesis and the spatial orientation of the microfibrils are two subsequent steps. The role of the periplasm in controlling the three-dimensional arrangement of the wall is emphasized."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vian", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mueller", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cytobios", "NlmUniqueID": "0207227", "ISSNLinking": "0011-4529"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Wall"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Freeze Etching"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Development"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["753595"]}}]}
