Consequently, the inhibition of the products of these expressedgenes has emerged as a rational approach in cancer therapy. The apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) protein, encoded by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 5 (MAP3K5) gene, plays pertinent roles in the mediation of cell death induced by stress and inflammation, andis often found at elevated levels in cancer. Consequently, it has emerged as a molecular target for the development of potential chemotherapeutics through identification of selective inhibitors. However, there is still dearth of ASK1 inhibitors in clinical use. Hence, molecular modelling approaches were employed in this study to discover potential ASK1 inhibitors from phytochemicals. Twenty-five phytocompounds from four medicinal plants were tested for their inhibitory prowess via molecular docking. Interestingly, all the compounds exhibited promising inhibitory potentials for ASK1. However, further subjection to filtering procedures via different pipelines including drug-likeness evaluation, pharmacokinetics screening, toxicity profiling, and better affinities compared to the approved inhibitor resulted in three hit compounds namely ellagic acid, luteolin, and kaempferol with suitable properties. Profiling of the interactions formed between the hit\\compounds and the targets revealed several interactions that were not present in that of the approved inhibitor, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed the complexes formed as stable. Conclusively, this study identified three compounds with ASK1 inhibitory potentials that are worthy of further exploration in <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> and <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> studies.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
