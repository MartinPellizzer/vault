Like the SBMV-C genomic RNA, the sgRNA has a viral protein (VPg) covalently bound to its 5' end. The mechanism(s) by which ribosomes initiate translation on the SBMV-C RNAs is not known. To begin to characterize the translation of the sgRNA it was first necessary to precisely map its 5' end. Primer extension was used to identify SBMV-C nucleotide (nt) 3241 as the transcription start site. As a control, the 5' end of the genomic RNA was also mapped. Surprisingly, the 5' terminal nt of this RNA was identified as SBMV-C nt 2. The primary structure of the 5' ends of these two RNAs is therefore expected to be VPg-ACAAAA. Precise mapping of the 5' end of the sgRNA of the bean strain of SBMV (SBMV-B) demonstrated that it has these same elements. Translation of coat protein from the SBMV-C sgRNA and p21 from the SBMV-C genomic RNA was compared using a cell-free system. The results of these experiments were consistent with translation of these proteins by a 5' end-dependent scanning mechanism rather than by internal ribosome binding."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Center for Legume Research, University of Tennessee, Knoxville 37996-0845, USA. hacker@utk.edu"}], "LastName": "Hacker", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sivakumaran", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM50350", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Virology", "NlmUniqueID": "0110674", "ISSNLinking": "0042-6822"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Mapping"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9268164", "10.1006/viro.1997.8667", "S0042-6822(97)98667-0"]}}]}
