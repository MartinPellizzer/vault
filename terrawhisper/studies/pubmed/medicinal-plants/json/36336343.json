The current study evaluated eucalyptol wound healing activity in the rat's third-degree skin-burn model. The parameters, i.e., skin-healing, oxidative/antioxidant markers, pro-/anti-inflammatory markers, were evaluated after 1- and 2-weeks of treatment regimens with 5% eucalyptol ointment. Eucalyptol-loaded ointment base of 5% w/w strength was formulated using fusion method and physically evaluated for consistency, stability, and homogeneity. A 25-rats were divided randomly into intact, negative control (untreated), silver sulfadiazine (SS, positive control), 1-week, and 2-weeks treated eucalyptol groups. Using an aluminum cylinder (120\u2103, 10 second duration), 3<sup>rd</sup>-degree skin burns were created on the rat's dorsum. Skin biopsies were collected at the end of the experiment for biochemical and histological investigations. Compared to the negative group; time-dependent wound size reduction and decreased edema were observed in eucalyptol-treated animals. Histopathological examinations demonstrated epidermis integrity, decreased neutrophil, and increased capillaries number in the 2-weeks and SS groups, compared to the negative and 1-week treated eucalyptol groups. Compared to the untreated animals, the 1- and 2-weeks eucalyptol treated groups' demonstrated significantly increased antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD, p=0.002 and p=0.003, respectively) and reduced lipid peroxide (LP, p=0.005 and p=0.0006, respectively). However, a significant increment of catalase (CAT, p=0.0009) was found only in the 2-weeks of eucalyptol group at a level of 2.42 \u00b1 0.39 ng/g compared to 1.14 \u00b1 0.04 ng/g in the untreated animals. Also, significant reductions in the cytokines, IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 (p < 0.05); and increase in the pro-angiogenic marker, IL-10, were detected in the 2-weeks (p=0.001) and SS (p=0.002) treated animals compared to the negative and 1-week eucalyptol treated groups. The study concluded that eucalyptol induced significant duration-based wound healing properties attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2896-6790"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, Qassim University."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University."}], "LastName": "Mohammed", "ForeName": "Hamdoon A", "Initials": "HA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, Qassim University."}], "LastName": "Mohammed", "ForeName": "Salman A A", "Initials": "SAA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, Qassim University."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Omar", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1426-4894"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, Qassim University."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Al-Azhar University."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Hussein M", "Initials": "HM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Oleo Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101175339", "ISSNLinking": "1345-8957"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ointments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RV6J6604TK", "NameOfSubstance": "Eucalyptol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ointments"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Eucalyptol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Burns"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36336343", "10.5650/jos.ess22214"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
