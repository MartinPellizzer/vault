In Bangladesh, the Chakma indigenous community has been using Allophylus villosus and Mycetia sinensis to treat various types of pain and inflammation.", "The object of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of these plants in relieving pain and their antioxidant properties using various approaches such as in vitro, in vivo, and computational techniques. Additionally, the investigation will also analyse the phytochemicals present in these plants.", "We conducted in vivo analgesic experiment on Swiss albino mice and in-silico inhibitory activities on COX-2 & 15-LOX-2 enzymes. Assessment of DPPH, Anti Radical Activities (ARA), FRAP, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Free Radical Scavenging, Reducing the power of both plants performed significant % inhibition with tolerable IC<sub>50</sub>. Qualitative screening of functional groups of phytochemicals was pr\u00e9cised by FTIR and GC-MS analysis demonstrated phytochemical investigations.", "The ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fractioned Mycetia sinensis extract as well as the ethanoic extract and all fractioned extracts of Allophylus villosus have reported a significant percentage (%) of writhing inhibition (p<0.05) with the concentrated doses 250 mg as well as 500 mg among the Swiss albino mice for writhing observation of analgesic effect. In the silico observation, a molecular-docking investigation has performed according to GC-MS generated 43 phyto-compounds of both plants to screen their binding affinity by targeting COX-2 and 15-LOX-2 enzymes. Consequently, in order to assess and ascertain the effectiveness of the sorted phytocompounds, ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) investigation, DFT (Density-functional theory) by QM (Quantum mechanics), and MDS (Molecular dynamics simulation) were carried out. As the outcome, compounds like 5-(2,4-ditert-butylphenoxy)-5-oxopentanoic acid; 2,4-ditert-butylphenyl 5-hydroxypentanoate; 3,3-diphenyl-5-methyl-3H-pyrazole; 2-O-(6-methylheptan-2-yl) 1-O-octyl benzene-1,2-dicarboxylate and dioctan-3-yl benzene-1,2-dicarboxylate derived from the ethnic plant A. villosus and another ethnic plant M. sinensis extracts enchants magnificent analgesic inhibitions and performed more significant drug like activities with the targeted enzymes.", "Phytocompounds from A. villosus &M. sinensis exhibited potential antagonist activity against human 15-lipoxygenase-2 and cyclooxygenase-2 proteins. The effective ester compounds from these plants performed more potential anti-nociceptive activity which could be used as a drug in future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
