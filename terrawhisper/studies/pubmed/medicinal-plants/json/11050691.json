The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and treated with 5, 25, 50, 125, 250 and 500 microg/ml of AM, diallyl disulfide (DD), diallyl trisulfide (DT), steam-distilled garlic oil (SD) or vinyl-dithiin oil of garlic (VD) for 4 h. At concentrations up to 50 microg/ml, no significant cytotoxic effect was found in any group, but at concentrations above 250 microg/ml, the cell viability decreased drastically in all groups compared to the control. The treatment of cells with 25 microg/ml (non-cytotoxic concentration) of AM, DD, DT, SD for 4 h significantly inhibited [3H]acetate incorporation into cholesterol compared to that of the control (P < 0.05). The secretion of cholesterol into the medium was also significantly decreased in all groups except for VD. The treatment of cells with those allium constituents had no effect on either [3H]acetate incorporation into fatty acids or [3H]glycerol incorporation into triglyceride or phospholipid."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Nutritional Sciences, University of Illinois and Harlan E.
