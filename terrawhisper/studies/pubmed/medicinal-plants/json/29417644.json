An increasing number of women put their own and the unborn child's health at risk due to a lack of knowledge about the phytochemical properties and adequate use of herbal medicine (phytomedicines or herbal supplements) and lack of communication with their healthcare provider. The purpose of this narrative review was to summarize the use of herbal medicines during pregnancy and their potential toxic effects to highlight the importance of caution when prescribing herbal medicines or supplements for women, because, in addition to suffering interactions and a great amount of information obtained in preclinical predictive studies, assessment of nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, genotoxicity, and teratogenicity of traditional medicinal herbs still remains scarce in the clinical setting."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1603-3777"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Gynecology, Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo (UNIFESP), S\u00e3o Paulo, 04021-001, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Bruno", "ForeName": "Luciana O", "Initials": "LO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), S\u00e3o Paulo, 05508-010, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Simoes", "ForeName": "Ricardo Santos", "Initials": "RS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Morphology and Genetics, Federal University of Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), S\u00e3o Paulo, 04021-001, Brazil."}], "LastName": "de Jesus Simoes", "ForeName": "Manuel", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Gynecology, Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo (UNIFESP), S\u00e3o Paulo, 04021-001, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Gir\u00e3o", "ForeName": "Manoel Jo\u00e3o Batista Castello", "Initials": "MJBC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2302-8949"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida (UFL), Gainesville, 32611, FL, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biobehavioral Nursing Science, College of Nursing, University of Florida (UFL), Gainesville, 32611, FL, USA."}], "LastName": "Grundmann", "ForeName": "Oliver", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Complications"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Women's Health"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29417644", "10.1002/ptr.6020"]}}]}
