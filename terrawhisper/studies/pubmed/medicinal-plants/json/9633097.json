Lactococcin R was sensitive to some proteolytic enzymes (proteinase-K, pronase-E, proteases, pepsin, alpha-chymotrypsin) but was resistant to trypsin, papain, catalase, lysozyme and lipase, organic solvents, or heating at 90 degrees C for 15, 30 and 60 min, or 121 degrees C for 15 min. Lactococcin R remained active after storage at -20 and -70 degrees C for 3 months and after exposure to a pH of 2-9. The molecular weight of lactococcin R was about 2.5 kDa. Lactococcin R was active against many food-borne pathogenic and food spoilage bacteria such as Clostridium, Staphylococcus, Listeria, Bacillus, Micrococcus, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Streptococcus and Pediococcus spp., but was not active against any Gram-negative bacteria. Lactococcin R was produced during log phase and reached a maximum activity (1600 AU ml-1) at early stationary phase. The highest lactococcin R production was obtained in MRS broth with 0.5% glucose, at 6.5-7.0 initial pH values, 30 degrees C temperature and 18-24-h incubation times. Lactococcin R adsorbed maximally to its heat-killed producing cells at pH 6-7 (95%). Crude lactococcin R at 1280 AU ml-1 was bactericidal, reducing colony counts of Listeria monocytogenes by 99.98% in 3 h. Lactococcin R should be useful as a biopreservative to prevent growth of food-borne pathogenic and food spoilage bacteria in ready-to-eat, dairy, meat, poultry and other food products. Lactococcin R differs from nisin in having a lower molecular weight, 2.5 kDa vs 3.4 kDa, and in being sensitive to pepsin and alpha-chymotrypsin to which nisin is resistant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Arkansas Biotechnology Center, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville 72704, USA. yildirim@mars.uark.edu"}], "LastName": "Yildirim", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Lett Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8510094", "ISSNLinking": "0266-8254"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacteriocins"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Lett Appl Microbiol. 1999 Feb;28(2):157. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2672.1999.00501.x", "PMID": "10206654"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteriocins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cold Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Lactococcus lactis"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mustard Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9633097", "10.1046/j.1472-765x.1998.00335.x"]}}]}
