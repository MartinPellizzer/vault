When mice were immunized subcutaneously (s.c.) with KLH (20 micrograms/mouse) admixed with or without 50 ng/mouse of KML-C (KLH + KML-C), mice immunized with KLH + KML-C showed significantly higher antibody titers against KLH than those immunized with KLH alone, showing the highest titer 5 weeks after immunization. Furthermore, boost immunization with KLH + KML-C at 2-week interval elicited much higher activity than single immunization to enhance antibody responses against KLH. The assay for determining isotypes of antibodies revealed that KML-C augmented KLH-specific antibody titers of IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b. The culture supernatants obtained from the splenocytes of mice treated with KLH + KML-C also showed a higher level of both KLH-specific Th-1 (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) and Th-2 type cytokine (IL-4). In an in vitro analysis of T lymphocyte proliferation to KLH on week 4, the splenocytes of mice treated with KLH + KML-C showed a significantly higher proliferating activity than those treated with KLH alone. In addition, mice immunized twice with KLH + KML-C and followed by intrafootpad (i.f.) injection of KLH (50 micrograms/site) 14 weeks after the primary immunization induced a higher delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction than mice treated with KLH alone. These results suggest that KML-C is a potent immunoadjuvant to enhance cellular and humoral immune responses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Biomedical Research, Han Dong University, Namsong-Ri 3, Buk-ku, Pohang, Kyungbook 791-940, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoo", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "T B", "Initials": "TB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Her", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Azuma", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Int Immunopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "100965259", "ISSNLinking": "1567-5769"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin Isotypes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toxins, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ribosome inactivating protein, Viscum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9013-72-3", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemocyanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FV4Y0JO2CX", "NameOfSubstance": "keyhole-limpet hemocyanin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Antibody Formation"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Hemocyanins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity, Delayed"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Immunity, Cellular"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin Isotypes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Toxins, Biological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11379043", "10.1016/s1567-5769(01)00024-8", "S1567-5769(01)00024-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
