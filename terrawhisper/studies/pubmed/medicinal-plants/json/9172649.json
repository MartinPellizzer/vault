The experimentally determined thermodynamic parameters are compared with calculations using thermodynamic databases used for prediction of RNA structure. The 5S rRNA molecules which show minor differences in the nucleotide sequence display very different thermal unfolding profiles (DSC profiles). Numerical deconvolution of DSC profiles provided information about structural transformations that take place in both 5S rRNA molecules. A comparative analysis of DSC data and the theoretical thermodynamic models of the structure was used to establish a relationship between the constituting transitions found in the melting profiles and the unfolding of structural domains of the 5S rRNA and stability of its particular helical elements. Increased concentrations of Mg2+ ions induces additional internal interactions stabilising 5S rRNA structures found at low Na+ concentrations. Observed conformational transitions suggest a structural model in which the extension of helical region E dominates over the postulated tertiary interaction between hairpin loops. We propose that helix E is stabilised by a sequence of non-standard pairings extending this helix by the formation of tetra loop e and an almost total reduction of loop d between helices E and D. Two hairpin structures in both 5S rRNA molecules: the extended C-C' and the extended E-E'-E\" hairpins appear as the most stable elements of the structure. The cooperativity of the unfolding of helixes in these 5S rRNA molecules changes already at 2 mM Mg2+."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznan, Poland. tadkul@ibch.poznan.pl"}], "LastName": "Kuli\u0144ski", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bratek-Wiewi\u00f3rowska", "ForeName": "M D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zielenkiewicz", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zielenkiewicz", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biomol Struct Dyn", "NlmUniqueID": "8404176", "ISSNLinking": "0739-1102"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 5S"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I38ZP9992A", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nucleic Acid Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 5S"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9172649", "10.1080/07391102.1997.10508148"]}}]}
