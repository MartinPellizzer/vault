Compound <b>1</b> represents an unusual benzophenone-diketopiperazine hybrid via a thioether linker, while compound <b>2</b> contains a naturally rare sulfoxide group. Both compounds <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> were initially isolated as racemic mixtures and then purified as the enantiomerically pure (+)-<b>2</b>, (-)-<b>2</b>, (+)-<b>3</b>, and (-)-<b>3</b>, respectively. Their structures, including absolute configurations, were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, X-ray diffraction, and the calculations of electronic circular dichroism. The antioxidant activity of compounds <b>1</b>-<b>9</b> was evaluated based on oxygen radical absorbance capacity, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging, and the protective effect on the PC12 cell line against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced damage. Compounds <b>5</b>-<b>7</b> and <b>9</b> showed radical-scavenging activity against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radicals with the IC<sub>50</sub> values of 3.45 \u00b1 0.02, 23.73 \u00b1 0.08, 18.90 \u00b1 0.16, and 17.27 \u00b1 0.15 \u03bcM, respectively. Compounds (\u00b1)-<b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b> exhibited potent antioxidant capacity with oxygen radical absorbance capacity values of 1.73 \u00b1 0.13, 1.65 \u00b1 0.03, 6.14 \u00b1 0.35, and 1.55 \u00b1 0.04 \u03bcmol TE/\u03bcmol, respectively.
