This study is aimed at providing up-to-date information on the phytochemical composition and pharmacological uses of Chrysobalanus icaco. Current literature on the Chrysobalanus species was obtained by searching electronic databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science. Of the species in this genus, four have been reported in the literature, but only one (C. icaco) has been extensively studied. C. icaco is rich in several minerals, including potassium, magnesium, calcium and sodium. The plant also contains a host of phytochemicals, such as flavonoids, diterpenes and triterpenes, which have been shown to have pharmacological activity. It can be concluded that C. icaco is a good source of phytochemicals that contribute to its therapeutic uses. However, bioassay-guided isolation of its bioactive compounds is necessary for promoting the development of drugs from this medicinal plant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Shanghai Changhai Hospital.
