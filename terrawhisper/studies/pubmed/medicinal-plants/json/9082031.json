Seventy-five male Sprague-Dawley rats, age 90 d, were randomly divided into five treatment groups and were fed cholesterol-containing diets for 21 d. Diets included 10% cellulose (control); 5 or 10% psyllium stored 8 mo at 5 degrees C (PS5); or 5 or 10% psyllium stored 8 mo at 40 degrees C (PS40). The higher storage temperature caused a gradual decrease in molecular weight of the psyllium, as measured by changes in solution viscosity. Hepatic rates of sterol synthesis were significantly (P < 0.001) higher in all of the psyllium-fed rats compared with control rats [21 +/- 2, 312 +/- 35, 464 +/- 40, 328 +/- 49 and 439 +/- 57 nmol [3H]digitonin-precipitable sterol (DPS)/(g liver x h), respectively, for control, 5% PS5, 10% PS5, 5% PS40 and 10% PS40]. A similar trend was observed in intestinal rates of sterol synthesis, and the difference was significant (P < 0.05) for all treatment groups except the 5% PS5-fed group compared with the control group. Liver total cholesterol and total lipid concentrations were significantly lower in all psyllium-fed rats compared with controls. There were no significant differences in serum total cholesterol concentrations among the psyllium-fed groups, although serum cholesterol levels in both the PS5-fed groups were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that in the control group (2.66 +/- 0.18, 2.62 +/- 0.15 and 3.26 +/- 0.12 mmol/L, respectively, for 5% PS5, 10% PS5 and control). Serum triglyceride and HDL cholesterol concentrations did not vary significantly among groups. The findings of this study indicate that the cholesterol-lowering activity of psyllium is unaltered by storage conditions shown to cause a moderate degree of hydrolysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Illinois at Chicago, 60612, USA."}], "LastName": "Arjmandi", "ForeName": "B H", "Initials": "BH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sohn", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Juma", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Murthy", "ForeName": "S R", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Daggy", "ForeName": "B P", "Initials": "BP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8063-16-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Psyllium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intestine, Small"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Psyllium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viscosity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9082031", "10.1093/jn/127.3.463"]}}]}
