The fast growing period of plant was advanced with the increase of the density, while the duration of fast growing period was decreased. Individual biomass decreased with the increase of the density, while population biomass increased. Biomass proportion of root, stem and leaf in individual were 65.02%, 19.55% and 15.43% respectively.
