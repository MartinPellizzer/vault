Cells were divided in to five groups: group control, group VEGF, group CSI 50, group CSI 10 and group CSI 2 (supplemented with none cytokine, VEGF 10 ng x mL(-1), CSI 50, 10, 2 microg x mL(-1), respectively). After six days in culture, cell clusters were viewed with an inverted microscope, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of PE-CD34 and FITC-VE-Cadherin was performed to detect number of EPCs, adhesion assay was performed by replating cells on fibronectin coated dishes, and then counting adherent cells.", "Numbers of EPCs of group VEGF, group CSI 10 and group CSI 2 were significantly increased as compared with those of group control ( P < 0.01, P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively), and numbers of EPCs of group CSI 2 were more than those of group CSI 10 and group V (P < 0.01). Compared with group control, number of EPCs of group CSI 50 was significantly decreased (P < 0.01). Compared with group control, numbers of clusters and adhesive EPCs of group CSI 10 and group CSI 2 were significantly increased, while those of group CSI 50 were significantly decreased.", "Low concentration CSI can significantly promote EPCs augmentation and enhance its functional activity, while high concentration CSI significantly restrains it."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, Wenzhou 325000, China. jktdtl@sohu.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Kang-Ting", "Initials": "KT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Huai-Qin", "Initials": "HQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Peng-Lin", "Initials": "PL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hai-Ying", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "De-Ye", "Initials": "DY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Yan", "Initials": "XY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelium, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Fetal Blood"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Stem Cells"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16573010"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
