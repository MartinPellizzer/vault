It is initiated by the accumulation of cholesterol-laden macrophages in the artery wall, thereby forming the foam-cells, the hallmark of AS. Increased influx of oxidized LDL and decreased efflux of free cholesterol from macrophages constitute major factors that mediate the progression of AS. Natural compounds treatment and prevention of AS being an effective approach for a long time. Currently, as interests in medicinally important natural products increased that including medicinal herbs, numerous studies on natural compounds effective forAS have been reported. In the current review, we shed light on the available plant-based natural compounds as AS modulators with underlying mechanisms that may lead to potential therapeutic implications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Discipline of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Indore (IITI), Simrol, Indore, India. suraj.parihar@uct.ac.za."}], "LastName": "Saqib", "ForeName": "Uzma", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Health Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Qassim University, Buraydah, Saudi Arabia. suraj.parihar@uct.ac.za."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Masood A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Discipline of Biosciences and Biomedical Engineering (BSBE), Indian Institute of Technology Indore (IITI), Simrol, Indore, India. suraj.parihar@uct.ac.za."}], "LastName": "Alagumuthu", "ForeName": "Manikandan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Infectious Diseases Research in Africa (CIDRI-Africa) and Institute of Infectious Diseases and Molecular Medicine (IDM), Division of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa. suraj.parihar@uct.ac.za."}], "LastName": "Parihar", "ForeName": "Suraj P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Discipline of Biosciences and Biomedical Engineering (BSBE), Indian Institute of Technology Indore (IITI), Simrol, Indore, India. suraj.parihar@uct.ac.za."}], "LastName": "Baig", "ForeName": "Mirza S", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticholesteremic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "oxidized low density lipoprotein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anticholesteremic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Atherosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Foam Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "17"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34817349", "10.14715/cmb/2021.67.1.27"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
