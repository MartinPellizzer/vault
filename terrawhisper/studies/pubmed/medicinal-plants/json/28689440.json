In this study, chemical composition and in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of the essential oil from Salvia mirzayanii were investigated. The chemical constituents of essential oil from S mirzayanii were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antimicrobial activity was determined by broth microdilution. The main identified compounds were 1,8-cineole (41.2 \u00b1 1.3%), linalool acetate (11.0 \u00b1 0.5%), and \u03b1-terpinyl acetate (6.0 \u00b1 0.4%) (mL of essential oil/g of plant material). The MIC<sub>95</sub> were 0.03 to 0.5 \u00b5L/mL and 16 to 128 \u00b5L/mL for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. These results indicated that Salvia mirzayanii essential oil significantly inhibited the growth of standard and clinically isolated tested yeasts by MIC<sub>50</sub> 0.03 to 1 \u00b5L/mL. Potent antibacterial and antifungal activities of Salvia mirzayanii essential oil may be considered in future study, particularly against antibiotic-resistant cases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Medicinal Plants Processing Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Department of Medical Mycology and Parasitology, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zomorodian", "ForeName": "Kamiar", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Medicinal Plants Processing Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moein", "ForeName": "Mahmoodreza", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Department of Medical Mycology and Parasitology, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4 Center of Basic Sciences in Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Pakshir", "ForeName": "Keyvan", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Medicinal Plants Processing Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "5 Central Research Laboratory, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Karami", "ForeName": "Forough", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Medicinal Plants Processing Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sabahi", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Evid Based Complementary Altern Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101556804", "ISSNLinking": "2156-5899"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D81QY6I88E", "NameOfSubstance": "linalool"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NIT9SZT3D7", "NameOfSubstance": "terpinyl acetate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RV6J6604TK", "NameOfSubstance": "Eucalyptol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Eucalyptol"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Negative Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Positive Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salvia"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</b> The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Nazzaro F, Fratianni F, De Martino L, Coppola R, De Feo V.
