In the present study, we tested the possible antiinflammatory effects of a crude saponin extract (CSE) and a saponin's purified extracts (SPE) of Hedera helix in carrageenan- and cotton-pellet-induced acute and chronic inflammation models in rats. Both the CSE and SPE of Hedera helix were found to have antiinflammatory effects. The most potent drug screened was indomethacin (89.2% acute antiinflammatory effect), while the most potent extract screened was the CSE of Hedera helix at 100 and 200 mg/kg body wt. doses with 77% acute antiinflammatory effects. For testing chronic antiinflammatory (antiproliferative) effects, the cotton-pellet-granuloma test was conducted. Indomethacin was found to be the most potent drug in the chronic phase of inflammation, with 66% effect. The SPE of Hedera helix was more potent than the CSE in its chronic antiinflammatory effect (60% and 49%, respectively)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atat\u00fcrk University, Medical Faculty, Department of Pharmacology, Erzurum, Turkey. suleyman@atauni.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00fcleyman", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mshvildadze", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gepdiremen", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elias", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Phytomedicine", "NlmUniqueID": "9438794", "ISSNLinking": "0944-7113"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hedera"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12834000", "10.1078/0944-7113-00260", "S0944-7113(04)70235-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
