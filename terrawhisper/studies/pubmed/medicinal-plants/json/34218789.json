Herbal medicines are a promising choice over modern synthetic drugs because of their low side effects and are thus considered to be safe and effective in treating human diseases. Lagenaria siceraria (Mol.) Standley fruit (Bottle gourd) belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family that has been used in a different system of traditional medication to treat various diseases. This is a domestic plant that provides food as well as medication. This vegetable have low caloric values and high water contents. The edible portion of it contains phytochemicals like vitamins, proteins, choline, minerals, terpenoids, flavonoids, etc. Several bioactive compounds have been isolated from L. siceraria, including triterpenoids, sterols, cucurbitacins, flavones, C-glycosides and \u03b2-glycosides. Researchers have evaluated various parts of this plant viz. fruit, root, flowers, and leaves for pharmacological activities like antianxiety, antidepressant, diuretic, antimicrobial, cytotoxic, antihyperlipidemic, cardio protective, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anthelmintic, anti-hyperglycemic, antihepatotoxic, anti-urolithiatic, antistress, antiulcer, anticancer, hepatoprotective, anthelmintic, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant. In this review, an attempt has been made to explore its phytochemical constituents, traditional, medicinal, and pharmacological uses to highlight the therapeutic importance of this well-known plant. This would be helpful in reviving its importance and will highlight its several promising aspects to encourage researchers for further research on L. siceraria."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Malakand at Chakdara, Dir Lower, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Zahoor", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, Mardan, 23200, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ikram", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Malakand at Chakdara, Dir Lower, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Nazir", "ForeName": "Nausheen", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Malakand at Chakdara, Dir Lower, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Naz", "ForeName": "Sumaira", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Damanhour University, Damanhour 22511, AlBeheira, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Batiha", "ForeName": "Gaber El-Saber", "Initials": "GE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Malakand, Chakdara, Dir Lower, 18800, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Kamran", "ForeName": "Abdul Waheed", "Initials": "AW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departament of Pharmacognosy, Medical University of Bialystok, ul.
