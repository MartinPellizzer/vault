Then, 500-700 mg of each sample was pelletized under a pressure of six tones and irradiated together with monitors for alpha and neutron flux ratio determinations for about 6 h in a thermal flux of 2.29 x 10(12) n/cm2/s. The accuracy of the method was established by analyzing standard reference materials. Twenty-nine elements, Ag, As, Au, Ba, Br, Ca, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Eu, Fe, Hf, K, La, Mn, Mo, Na, Rb, Sb, Sc, Se, Sm, Sr, Th, U, Yb, and Zn, were measured in all the samples, and Hg was detected in some samples, with good accuracy and reproducibility. The concentration of elements determined was found to vary depending on the composition of the herbs used. Although the trend linking the element of the medicinal plants to its curative abilities could not be clearly determined, this study showed that the toxic elements found in the samples were below the levels prescribed by health regulations. Nevertheless, such data are important to understand the pharmacological action and the exact mechanisms of action and formation of active constituents for each medicinal plant and to decide the dosage of the herbs used in the final formulation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Science, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sarmani", "ForeName": "S B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abugassa", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hamzah", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yahya", "ForeName": "M D", "Initials": "MD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biol Trace Elem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7911509", "ISSNLinking": "0163-4984"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Neutron Activation Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10676512", "10.1007/BF02784224"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
