This study investigated the effect of <i>A. tripedale</i> plant against acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver damage. After preliminary studies, the <i>A. tripedale</i> methanol fraction (ATMF) was selected for <i>in vivo</i> study. Thirty-six rats were divided into six groups of 6 each and treated by gavage as follows: groups 1 and 2 received normal saline; group 3 received 400 mg/kg of ATMF; and groups 4-6 were treated with 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg of ATMF, respectively. After two consecutive weeks, except groups 1 and 3, rats were administered with an oral single dose of APAP (2 g/kg). After 48 h, blood and liver samples were collected for histological and biochemical examinations. The results showed that APAP caused a significant increase in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase serum levels, lipid peroxidation (all with <i>P</i> < 0.001) and hepatic nitric oxide (<i>P</i> < 0.01). In addition, APAP led to the depletion of the total antioxidant capacity, total thiol group (both with <i>P</i> < 0.001), and structural alterations in the hepatic tissue. Following administration of ATMF extract, a significant improvement was observed in the functional and oxidative stress markers of hepatic tissue alongside histopathologic changes. In conclusion, the present study showed that the administration of ATMF might prevent hepatic oxidative damage by improving oxidant/antioxidant balance in animals exposed to APAP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2019 Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, I.R.
