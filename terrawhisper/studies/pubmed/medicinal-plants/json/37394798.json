In Western India, various parts of the <i>Dalbergia sissoo</i> plant, which belongs to the <i>Fabaceae</i> family, have been traditionally used to treat different types of cancer by the local tribes. However, this claim has not been scientifically proven yet. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the antioxidant (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity) and anticancer effects of different plant extracts from Dalbergia sissoo bark, root, and branch on six different cancer cell lines (K562, PC3, A431, A549, NCIH 460, and HEK 293\u2009T) using <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. The study also involved <i>in silico</i> docking, MD simulation, and ADME studies of previously reported bioactive compounds from the same parts of the plant to confirm their bioactivity. The DPPH radical scavenging experiment findings showed that the methanol: water extract of the bark had a more significant antioxidant activity IC<sub>50</sub> (45.63\u2009\u00b1\u20091.24\u2009mg/mL). Furthermore, the extract prevented the growth of the A431, A549, and NCIH 460 cancer cell lines with the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> values of 15.37, 29.09, and 17.02\u2009g/mL, respectively, demonstrating remarkable anticancer potential. Molecular docking and dynamic simulation studies revealed that Prunetin, Tectorigenin, and Prunetin 4'-O-Galactoside show efficient binding to the EGFR binding domain. This study suggests that tested hits may have antioxidant and anticancer agents and can be considered for future applications in the pharma sector.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
