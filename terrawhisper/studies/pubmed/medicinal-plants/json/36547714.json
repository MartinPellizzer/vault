The current paper investigated the impacts of mining activities of Pb-Zn sulfide on soil and medicinal plants. Hence, soil samples (n\u2009=\u200936) and medicinal plants (n\u2009=\u200936) samples were collected, acid extracted and were analyzed through Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) for HMs quantification. Our results showed that mineralized zones showed high HMs enrichment levels as compared to non-mineralized zones. Various Indices for HMs assessment revealed that the contaminated soil of the study area had low to extreme level. The mean concentrations of HMs in mining degraded soil and medicinal plants were significantly higher (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01) and were found in order of Zn\u2009>\u2009Pb\u2009>\u2009Cr\u2009>\u2009Ni\u2009>\u2009Cd and Cr\u2009>\u2009Zn\u2009>\u2009Pb\u2009>\u2009Ni\u2009>\u2009Cd respectively. Similarly, some widely consumable medicinal plants showed good metal accumulation for Cd, Cr and Pb i.e., 3.57\u00a0mg kg<sup>1</sup>, 350\u00a0mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and 335\u00a0mg kg<sup>-1</sup> in C. sativa, while 5.9\u00a0mg kg-1, 276.9\u00a0mg kg-1 and 188.7\u00a0mg kg-1 in R. hestatus respectively. Hence, the present study recommended that medicinal plants grown in mining areas should be analyzed for HMs concentration before consumption."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022.
