The questionnaire link was circulated for 6 weeks (April-May, 2021). The questionnaire was structured to gather socio-economic data, lifestyles of the participants (especially younger adults) and changes in dietary intake and health. Descriptive statistics and Pearson's correlation were used to define the proportion of responses for each question and check for association.", "No glaring nutrition or health problems was observed in the surveyed population (385 respondents), but many (50%) earned very low monthly income (< 50 000 naira). A drop in finances seemed to have indirectly caused a decrease in food consumption post-lockdown. A strong association between age and health risks was observed; similarly, alcohol intake was significantly affected by income and age.", "The pandemic caused many changes in people's dietary habits and lifestyles, including financial setbacks.
