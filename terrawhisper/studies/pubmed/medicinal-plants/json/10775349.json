The isolated compounds were identified as coptisine, jatrorrizhine, berberine, and magnoflorine by a combination of spectroscopic studies using UV-visible, IR, mass-spectrometry, and NMR. Coptisine, jatrorrizhine, and berberine isolated from Coptis japonica Makino showed strong antiphotooxidative activity in the chlorophyll-sensitized photooxidation of linoleic acid. However, these compounds did not show either inhibitory activity against lipid peroxidation in rat liver microsomes nor DPPH radical scavenging activity, indicating that their antiphotooxidative activity was not due to the radical chain reaction breaking ability but due to singlet oxygen quenching activity. Commercially available authentic protoberberines (berberine chloride and palmatine chloride) also showed strong antioxidative activity in the chlorophyll-sensitized photooxidation of linoleic acid. The antiphotooxidative activities of the berberine chloride and palmatine chloride were significantly higher than that of ascorbyl palmitate in the chlorophyll-sensitized photooxidation of linoleic acid. These results clearly showed for the first time the antiphotooxidative properties of protoberberines in chlorophyll-sensitized photooxidation of oil."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Chungnam National University, Taejeon, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "M Y", "Initials": "MY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S Y", "Initials": "SY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0I8Y3P32UF", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10775349", "10.1021/jf9909297", "jf9909297"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
