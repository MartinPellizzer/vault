As such, herbal products from <i>Antidesma bunius</i> (L.) Spreng., locally known as bignay, are popular as medicine for various ailments of the circulatory and digestive systems. Though efficacy is guaranteed, the authenticity of the marketed products is still in question as several other herbal plants can provide the said benefits. Similar morphology between wild species also hinders species identification and contributes confusion especially to the general consumer. The authenticity of the marketed HMPs was established by means of DNA barcoding techniques which offers quick and reliable species identification by means of (1) the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTn) and (2) the establishment of the first Standard Reference Material (SRM) Herbal barcode library for <i>Antidesma</i> spp. A total of 56 gene accessions from <i>mat</i>K-<i>psb</i>A-<i>trn</i>H-<i>rbc</i>L sequences of 9 wild <i>Antidesma</i> spp. comprised the SRM which was then used to confirm the identity of 11 randomly sampled bignay-derived HMPs. Following the BLASTn and the SRM (maximum likelihood tree reconstruction) criterion, the subjected sequences revealed that only three of the 11 HMPs were authentic <i>A. bunius</i>-derived products. The other eight HMPs contained substitutes that were either fillers or different herbal medicinal plant not indicated in the product labels. These results indicate that product safety should be reinforced with complete HMP authentication using traditional methods supported by molecular data."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, University of Santo Tomas, Manila, Philippines."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Sciences Laboratory, Research Center for the Natural and Applied Sciences, Thomas Aquinas Research Center, University of Santo Tomas, Manila, Philippines."}], "LastName": "Alfeche", "ForeName": "Ni\u00f1a Kathryn G", "Initials": "NKG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Sciences Laboratory, Research Center for the Natural and Applied Sciences, Thomas Aquinas Research Center, University of Santo Tomas, Manila, Philippines."}], "LastName": "Binag", "ForeName": "Sam Dominic A", "Initials": "SDA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biological Sciences Department and University Research Office, De La Salle University - Dasmarinas, Cavite, Philippines."}], "LastName": "Medecilo", "ForeName": "Maria Melanie P", "Initials": "MMP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, University of Santo Tomas, Manila, Philippines."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Sciences Laboratory, Research Center for the Natural and Applied Sciences, Thomas Aquinas Research Center, University of Santo Tomas, Manila, Philippines."}], "LastName": "Alejandro", "ForeName": "Grecebio Jonathan D", "Initials": "GJD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "101485040", "ISSNLinking": "1944-0057"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Euphorbiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Library"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31596175", "10.1080/19440049.2019.1670868"]}}]}
