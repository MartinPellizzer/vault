Therefore, new drugs to treat fungal infections are urgently needed. In this line, our study aimed to determine the anticandidal activity and the synergistic effect of essential oil fractions from Syzygium aromaticum, Cymbopogon citratus and Aeollanthus heliotropioides harvested in Cameroon using a combination approach. Essential oils have been obtained by hydrodistillation and their chemical composition was analysed by GC/MS. Antifungal activity was evaluated by the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using a micro-dilution method. The sorbitol and ergosterol binding ability and anti-biofilm activity were also assessed in order to evaluate the mode of action. The crude essential oils showed a good anticandidal activity, most probably due to the eugenol, linalool and citral content. The combination of two fractions F7 and F10 showed an improved growth inhibition of Candida spp compared to the crude essential oils. The inhibitory effect could be related with the presence of \u03b3-dodecalactone and citronellol as main compounds. The best synergistic combination F7F10 inhibited biofilm formation at ten time reduced combination MIC. The active fractions targeted different fungal cell structures, including cell wall and membrane. Our study showed that the combination of selected essential oils fractions exhibited an increased antifungal activity against Candida spp compared to the crude essential oils. The combination approach of inner compound groups may be used as a promising strategy for the development of efficient recombined micro-essential oils as antifungal agents to face Candida resistance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.
