Male Wistar rats were divided into control and crataegus group (for which the standard diet was mixed with a 2% crataegus powder standardized to 2.2% flavonoids). The investigations started 3 months after commencing the treatment. The hearts were isolated and a retrograde perfusion was performed at constant pressure according to the technique of Langendorff. The experimental protocol comprised 10 min equilibration, according to the technique of Langendorff. The experimental protocol comprised 10 min equilibration, according to the technique of Langendorff. The experimental protocol comprised 10 min equilibration, 110 min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and 30 min reperfusion. The coronary effluent was sampled for the LDH determination after 5, 30, 90, 120 and 150 min. The LDH activity, which was initially very low in both groups (control, 16.5 +/- 4.3; crataegus, 26.0 +/- 8.8 mU/min) increased slightly during the ischemia, and very strongly as soon as the heart was reperfused. However, the increase in the crataegus group was significantly lower (1777.3 +/- 451.9 vs control 3795.3 +/- 511.9 mU/min, p = 0.01). At the end of the reperfusion period, LDH activity decreased markedly but did not reach the ischemic values. The attenuation of the LDH release by crataegus pretreatment suggests a preservation of the cell membrane and a protection from myocardial damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Physiology II, University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Al Makdessi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sweidan", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "M\u00fcllner", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jacob", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Arzneimittelforschung", "NlmUniqueID": "0372660", "ISSNLinking": "0004-4172"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Powders"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Powders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8821513"]}}]}
