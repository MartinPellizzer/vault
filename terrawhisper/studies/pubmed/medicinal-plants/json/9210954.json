A long-term goal of our laboratory is to elucidate the molecular mechanism or mechanism by which apigenin inhibits skin tumorigenesis. In a previous publication, we characterized the mechanism by which apigenin induced G2/M arrest in keratinocytes. More recent studies in our laboratory have provided evidence that apigenin can induce G1 arrest in addition to arresting cells at G2/M. Here we describe the mechanism of the apigenin-induced G1 arrest in human diploid fibroblasts (HDF). Treatment of asynchronous HDF for 24 h with 10-50 microM apigenin resulted in dose-dependent cell-cycle arrest at both the G0/G1 and G2/M phases as measured by flow cytometry. The G0/G1 arrest was more clearly defined by using HDF that were synchronized in G0 and then released from quiescence by replating at subconfluent densities in medium containing 10-70 microM apigenin. The cells were analyzed for cell-cycle progression or cyclin D1 expression 24 h later. A dose of apigenin as low as 10 microM reduced the percentage of cells in S phase by 20% compared with control cultures treated with solvent alone. Western blot analysis of apigenin-treated HDF indicated that cyclin D1 was expressed at higher levels than in untreated cells, which signifies that they were arrested in G1 phase rather than in a G0 quiescent state. The G1 arrest was further studied by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) immune complex-kinase assays of apigenin-treated asynchronous HDF, which demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of cdk2 by apigenin. Inhibition of cdk2 kinase activity in apigenin-treated cells was associated with the accumulation of the hypophosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein as measured by western blot analysis. The cdk inhibitor p21/WAF1 was also induced in a dose-dependent manner, with a 22-fold induction of p21/WAF1 in 70 microM apigenin-treated cells. In conclusion, apigenin treatment produced a G1 cell-cycle arrest by inhibiting cdk2 kinase activity and the phosphorylation of Rb and inducing the cdk inhibitor p21/WAF1, all of which may mediate its chemopreventive activities in vivo. To our knowledge this is the first report of a chemopreventive agent inducing p21/WAF1, a known downstream effector of the p53 tumor suppressor protein."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eppley Institute for Cancer Research, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, USA."}], "LastName": "Lepley", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pelling", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA71041", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "CA72987", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Carcinog", "NlmUniqueID": "8811105", "ISSNLinking": "0899-1987"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CDKN1A protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.22", "NameOfSubstance": "CDC2-CDC28 Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.22", "NameOfSubstance": "CDK2 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.22", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.22", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclin-Dependent Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "CDC2-CDC28 Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chamomile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclin-Dependent Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "G1 Phase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "G2 Phase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Retinoblastoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Resting Phase, Cell Cycle"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9210954", "10.1002/(sici)1098-2744(199707)19:2<74::aid-mc2>3.0.co;2-l", "10.1002/(SICI)1098-2744(199707)19:2<74::AID-MC2>3.0.CO;2-L"]}}]}
