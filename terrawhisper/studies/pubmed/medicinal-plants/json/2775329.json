(mistletoe) cause a dose-dependent decrease of viability of human leukemia cell cultures, MOLT-4, after 72 h treatment. The LC50 of the partially purified lectin was 27.8 ng/ml, of the highly purified lectin 1.3 ng/ml. Compared to the highly purified lectin a 140-fold higher protein concentration of an aqueous mistletoe drug was required to obtain similar cytotoxic effects on MOLT-4 cells. Cytotoxicity of the highly purified lectin was preferentially inhibited by D-galactose and lactose, cytotoxicity of the mistletoe drug and the partially purified lectin were preferentially inhibited by lactose and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc). Two lectin fractions with almost the same cytotoxic activity on MOLT-4 cells but with different carbohydrate affinities were isolated by affinity chromatography from the mistletoe drug: mistletoe lectin I with an affinity to D-galactose and GalNAc and mistletoe lectin II with an affinity to GalNAc. The lectin fractions and the mistletoe drug inhibited protein synthesis of MOLT-4 cells stronger than DNA synthesis. Furthermore a subpopulation of MOLT-4, resistant to cytotoxic doses of both the mistletoe drug and the mistletoe lectins, was shown to exhibit a reduced amount of GalNAc and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in their cellular glycoproteins which are probably responsible for the binding of the cytotoxic lectins. These results indicate that lectins are the main toxins in the mistletoe drug."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Genetics, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Fed.
