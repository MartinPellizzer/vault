Willd. (Plantaginaceae) are important medicinal plants in Mexico used by indigenous people for their anti-inflammatory effects and to also reduce rheumatic pains.", "In addition to radical scavenging activity, the anti-inflammatory activity of the extracts, fractions and compounds of these plants were investigated and reported here for the first time.", "The anti-inflammatory activities of MeOH, CH(2)Cl(2), and ethyl acetate extracts and iridoid, flavonoids, and phenylpropanoids from Penstemon gentianoides and P. campanulatus were studied in the TPA-induced mouse ear edema model. In addition, antioxidant activity against DPPH, crocin and \u03b2-carotene were investigated.", "All extracts were tested and a selection of known compounds significantly (p <0.05) inhibited mouse ear edema. The results showed that CH(2)Cl(2) extracts of roots and stems from P. gentianoides and ethyl acetate extracts of leaves from P. gentianoides and P. campanulatus, as well as luteolin, diosmetin, penstemide and verbascoside produced the most positive results. Of all substances tested, the CH(2)Cl(2) extract of P. gentianoides roots was the most powerful inhibitor (ED(50)=0.07 mg/ear), with activity comparable to that of indomethacin. These extracts, compounds purified, as well as known compounds, inhibited oxidation of \u03b2-carotene and crocin.", "These findings showed that the iridoid monoterpenes, flavonoids and phenylpropanoids present in these plants species may all contribute to the observed anti-inflammatory activity. Additionally, the observed antioxidant activity is correlated with the anti-inflammatory activity of these plants and the phytochemicals derived from them."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemical Laboratory, Unidad de Biotecnologia y Prototipos (UBIPRO), FES-Iztacala, UNAM, Mexico City, Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dom\u00ednguez", "ForeName": "Mariana", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Avila", "ForeName": "Jose G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nieto", "ForeName": "Antonio", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "C\u00e9spedes", "ForeName": "Carlos L", "Initials": "CL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812552", "ISSNLinking": "1388-0209"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XXE1CET956", "NameOfSubstance": "Indomethacin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indomethacin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Iridoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Penstemon"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20979542", "10.3109/13880209.2010.503708"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
