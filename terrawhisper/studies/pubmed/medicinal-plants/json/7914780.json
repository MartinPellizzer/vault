Control consisted of chewing gum and practice groups. Both SRT and CRT were correlated with age. In the SRT task, reaction times were not different among the three groups studied. In the CRT task, only betel and chewing gum groups showed a significant shortening of reaction time, but the betel group had a higher degree of statistical significance in this effect. It is concluded that shortening of CRT from betel chewing is probably partly due to chewing itself and partly due to a cholinergic arousal mechanism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Chang Gung Medical College and Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."}], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "N S", "Initials": "NS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "J Formos Med Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9214933", "ISSNLinking": "0929-6646"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Habits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Reaction Time"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7914780"]}}]}
