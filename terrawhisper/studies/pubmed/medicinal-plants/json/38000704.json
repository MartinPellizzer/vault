This family contains zinc finger proteins, regulates the activation and suppression of transcription, and binds to DNA, RNA, and proteins. Klfs related to the immune system are Klf1, Klf2, Klf3, Klf4, Klf6, and Klf14. Klfs related to adipose tissue development and/or glucose metabolism are Klf3, Klf7, Klf9, Klf10, Klf11, Klf14, Klf15, and Klf16. Klfs related to cancer are Klf3, Klf4, Klf5, Klf6, Klf7, Klf8, Klf9, Klf10, Klf11, Klf12, Klf13, Klf14, Klf16, and Klf17. Klfs related to the cardiovascular system are Klf4, Klf5, Klf10, Klf13, Klf14, and Klf15. Klfs related to the nervous system are Klf4, Klf7, Klf8, and Klf9. Klfs are associated with diseases such as carcinogenesis, oxidative stress, diabetes, liver fibrosis, thalassemia, and the metabolic syndrome. The aim of this review is to provide information about the relationship of Klfs with some diseases and physiological events and to guide future studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
