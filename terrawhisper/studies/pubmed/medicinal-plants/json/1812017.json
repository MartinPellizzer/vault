It was observed that several betel nut samples were infested with aflatoxin-producing fungus, Aspergillus flavus. Out of 32 samples collected from various places, 12 were positive for aflatoxin. Aflatoxin B1 was detected in all the positive samples. Other aflatoxins were also detected in some samples. Boric acid, propionic acid and potassium metabisulphite were used for the control of aflatoxin B1 on betel nuts. Propionic acid was most effective in inhibiting aflatoxin production on betel nut after intervals of 2 (62%) and 4 (85%) weeks. Controlling the occurrence of aflatoxin could safeguard the users from the health hazards of aflatoxins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Preventive Toxicology Division, Industrial Toxicology Research Centre, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Raisuddin", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Misra", "ForeName": "J K", "Initials": "JK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Addit Contam", "NlmUniqueID": "8500474", "ISSNLinking": "0265-203X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Boric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Food Preservatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Propionates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "65OE787Q7W", "NameOfSubstance": "potassium metabisulfite"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JHU490RVYR", "NameOfSubstance": "propionic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R57ZHV85D4", "NameOfSubstance": "boric acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus flavus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Boric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Propionates"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfites"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1812017", "10.1080/02652039109374028"]}}]}
