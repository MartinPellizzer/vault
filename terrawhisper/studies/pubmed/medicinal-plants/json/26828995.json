Liver fibrosis model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of dimethyl nitrosamines (DMN) in rat. Rats in treatment group were administrated with different concentrations of DCP (0, 100, 300 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson's trichrome staining were used to assess histo-pathological change. \u03b1-SMA, TGF-\u03b21 and pSmad 2/3 were assayed by immuno-histochemistry. HSC-T6 cells were stimulated by recombined rat TGF-\u03b21 (1 ng/mL) to simulate an activating model in vitro and then interfered with DCP (concentration of 0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 \u00b5g/ml). MTT assay was used to determine cell proliferation and western blotting was used to detect \u03b1-SMA and pSmad 2/3 expression. Results demonstrated that DCP alleviated DMN-induced liver fibrosis in rat and significantly down-regulated TGF-\u03b21 expression, pSmad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA in liver tissue in a dose-dependent way. DCP inhibited proliferation and activation of TGF-\u03b21-stimulated HSC-T6 in vitro and significantly down-regulated \u03b1-SMA and pSmad2/3 expression. In conclusion, this study revealed that DCP attenuates progression of liver fibrosis through suppressing TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathway. DCP is a potential botanical polysaccharide to management liver fibrosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University GuangXi Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine in Liver Injury and Repair Guilin China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhuhai people's Hospital Department of Pathology Zhuhai China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guilin Medical University Department of Pathology, the Second affiliated Hospital Guilin China."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University GuangXi Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine in Liver Injury and Repair Guilin China shengjunxiao@sina.com."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Actins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smad Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transforming Growth Factor beta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M43H21IO8R", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acanthaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Actins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Down-Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatic Stellate Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Cirrhosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Smad Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transforming Growth Factor beta"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26828995"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
