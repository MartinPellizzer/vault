Now, some chemical synthetic fungicides have been frequently used to control the growth of fungi and accumulation of mycotoxins in the preservation of CHMs. However, the concentration and type of chemical fungicides allowed for postharvest application are restricted due to the disadvantages of their high residual toxicity, long degradation period and pollution to the environment and so on. Therefore, it is critical to research and develop some highly effective, safe and non-toxic, natural, environment-friendly fungistatic agents from plants to prevent CHMs from being contaminated by fungi and mycotoxins. The paper reviews mycotoxins and their harmfulness, the effective compounds of fungistatic plants as well as the antifungal mechanism to provide scientific evidences for developing novel and effective fungistatic agents plants. Then, the application prospect of fungistatic agents from plants in the preservation of CHMs was discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yan-jun", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Wei-jun", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Yi-chen", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Lian-hua", "Initials": "LH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Shi-hai", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Mei-hua", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mycotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mycotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Preservation, Biological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26975093"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
