Wistar albino rats were treated for seven consecutive days with selected doses of five commonly used herbs (Trigonella foenum-graecum, Ferula asafoetida, Nigella sativa, Commiphora myrrha and Lepidium sativum). Thereafter, rat livers were harvested and CYP2D mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR. The metabolic activity of CYP2D was performed on rat hepatic microsomes using dextromethorphan as specific substrate. All investigated herbs produced inhibition of CYP2D mRNA expression and metabolic activity. The inhibitory potential of investigated herbs on rat CYP2D mRNA was in the following order: Commiphora myrrha > Nigella sativa > Lepidium sativum > Trigonella foenum-graecum > Ferula asafoetida. Whereas, the inhibitory potential of investigated herbs on CYP2D mediated enzyme metabolic activity was found in following order: Nigella sativa > Lepidium sativum > Trigonella foenum-graecum > Commiphora myrrha > Ferula asafoetida. The current study shows that only used herbs reduce CYP2D activity in rat liver microsomes at the transcriptional levels. Such effects could lead to undesirable pharmacological effects of clinically used low therapeutic index CYP2D substrate drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Al-Jenoobi", "ForeName": "F I", "Initials": "FI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Korashy", "ForeName": "H M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ahad", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Raish", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Al-Mohizea", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alam", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Al-Suwayeh", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alkharfy", "ForeName": "K M", "Initials": "KM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Pharmazie", "NlmUniqueID": "9800766", "ISSNLinking": "0031-7144"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "63231-63-0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "RNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25985573"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
