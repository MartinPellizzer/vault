In contrast to the Caribbean area in general, population size of Bimini, Bahamas has stabilized since 1963. The following information was obtained for the sample of 1218 of the islanders: birthdate; birthplace; residence; nationality; occupation; age at menarche; age at 1st marriage; live births; reproductive wastage (abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth); contraceptive usage; child spacing; reported diseases and illnesses; and regularly taken medications. Contributing to the recent stabilization and decline in population size on Bimini is a reduction in natality. Since 1964 the crude birthrate has declined, and the current rate of 20.512 is close to the lowest ever recorded in the Caribbean. The crude death rate decreased during the 1973-1977 period to 6.5/1000, a rate higher than the Bahamas as a whole but relatively low among the tabulated Caribbean population. Current statistics on fertility illustrate several additional elements in the ongoing regulation of population size. Comparatively late ages at menarche and marriage have shortened the reproductive career of the average Bimini female. The rapidly increasing employment of birth control tablets represents a new trend in health-related behavior since neither contraceptives nor abortifacients are found among Bimini's medicinal plants. The \"modern\" forms of contraception have markedly affected fertility in the Caribbean for several years."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["803766", "00084900"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: HUMAN BIOLOGY; AN INTERNATIONAL RECORD OF RESEARCH."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Age Distribution", "Age Factors", "Americas", "Bahamas--history", "Birth Rate", "Caribbean", "Contraception", "Contraceptive Usage", "Demographic Analysis", "Demographic Factors", "Demography", "Developing Countries", "Economic Factors", "Family Planning", "Fertility", "Fertility Measurements", "Geographic Factors", "Mortality--statistics", "North America", "Population", "Population Characteristics", "Population Dynamics", "Population Growth", "Research Methodology", "Residence Characteristics", "Sex Distribution", "Sex Factors", "Social Sciences", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Spatial Distribution"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "7450729", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1981", "Month": "03", "Day": "17"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2011", "Month": "04", "Day": "18"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0018-7143", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "52", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1980", "Month": "Sep"}}, "Title": "Human biology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Hum Biol"}, "ArticleTitle": "Population regulation in an island community.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "479", "EndPage": "498", "MedlinePgn": "479-98"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Halberstein", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Hum Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0116717", "ISSNLinking": "0018-7143"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bahamas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Demography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Marriage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Morbidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mortality"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Dynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Ratio"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7450729"]}}]}
