The protein and magnesium contents were found to be in inverse ratio to the age of cells. The molar weight distribution of the protein content shifted with age towards fractions with larger molar weights because of the reduced rate of protein synthesis of the ribosomes. The deactivation of the ribosomes is caused by a decrease in the number of polyribosomes. The lowered concentration of magnesium is responsible for this structural change of the ribosomes (depolymerization). The restoration of the polymer structure is thought to be due to the stimulation of protein synthesis brought about by the introduction of exogenous magnesium. Magnesium has an influence not only on the ribosome structure but also on the biosynthesis of some hormones involved in protein synthesis (gibberellines, auxins, cytokinins). The activity of the catalase enzyme is also increased by the rising level of magnesium, which has a protective effect on auxins. It can thus be established that magnesium exercises a direct influence on juvenility by stabilizing the polyribosome structure, and an indirect effect by increasing hormone and enzyme activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Borsodi Vegyi Kombin\u00e1t, Kazincbarcika, Hungary."}], "LastName": "Kiss", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Magnes Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8900948", "ISSNLinking": "0953-1424"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gibberellins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5712ZB110R", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorophyll b"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I38ZP9992A", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Gibberellins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3275205"]}}]}
