The aim of this study is to identify, catalog, and report the traditional medicinal uses of plants in this province, where every living thing and many natural objects around it are regarded as sacred, with a scientific ethnobotanical approach. The field study was completed between May 2016 and July 2023. The collection of plant excursion and plant usage information was implemented in two stages; in the first stage, a survey about the collection and the uses of medicinal plants was conducted. At this stage, plant samples were collected by visiting 49 villages of the district and performing face-to-face interviews with 112 participants (51 female and 61 male). In the second stage, the usage statistics related to the data obtained from the field studies were determined. For this reason, every informant was interviewed at least twice, people who were previously interviewed were included too. In the course of this study, interviews from 211 participants (95 female and 116 male) were analyzed. As a result of analysis, the traditional medicinal uses of 120 plants belonging to 48 families were identified. The most taxa are identified from the Asteraceae (15), Rosaceae (13), Fabaceae (8), Lamiaceae (8), and Apiaceae (6) families.
