Allergic reactions are the main reason behind asthma which is known as an important health problem with a high rate of morbidity and mortality in patients with respiratory diseases. Liquorice, the root of Glycyrrhiza, is primarily effective for asthma which is widely used in herbal medicine. In the present study, we designed nano-particles that carry Glycyrrhizic acid as the effective component of Liquorice. After Poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolic acid) PLGA nanoparticle preparation and Glycyrrhizic acid loading, the morphology of the nanoparticle, the electric charge distribution, and drug-releasing ability were studied. Then the effect of Glycyrrhizic acid-PLGA on the animal model of allergic asthma was investigated. Glycyrrhizic acid-nanoparticle had a mean\u00b1SD size of 350\u00b150 nm. about 67% of the effective component was released after 10 h. The interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-25 levels and the Muc5ac mRNA expression were decreased in the Glycyrrhizic acid-PLGA treated group. In addition, a significant decline was observed in goblet cell hyperplasia, mucus hyper-secretion, and eosinophilic inflammation around bronchi and vessels of the nano-drug treated group, compared with the asthmatic group. We found that Glycyrrhizic acid-PLGA nanoparticle had an anti-asthma effect which may be used as a new drug to cure asthma. It can prevent bronchial obstruction, breathlessness, and asthma attacks."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Ningxia Medical University (The First People's Hospital of Yinchuan), Yinchuan, China.
