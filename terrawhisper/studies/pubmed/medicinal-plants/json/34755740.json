This study aimed to investigate DSM's anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) properties and possible molecular mechanisms. Hep3B and HCCLM3 cells were selected to evaluate the anti-HCC properties of DSM <i>in vitro</i>. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to identify the possible molecular targets and pathways. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to evaluate the effect of DSM treatment on the primary metabolites of HCCLM3 cells. Tumor xenograft was performed in nude mice to examine the anti-HCC properties of DSM <i>in vivo</i>. The results showed that DSM inhibited the proliferation and migration of HCC cells <i>in vitro</i> in a dose-dependent manner. RNA-seq identified 4459 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were highly enriched in the cell cycle pathway. In addition, DSM regulated cell growth by arresting the cell cycle in the G1 phase by decreasing the expression of BCL2, CDK1, and CCND1. Furthermore, metabolomics analysis revealed that DSM interfered with the lipid metabolism pathway of HCC cells by significantly inhibiting the synthesis of metabolites, such as acetic acid, decanoic acid, glycerol, and L-proline. Subcutaneous tumor formation experiments revealed that DSM significantly reduced the tumor volume and weight when compared to the control. Immunohistochemical analysis further revealed that DSM treatment significantly decreased the expression of the proliferative marker KI67. Our findings demonstrated that DSM exhibited antitumor effects on HCC cells by inhibiting cell proliferation <i>via</i> cell cycle arrest and interfering with lipid metabolism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2788-8455"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Innovation and Attracting Talents \"111\" base, Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, College of Bioengineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China. lilywang@cqu.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Key Laboratory of Development and Utilization of Genuine Medicinal Materials in Three Gorges Reservoir Area, Chongqing Engineering Research Center of Antitumor Natural Drugs, Chongqing Three Gorges Medical College, Chongqing 400030, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Lianhong", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Innovation and Attracting Talents \"111\" base, Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, College of Bioengineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China. lilywang@cqu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Fan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Innovation and Attracting Talents \"111\" base, Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, College of Bioengineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China. lilywang@cqu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jiaqin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Engineering Technology Research Center of Chinese Materia Medica Processing, College of Pharmacy, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan 430065, China. kangxu05@hbtcm.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Lanqing", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Engineering Technology Research Center of Chinese Materia Medica Processing, College of Pharmacy, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan 430065, China. kangxu05@hbtcm.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Haiying", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Innovation and Attracting Talents \"111\" base, Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, College of Bioengineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China. lilywang@cqu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8492-2058"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Engineering Technology Research Center of Chinese Materia Medica Processing, College of Pharmacy, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan 430065, China. kangxu05@hbtcm.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Kang", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8891-1797"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Innovation and Attracting Talents \"111\" base, Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, College of Bioengineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China. lilywang@cqu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chunli", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Funct", "NlmUniqueID": "101549033", "ISSNLinking": "2042-6496"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TWZ37241OT", "NameOfSubstance": "diosmetin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Nude"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34755740", "10.1039/d1fo02111g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
