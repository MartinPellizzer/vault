This profile includes total lipids (TL), triglycerides (TG), cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). A dose of 1.5 ml of aqueous suspension of each herb/100 g body weight (equivalent to 75 mg/100 g body weight) was orally administered daily to alloxan-diabetic rats for four weeks. The present study showed 2-fold increase (p<0.05) in the plasma glucose level of diabetic rats, which received alloxan as a single dose of 120 mg/kg body weight, relative to the mean value of control group. This elevated glucose level was restored to its normal level after treatment with any one of the three herbs. Furthermore, the levels of TL, TG, cholesterol, LDL and VLDL were significantly (p<0.05) increased in the plasma and the liver tissues of diabetic rats compared to the control group, whereas HDL level was significantly (p<0.05) decreased. The plasma levels of all above parameters were normalized after treatment of the diabetic rats with Kammun Quaramany. Treatment of diabetic rats with Tennis normalized TG, cholesterol, LDL and VLDL levels, but Halfa barr restored the induced levels of plasma cholesterol, LDL and HDL to their normal levels. On the other hand, treatment with any of the three herbal suspensions could not restore the concentrations of the all tested parameters in the liver. These data demonstrated that the glycemic control of any of the three herbal suspensions was associated with their hypocholesterolemic effects on the hypercholesterolemia of the alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Moreover, the Kammun Quaramany showed the most potent effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Alexandria University, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Newairy", "ForeName": "Al-Sayeda A", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mansour", "ForeName": "Hamdy A", "Initials": "HA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yousef", "ForeName": "M I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sheweita", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health B", "NlmUniqueID": "7607167", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lupinus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zygophyllum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12369764", "10.1081/PFC-120014877"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
