Patients with cancer frequently use medicinal plants, with a frequency ranging from 11% to 39%. No studies have evaluated these patients in the Beni Mellal-Khenifra region.", "We investigated the beneficial and adverse effects of medicinal plants used by patients with cancer in this region.", "We conducted a retrospective study of the outcomes of traditional treatment with medicinal plants (retrospective treatment-outcome study: RTO) in 194 patients with cancer at the regional oncology centre of B\u00e9ni Mellal.", "Beneficial effects were reported by 39% of patients. All users of the seeds of Prunus armeniaca L. reported beneficial effects (100%), followed by Curcuma longa L. (50%). We did not observe any significant difference in efficacies between the most commonly used plants (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Patients with cancer who had a low socioeconomic level experienced greater benefits from herbal medicines (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The prevalence of adverse effects was 16%. Juniperus oxycedrus L. was perceived as the most toxic plant (13 patients), as it induced significantly greater toxicity than the other plants (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Patients with a cancer duration of more than 12 months reported more adverse effects (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05).", "The frequency of beneficial effects was higher than that of adverse effects. Health professionals should be aware of these effects in the process of therapeutic education.
