This immunological activity warrants the further analysis of its ligand-binding properties with special attention paid to blood group epitopes. To avoid the microheterogeneity and complexity of naturally occurring glycoproteins, chemically strictly defined neoglycoconjugates and a panel of synthetic oligosaccharides were employed in solid-phase assays for direct binding and assessment of the relative inhibitory capacity. Since label incorporation into the lectin, although performed under protective conditions, or surface immobilization by adsorption to plastic may affect its affinity characteristics, the extent of neoglycoconjugate binding in the absence of any interfering substance and in the presence of oligosaccharides was determined comparatively with labeled and with immobilized lectin. In principle, these two factors could be excluded to markedly alter binding features. In addition to lactose, the blood group determinants H and B were strongly reactive. A fucose residue can thus especially be accommodated to the binding site when linked to the non-reducing unit. N-Acetyllactosamine was nearly as potent as an inhibitor as lactose. Lec and the A determinant were notably inferior to the other ABH blood group epitopes. Le(a) and Le(x) and their sialylated derivatives displayed only very weak binding capacity. Among the two natural isomers of sialyllactose, the alpha 2,6-form displayed a higher level of inhibitory capacity than the alpha 2,3-derivative. Isomeric variants of the Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen, too, reduced lectin binding to the lactose-carrying polymer. Their capacities were surpassed by those of the H and the B determinants and a related form of the latter, the P1 epitope. An overlap of specificity with the immunomodulatory human galectin-3 is thus measurable for H/B-like structures. The documented differential reactivity of the mistletoe lectin to blood group oligosaccharides may have a bearing on the responsiveness of blood group-positive cell populations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shemyakin Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russian Federation."}], "LastName": "Galanina", "ForeName": "O E", "Initials": "OE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kaltner", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khraltsova", "ForeName": "L S", "Initials": "LS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bovin", "ForeName": "N V", "Initials": "NV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gabius", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Mol Recognit", "NlmUniqueID": "9004580", "ISSNLinking": "0952-3499"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Group Antigens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Galactosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoconjugates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toxins, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ribosome inactivating protein, Viscum"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding, Competitive"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotinylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Group Antigens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Galactosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoconjugates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Binding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Toxins, Biological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9408830", "10.1002/(SICI)1099-1352(199705/06)10:3<139::AID-JMR358>3.0.CO;2-R", "10.1002/(SICI)1099-1352(199705/06)10:3<139::AID-JMR358>3.0.CO;2-R"]}}]}
