C-Glycosides are usually characterized by the C-C bond that forms between the anomeric carbon of sugar moieties and the carbon atom of aglycon, which is usually resistant against acidic hydrolysis and enzymatic treatments. Interestingly, C-glycosides could be cleaved by several intestinal bacteria, but whether the enzymatic cleavage of C-C glycosidic bond is reduction or hydrolysis has been controversial; furthermore, whether existence of a \"C-glycosidase\" directly catalyzing the cleavage is not clear. Here we review research advances about the discovery and mechanism of intestinal bacteria in enzymatic cleavage of C-C glycosidic bond with an emphasis on the identification of enzymes manipulation the deglycosylation. Finally, we give a brief conclusion about the mechanism of C-glycoside deglycosylation and perspectives for future study in this field."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
