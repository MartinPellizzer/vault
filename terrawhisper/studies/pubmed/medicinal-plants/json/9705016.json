The extracts were administered i.p. and topically, respectively. The best antiinflammatory activity in the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema test, was shown by DE (31% inhibition), which did not show any irritant effect in the peritoneal examination 4 h after administration of the extracts. Furthermore, the highest activity in the croton oil-induced mouse ear edema test was also exhibited by DE (93% inhibition). Since DE was the most effective of the extracts in both tests, it's activity was assessed in various inflammation models in rats. At 100 mg/kg, DE markedly inhibited inflammation produced by dextran (66.6% inhibition) and decreased weakly the edema induced by zymosan A, carrageenan and C16-platelet activation factor (C16-PAF) (33.2, 31.6 and 23.8%, respectively). At 50 mg/kg, DE only significantly reduced the swelling caused by dextran (36.2%). No effect was observed at the same doses in arachidonic acid-induced edema. A clear dose-related antiinflammatory activity of DE was seen in the croton oil-induced mouse ear edema test, and ED50 calculated was found to be 25.5 microg/ear. which was much lower than ED50 obtained for indomethacin (56.1 microg/ear)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unitat de Farmacologia i Farmacogn\u00f2sia, Facultat de Farm\u00e0cia, Universitat de Barcelona, Spain."}], "LastName": "Segura", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vila", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Esp\u00f3sito-Avella", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Adzet", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ca\u00f1igueral", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9705016", "10.1016/s0378-8741(98)00047-6", "S0378874198000476"]}}]}
