Research on natural active components with anti-adipogenesis effects in plants has aroused the interest of researchers. One of the most critical problems is establishing sample preparation and analytical techniques for quickly and selectively extracting and determining the active anti-adipogenesis components in complex plant matrices for developing new anti-adipogenic drugs. In this study, a new poly(deep eutectic solvents) surface imprinted graphene oxide composite (PDESs-MIP/GO) with high selectivity for phenolic acids was prepared using deep eutectic solvents as monomers and crosslinkers. A miniaturized centrifugation-accelerated pipette-tip matrix solid-phase dispersion method (CPT-MSPD) with PDESs-MIP/GO as adsorbent, coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography, was further developed for the rapid determination of anti-adipogenesis markers in Solidago decurrens Lour. (SDL). The established method was successfully used to determination anti-adipogenesis markers in SDL from different regions, with the advantages of accuracy (recoveries: 94.4\u00a0-\u00a0115.9\u00a0%, RSDs\u00a0\u2264\u00a09.8\u00a0%), speed (CPT-MSPD time: 11\u00a0min), selectivity (imprinting factor: \u223c2.0), and economy (2\u00a0mg of adsorbent and 1\u00a0mL of solvents), which is in line with the current advanced principle of \"3S+2A\" in analytical chemistry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
