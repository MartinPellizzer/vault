While Panax notoginseng has been used as an anti-cancer medicinal herb in recent years, how it achieves this therapeutic effect has not been thoroughly elucidated. The purpose of this study was to reveal more about the mechanism of the cytotoxic effect of Panax notoginseng on prostate cancer (PCa) cells.", "Ethanol extract of Panax notoginseng root was authenticated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The cytotoxic activity of this herb against PCa cells was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method, flow cytometry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).", "The assessment of cellular metabolic activity demonstrated that Panax notoginseng reduces the viability of LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Annexin-V binding flow cytometry assay showed that Panax notoginseng induces apoptosis in PCa cells. Cell cycle analysis by quantification of DNA content using flow cytometry showed that Panax notoginseng arrests the cell cycle at the G2/M phase in both LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Moreover, ELISA demonstrated that Panax notoginseng-treated PCa cells secrete significantly less tumor-promoting cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) to the supernatant compared with controls.", "These results provide evidence for the cytotoxic effects of Panax notoginseng on PCa cell lines. This botanical is a promising candidate for the complementary and integrative medicine treatment of PCa and further studies are indicated to determine the anti-cancer mechanism of Panax notoginseng."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
