Hepatotoxic rats were treated with MEC for a period of 90 days (60mg/kg body weight, daily, orally by intubation). Anti-hepatotoxic effect was studied by assaying the activities of serum marker enzymes like aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, lactate dehydrogenase etc. and glucose (6) phosphate dehydrogenase in liver. We also estimated the concentrations of total proteins, total lipids, triglycerides, phospholipids and cholesterol in serum, liver and kidney. The activities of all the marker enzymes registered a significant elevation in carbon tetrachloride-treated rats, which were significantly recovered towards an almost normal level in animals co-administered with MEC. Other biochemical changes induced by carbon tetrachloride too showed reliable signs of retrieving towards the normalcy. Histopathological analysis confirmed the biochemical investigations. This study unravels the anti-hepatotoxic activity of MEC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam, India. venukumarmr2000@yahoo.co.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Venukumar", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Latha", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CL2T97X0V0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15573529"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
