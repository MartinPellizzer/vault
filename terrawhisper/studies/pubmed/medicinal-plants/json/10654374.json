His urological problems were not diseases arising from full health but a new variation in a life accompanied by illnesses. Some sources date the first colics he experienced to the year 1795 and others say 1805. The most dramatic period in the course of his illness was in February, when he suffered from fever of such an extent that one could speak of urosepsis. Recovery took place slowly and was accompanied by minor relapses. Nothing about this is written down in his work. On the advice of his doctors, Goethe undertook a cure in Lauchst\u00e4dt in July and August. The report of his consultant, Professor Johann Christian Reil, on his problems in the field of urology remained undiscovered until 1937. Professor Reil recommended treatment with thermae carolinae, aqua calcis, soap soda crystallisata, herbae subastringentes, and uva ursi, among other measures. With increasing age, Goethe's colics disappeared. The passing of a stone has never been described. Whereas Goethe hinted about medical problem other than those reported herein, the urological problems discussed in this article were left unmentioned. Nonetheless, literature that deals with Goethe's diseases is interesting from the aspect of both the history of medicine and the history of culture."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Georg-August-Universit\u00e4t, Klinik und Poliklinik f\u00fcr Urologie, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany. agross@gwdg.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gross", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hummel", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Biography", "Historical Article", "Journal Article", "Portrait"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "World J Urol", "NlmUniqueID": "8307716", "ISSNLinking": "0724-4983"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["etiology", "history", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteremia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Famous Persons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 18th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "history", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Urinary Calculi"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "history", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Urinary Tract Infections"}], "PersonalNameSubjectList": [{"LastName": "Goethe"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10654374", "10.1007/s003450050169"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
