Drugs were injected ip into 47-day-old SD rats once a day. At 50 days of age, all rats in the model group and drug groups also received a single ip injection of 60 mg/kg MNU. Rats in group 1 received ip injection of physiological saline. All rats were killed at different times after MNU or physiological saline treatment. The apoptotic index of photoreceptor cells was calculated by TUNEL labeling; retinal damage was evaluated based on retinal thickness and the expression of NF-kappaB family members was detected by Western blot.", "TMP injections, in a dose-dependent manner, suppressed photoreceptor cell apoptosis and decreased its loss in the peripheral retina. As compared with the MNU-treated group, TMP injection at a dose of 160 mg/kg also time-dependently upregulated the NF-kappaB/p65 protein level in the nucleus and downregulated the IkappaBalpha protein level in the cytoplasm. However, no protective effect of TMP injection on MNU-induced central retinal damage was found.", "TMP injection partially protects against MNU-induced retinal damage by upregulating the nuclear translocation of p65 to inhibit photoreceptor cells apoptosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Xinxiang Medical College, Xinxiang 453003, China. jinnan1@126.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jin-Nan", "Initials": "JN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jin-Mao", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Shao-Chun", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Dai", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Shi-Xing", "Initials": "SX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "I-kappa B Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nfkbia protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factor RelA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "139874-52-5", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "684-93-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylnitrosourea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V80F4IA5XG", "NameOfSubstance": "tetramethylpyrazine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "I-kappa B Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ligusticum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methylnitrosourea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrazines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Retinal Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factor RelA"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15960898", "10.1111/j.1745-7254.2005.00141.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
