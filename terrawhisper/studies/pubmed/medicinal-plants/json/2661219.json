In all cereals (except ragi) and in all pulses (except black gram) linoleic acid (18:2 n-6) was the major fatty acid. On an average pulses contained more alpha-linolenic acid (18:3 n-3) than cereals. From data on dietary intakes of the rural population in India, the average per caput consumption of total invisible fat, 18:2 n-6 and 18:3 n-3 from cereals, pulses and milk was calculated. From the figures arrived at for 18:2 n-6 in cereals, pulses and milk and the FAO/WHO 1977 recommendations for 18:2 n-6 (3 per cent of energy), the vegetable oil requirement for different physiological groups has been computed. These calculations showed that the ratio of 18:2 n-6/18:3 n-3 with sources of oils other than rapseed was higher than the desirable ratio of 10. The current view of upper limits of energy from total fat is 30 per cent. Diets of high income groups provide 12 per cent of energy from invisible fat. To keep the calories from total fat below 30 per cent, visible fat intake in Indian diets should not exceed 18 per cent or 50 g/person/d."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Nutrition, Indian Council of Medical Research, Hyderabad."}], "LastName": "Ghafoorunissa"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Clin Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8804070", "ISSNLinking": "0954-3007"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fats"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Coronary Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fats"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Intake"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "31"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2661219"]}}]}
