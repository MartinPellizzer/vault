Activation of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels is the major cause of their cardiotoxicity, however, influence on K<sup>+</sup> channels may also play a role in the overall effect.Here we report the synthesis of a series of lipo-alkaloids, including four new compounds, based on the 14-benzoylaconine structure, which is the core of a vast number of diterpene alkaloids naturally occurring in <i>Aconitum</i> species. The activities of these compounds were measured <i>in vitro</i> on K<sup>+</sup> ion channels using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Structure-activity analysis was carried out based on the data of 51\u00a0compounds (32 genuine diterpene alkaloids, 5 fatty acids, and 14 lipo-alkaloids). Depending on their substitution, these compounds exert different activities on GIRK (G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channel) and hERG (human ether-\u00e0-go-go-related gene) channels. Fatty acids and diterpene alkaloids show lower activity on the GIRK channel than lipo-alkaloids. Lipo-alkaloids also have less pronounced hERG inhibitory activity compared to the cardiotoxic aconitine. Considering the GIRK/hERG selectivity as an indicator of perspective therapeutic applicability, lipo-alkaloids are significantly more selective than the genuine diterpene alkaloids. 14-Benzoyl-8-<i>O</i>-eicosa-8<i>Z</i>,11<i>Z</i>,14<i>Z</i>-trienoate and 14-benzoyl-8-<i>O</i>-eicosa-11<i>Z</i>,14<i>Z</i>,17<i>Z</i>-trienoate are strong and selective inhibitors of GIRK channels, thus, they are promising subjects for further studies to develop diterpene alkaloid-based antiarrhythmic pharmacons."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Centre for Natural Products, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary."}], "LastName": "Kiss", "ForeName": "Tivadar", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary."}], "LastName": "Borcsa", "ForeName": "Botond", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Rytmion Ltd., Szeged, Hungary."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary."}], "LastName": "Orvos", "ForeName": "P\u00e9ter", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Rytmion Ltd., Szeged, Hungary."}], "LastName": "T\u00e1losi", "ForeName": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Centre for Natural Products, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary."}], "LastName": "Hohmann", "ForeName": "Judit", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Centre for Natural Products, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary."}], "LastName": "Csupor", "ForeName": "Dezs\u0151", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Channels"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aconitum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HEK293 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patch-Clamp Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Channels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}], "CoiStatement": "Conflict of Interest: The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28472842", "10.1055/s-0043-109556"]}}]}
