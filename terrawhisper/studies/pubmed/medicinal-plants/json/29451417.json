In this study, we demonstrated that high levels of coumestrol (COU) were associated with purple symptoms of CLB and that COU has strong antioxidant activity. Additionally, we found that COU is restricted to the pigmented areas of purple leaves, and the pigmentation is restricted to the adaxial surfaces, suggesting that COU may be acting as a sunscreen. Even though COU is associated with the purple leaf symptom, this coumestan is not the direct cause of discoloration in that COU is colorless. Quantification of chlorophyll a and b and total carotenoids suggested that blighted but not purple or asymptomatic leaves were undergoing photooxidative stress. Because the purple symptom is associated with high COU concentrations, lower biomass of C. cf. flagellaris, and lower cercosporin concentrations, we conclude that the purple symptom is a disease resistance reaction, mediated in part by COU, which provides a high level of antioxidant activity and, hence, partial resistance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4609-210X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First, second, fourth, and seventh authors, Department of Plant Pathology and Crop Physiology, Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Baton Rouge 70803;
