Microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) plays a crucial role in autophagy. It has multiple pairs of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with other proteins, and these PPIs have an effect on the regulation of autophagosome formation and the recruitment of autophagic substrates. In our previous work, a small molecule covalent inhibitor <b>DC-LC3in-D5</b> which could inhibit LC3A/B PPIs was identified, but a detailed study of structure-activity relationships (SARs) was lacking. Herein, a new molecule <b>LC3in-C42</b> was discovered utilizing the hybridization of advantageous fragments, whose potency (IC<sub>50</sub> = 7.6 nM) had been greatly improved compared with that of <b>DC-LC3in-D5</b>. <b>LC3in-C42</b> inhibits autophagy at the cellular level and its efficacy far exceeds that of <b>DC-LC3in-D5</b>. Thus far, <b>LC3in-C42</b> stands as the most potent LC3A/B small molecule inhibitor. <b>LC3in-C42</b> could serve as a powerful tool for LC3A/B protein and autophagy research."]}, "AuthorList":
