Chitt. (<i>EASA</i>) is a commonly used medicinal plant for the treatment of fractures, osteoarthritis, back pain, and wound healing in Southern Africa. In this study, the effects of water and acetone extracts of <i>EASA</i> on the viability, osteogenic differentiation, and mineralization of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) were investigated <i>in vitro</i>. The results showed that both water and acetone extracts of <i>EASA</i> increased cell viability at concentrations between 10 and 50\u2009\u03bcg/mL on day 7 and 14 of treatment. Osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of hADSCs were optimal at 5\u2009\u03bcg/mL for the water extract and at 5-10\u2009\u03bcg/mL for the acetone extract. A 5\u2009\u03bcg/mL acetone extract upregulated the expression of the <i>ALP, Runx2, Col1a1</i>, and osteopontin genes. In addition, <i>EASA</i> upregulated <i>\u03b2-catenin, cyclin D1</i>, and osteoprotegerin (<i>OPG</i>). The results suggest that <i>EASA</i> may likely upregulate the expression of <i>\u03b2-catenin</i>, which subsequently upregulates the osteogenic marker genes through <i>Runx2</i>. However, <i>EASA</i> also upregulates <i>cyclin D1</i> supporting the growth of precursor cells. Additionally, <i>EASA</i> upregulated the expression of <i>OPG</i> suggesting that it may inhibit bone resorption. The results of this study support the traditional use of the plant in bone healing. Impact statement Herbal remedies are used to treat various ailments by almost 80% of the developing world. <i>Eucomis autumnalis</i> is one of the most used medicinal plants in Southern Africa for the treatment of backache, osteoarthritis, and healing of fracture. There is a scarcity of scientific evidence to prove the efficacy of <i>E. autumnalis</i> for fracture repair. This study sought to assess the effect of the crude extracts <i>in vitro</i> and found that <i>E. autumnalis</i> promoted viability and osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells as demonstrated by biochemical and genetic markers. This medicinal plant could therefore have potential to regenerate bone tissue."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Science, Tshwane University of Technology, Pretoria, South Africa."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Applied and Computer Sciences, Vaal University of Technology, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Mkhumbeni", "ForeName": "Nolutho", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Applied and Computer Sciences, Vaal University of Technology, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Pillay", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Applied and Computer Sciences, Vaal University of Technology, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Mtunzi", "ForeName": "Fanyana", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Technology Transfer and Innovation, Durban University of Technology, Durban, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Motaung", "ForeName": "Keolebogile Shirley Caroline", "Initials": "KSC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Tissue Eng Part A", "NlmUniqueID": "101466659", "ISSNLinking": "1937-3341"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adipocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adipose Tissue"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osteogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stem Cells"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34269614", "10.1089/ten.TEA.2021.0115"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
