Phytochemical screening and <i>in vitro</i> antioxidant activities was carried out using standard methods. Hepatoprotective efficacy of extracts were carried out in <i>Swiss albino</i> mice using paracetamol induced hepatotoxicity. Animals were administered with <i>swaras</i> and <i>hima</i> extracts of both plants at 200 mg/kg BW dose for 7 days and on 8<sup>th</sup> day hepatotoxicity was induced by intraperitoneal injection of paracetamol at 500 mg/kg BW. The degree of liver protection was determined by measuring the levels of liver enzymes followed by histopathology.", "The results of phytochemical, antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities showed that there were no significant difference between <i>swaras</i> and <i>hima</i> extracts. Both the extract of <i>T. cordifolia</i> were equally potent in reducing SGOT (<i>P</i> < 0.01) and ALP level (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Similar effects were observed with the <i>Swaras</i> and <i>hima</i> extracts of <i>B. diffusa</i>. Both the extracts reduced SGOT and ALP (<i>P</i> < 0.01).
