The inhibitory ratio of nitrosamine synthesis and the scavenging ratio of nitrite of the 11 herbal medicines, Vit C and rutin were determined in intro compare with Vit C and the standard ample of rutin. The results indicate that each sample exhibits certain ability to inhibitiory nitrosamine synthesis. Among these samples, Honeysuckle flower is found to be of best effects, its inhibitory ratio and scavenging ratio reaches 78.5% and 60.5%, respectively. Except kudzuvine root, the other samples with higher content of flavonoid result in a higher inhibitory or scavenging ratio, and the relative coefficient reaches a value of 0.9338 and 0.9272, respectively, displaying notable positive correlation. The concentrations of IC50 (g x L(-1)) of flavonoid extracted from honeysuckle, rutin and VC were 0.013, 0.022 and 0.187, respectively. While the inhibitory ratio of synthesis of nitrosamines reached 50%, and those were 0.042, 0.024 and 0.041, respectively. While scavenging ratio of nitrite reaches 50%. The inhibitory ratio of synthesis of nitrosamine of flavonoids extracted from honeysuckle flower is higher than that of Vit C and rutin, and the scavenging ratio of nitrite is similar to that of Vit C."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Biotechnology, Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou 310035, China. wangqi1956@126.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Diying", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ronghua", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrosamines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrosamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20931851", "10.4268/cjcmm20101515"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
