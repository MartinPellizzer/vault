Plant-derived medicines may open new ways in the field of antiplasmodial therapy. This study is aimed to investigate the toxicity and in vivo antiplasmodial activity of apigenin, a dietary flavonoid. Apigenin cytotoxicity was investigated on Huh7 cell line, brine shrimp (Artemia salina) larva, and human red blood cells. In vivo toxicity of apigenin was assessed by metabolomics approaches. Apigenin exhibited significant suppression of parasitemia in a dose-dependent manner; it suppressed Plasmodium berghei growth by 69.74%, 50.3%, and 49.23% at concentrations of 70, 35, and 15\u00a0mg/kg/day, respectively. The IC<sub>50</sub> value for apigenin after 24\u00a0hr exposure to Huh7 cells was 225\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Apigenin did not show noticeable toxicity on A.\u00a0salina and also on the membrane integrity of red blood cells. After 24\u00a0hr exposure of mice to apigenin, alterations were seen in the metabolism of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, bile acid metabolism (alternative pathway), sulfur metabolism, bile acid metabolism, metabolism of estrogens and androgens, cholesterol catabolism, and biosynthesis of cholesterol. These findings indicate that apigenin has potential in vivo antiplasmodial activity against P.\u00a0berghei infected mice with high selectivity against malaria, but it can disrupt some metabolic pathways in mice."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Parasitology and Mycology, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amiri", "ForeName": "Mahdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Parasitology and Mycology, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nourian", "ForeName": "Abbasali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Group, Faculty of Basic Sciences, University of Mohaghegh Ardabili, Ardabil, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khoshkam", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0369-2981"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Gene Therapy Research Center, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ramazani", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "A-12-153-11", "Agency": "Zanjan University of Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimalarials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7V515PI7F6", "NameOfSubstance": "Apigenin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimalarials"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Apigenin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Artemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Malaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Networks and Pathways"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plasmodium berghei"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29748995", "10.1002/ptr.6113"]}}]}
