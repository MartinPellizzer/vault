The use of roots and leaves to this day remains the acceptable family planning device among the minorities of Bukidnon. The \"kilala\" and the \"huwag\"--a variety of the \"rattan\" tree--are the most popular plants used by the minorities. The experiences of villagers with these traditional methods are recounted. Folk methods of family planning are not limited to roots and leaves only. Another method used by minorities is incantation. The traditional methods continue to rate high due in part to the fact that sex continues to be a taboo conversation topic. The users of modern contraceptive methods are mostly those couples who live along the highways, for they are more exposed to innovations such as birth control devices. To the minorities in the hinterlands, modern contraceptive methods continue to be foreign objects."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["009481", "00110804"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: POPULATION FORUM"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Asia", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Demographic Factors", "Developing Countries", "Family Planning", "Health", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Philippines", "Plants, Medicinal", "Population", "Population Characteristics", "Rural Population", "Southeastern Asia"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12338242", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1982", "Month": "10", "Day": "05"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"JournalIssue": {"Volume": "7", "Issue": "4", "PubDate": {"Year": "1981"}}, "Title": "Population forum : monthly newsletter of the Commission on Population", "ISOAbbreviation": "Popul Forum"}, "ArticleTitle": "The minorities of Bukidnon.
