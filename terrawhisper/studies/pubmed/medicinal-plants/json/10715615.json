The activity of the NOX correlates with rate of cell enlargement, which helps to determine how rapidly cells will divide. When NOX activity is inhibited, cells fail to enlarge following division and the result is a population of small cells unable to reach the minimum size required for them to divide again. In plants, cells fail to enlarge when NOX activity is inhibited. When NOX activity is stimulated or constitutively activated, as in cancer, cells enlarge more rapidly and the rate of cell division also is enhanced. Both cell growth and NOX activity are sometimes stimulated by low concentrations of normally inhibitory molecules. These properties define chemical hormesis, making the NOX molecule a molecular target to explain hormetic growth responses and to utilize hormetic principles to increase, for example, crop yields with plants. The NOX activity at the cell surface oscillates with a temperature-compensated 24-min ultradian (<24 h) periodicity. The indicated function of the NOX protein as a time-keeping mechanism adds to its potential importance as a molecular target for chemical hormesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907-1333, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morr\u00e9", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8109495", "ISSNLinking": "0260-437X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Multienzyme Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xenobiotics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.-", "NameOfSubstance": "NADH oxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.-", "NameOfSubstance": "NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Multienzyme Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Development"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Xenobiotics"}], "NumberOfReferences": "42"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10715615", "10.1002/(SICI)1099-1263(200003/04)20:2<157::AID-JAT648>3.0.CO;2-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
