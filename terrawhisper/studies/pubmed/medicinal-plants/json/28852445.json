The aim of the present study was to assess burn wound healing activity of <i>C. moschata</i> peel extract (CE). Also, standardized CE was assessed for antioxidant activity and antibacterial effects against major pathogens of burns.", "Healing properties of topical preparation of 10% and 20% concentrations of CE were assessed on second degree burn in rats during a 14-day period as well as histological studies, total antioxidant power, lipid peroxidation and total thiol content of skin tissue samples.", "Radical scavenging IC<sub>50</sub> and ferric-reducing antioxidant power value were 4.015\u00b10.20 mg/ml and 142.63\u00b12.65 mmol Fe<sup>2+</sup>/g, respectively. Total mucilage content was 13.8%. The optimal results were obtained by 20% CE that showed 90.80\u00b15.86 % wound closure and tissue repair as well as significant reduction of tissue oxidative stress biomarkers. Histological analyses confirmed wound healing activity of pumpkin peel extract.", "Considering the high mucilage content of the plant, providing a moist environment for wound, <i>C. moschata</i> peel extract could be a natural remedy for treatment of burns.
