All doses of extract were dissolved in normal saline and administered intraperitoneally 30 minutes before formalin injection to the mouse paw. Nociception was recorded 0-5 (early phase, A) and 15-40 (late phase, B) minutes after formalin injection. The alkaloid extract was subjected to silica gel column chromatography using a linear gradient with a CHCl3-MeOH system and different fractions collected. The effective fraction in formalin test were further purified and isolated by preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) and identified on the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.", "Alkaloid extract in doses (mg/kg) used induced significant reduction in pain response when compared to control as follow: 16 (28.63%), 20 (59.15%), 24 (80.75%), 28 (90.14%) and 30 (100%) in the early phase and 20 (24.67%), 24 (59.93%), 28 (78.52%) and 30 (100%) in late phase. Observed responses in both phases of A and B were dose-dependent with r2 of 0.93 and 0.99 respectively.
