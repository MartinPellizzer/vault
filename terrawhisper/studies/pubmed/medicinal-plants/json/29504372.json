Plants and spices produce various metabolites with antibacterial and antioxidant potential. These metabolites are principally revealed as encouraging healing components or mediators which control ailments in human beings. The present study was aimed to characterize the extracts from selected medicinal plants through in-vitro activities. Winged prickly ash, green tea and thyme were selected and extracted through ethanol and methanol solutions. The extracts were assessed for antibacterial and antioxidant activities. The antibacterial potential of extracts showed the significant extent of the activity against Bacillus subtilis and E. coli. The maximum activity was noted in 80% methanolic fraction of Thymus vulgaris (15.20\u00b10.64 mm) against Bacillus subtilis. Antioxidant potential exhibited the highest phenolic and flavonoid content in Camellia sinensis . The total phenolic content was significantly higher (1456.26\u00b112.05 mg gallic acid) in 80% ethanolic fraction of Camellia sinensis. The flavonoid content in different plant extracts ranged from 8.17\u00b12.02 to 376.29\u00b17.11 mg/g. The radical scavenging DPPH assay also showed the significant antioxidant capacity of selected plants with the methanolic (50%) extract of Camellia sinensis found to be the most potent (78.95\u00b17.12%). It was concluded that the alcoholic extracts of selected medicinal plants revealed the effective antibacterial and antioxidant activity, showing protective prospective against oxidative injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hafiz", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Bhatti", "ForeName": "H N", "Initials": "HN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hanif", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shahid", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Regul Homeost Agents", "NlmUniqueID": "8809253", "ISSNLinking": "0393-974X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Camellia sinensis"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Thymus Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zanthoxylum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29504372", "15"]}}]}
