The incidence of psoriasis is increasing in recent decades. Some patients with psoriasis are anxious about the underlying side effects of synthetic drugs they are on. Therefore, they are eager to seek alternative and efficient therapy, such as Chinese herbal medicine (CHM). Researchers have found some CHM provides best source for the development of anti-psoriatic drugs because of their structural diversity and fewer adverse reactions. Some of CHM formulas or active constituents extracted from CHM have been rapidly developed into clinical drugs with good efficacy. At present, along with the CHM formulas, single CHM and its active components have been extensively accepted and utilized in the treatment of psoriasis, whose therapeutic mechanisms hitherto have not been thoroughly illustrated.", "This review aimed to comprehensively summarize about the existing therapeutic mechanisms of CHM in the treatment of psoriasis and to provide a reference to develop future related studies in this field.", "Relevant literatures about how CHM treated psoriasis were acquired from published scientific studies (including PubMed, CNKI, Web of Science, Baidu Scholar, The Plant List, Elsevier and SciFinder). All plants appearing in the review have been included in The Plant List or Medicinal Plant Names Services (MPNS).", "In this review, we collect numerous literatures about how CHM treats psoriasis via immune cells, signaling pathways and disease-related mediators and systematically elucidates potential mechanisms from the point of the suppression of oxidative stress, the inhibition of abnormal abnormal proliferation and differentiation, the inhibition of immune responses, and the suppression of angiogenesis.", "Psoriasis is considered as a complicated disease caused by interaction among various mechanisms. The CHM formulas, single CHM and its active components have considerable positive reports about the treatment of psoriasis, which brings hope for a promising future of CHM in the clinical therapy of psoriasis. In the paper, we have concluded that the existing therapeutic mechanisms of CHM in the treatment of psoriasis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
