The following samples were tested: fresh, frozen, dried in a food dryer, dried in the sun, and lyophilized. The samples were incubated in gastric juice (pepsin, NaCl, HCl) and in intestinal juice (NaHCO<sub>3</sub> , pancreatin, bile salts) with the aim of verifying the bioaccessibility of the bioelements and the digestibility of mushrooms. Four bioelements that are essential for the human body were studied: Mg, Zn, Cu, and Fe.", "It was found that Mg was extracted in the highest amounts from the sun-dried A. bisporus (1.620\u2009g\u2009kg<sup>-1</sup> d.w.). In the case of microelements, the lyophilized fruiting bodies of I. badia released Zn in the highest quantities (0.180\u2009g\u2009kg<sup>-1</sup> d.w.). Lyophilization and sun-drying methods were more advantageous than other methods. Fresh material was a more valuable source of bioelements than frozen material.", "Our results showed that edible mushrooms have a high content of bioelements that are easily bioaccessible, which indicates their health-promoting properties. \u00a9 2020 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8354-211X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krak\u00f3w, Poland."}], "LastName": "Ka\u0142a", "ForeName": "Katarzyna", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krak\u00f3w, Poland."}], "LastName": "Krakowska", "ForeName": "Agata", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Vegetable and Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Biotechnology and Horticulture, University of Agriculture in Krak\u00f3w, Krak\u00f3w, Poland."}], "LastName": "Zi\u0119ba", "ForeName": "Piotr", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krak\u00f3w, Poland."}], "LastName": "Opoka", "ForeName": "W\u0142odzimierz", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krak\u00f3w, Poland."}], "LastName": "Muszy\u0144ska", "ForeName": "Bo\u017cena", "Initials": "B"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2017/25/N/NZ7/00554", "Agency": "Narodowe Centrum Nauki", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Agaricus bisporus", "Cantharellus cibarius", "Xerocomus badius"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Agaricales"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Agaricus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Basidiomycota"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Juice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Boland M, Human digestion - a processing perspective.
