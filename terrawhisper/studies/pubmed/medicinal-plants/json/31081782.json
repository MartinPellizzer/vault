Based on the folk medicine literature, we explored the anticonvulsant and antiepileptogenic activity of aqueous ethanolic extracts of Fumaria indica, Euphorbia lactea, Euphorbia helioscopia, Neurada procumbens, and Euphorbia nivulia. The acute anticonvulsant activity of the extracts was determined at different concentrations in different groups of Swiss albino mice. Among all the materials tested, the ethanolic extracts of Euphorbia nivulia (eth-EN) alone was found to exhibit concentration-dependent anticonvulsant effects when evaluated against the acute convulsant dose of Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 90mg/kg, s.c.). eth-EN extract at 100mg/kg i.p concentration showed maximum protection against the PTZ induced mortality (P<0.05). eth-EN (100mg/kg) treated animals also showed significant reduction in the progression of epileptogenesis (P<0.05) when tested against the PTZ-induced (50mg/kg s.c.) chemical kindling model of epilepsy. The FT-IR spectra of this extract showed both known and unknown spectral peaks from which the presence of the functional groups; i.e. aromatics, diketones, alkenes, carbonyls, carboxylic acids and amide compounds were confirmed. The unknown peaks strongly suggested the presence of novel compounds that may be responsible for its anticonvulsant and antiepileptogenic activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy and Alternative Medicine, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rehman", "ForeName": "Agha Habibur", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy and Alternative Medicine, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan / Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia / Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, US."}], "LastName": "Al Sharari", "ForeName": "Shakir D", "Initials": "SD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy and Alternative Medicine, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Mahmood", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy and Alternative Medicine, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akhtar", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy and Alternative Medicine, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Younus", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy and Alternative Medicine, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ashraf", "ForeName": "Muhammad Nadeem", "Initials": "MN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticonvulsants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WM5Z385K7T", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentylenetetrazole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticonvulsants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Epilepsy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Euphorbia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fumaria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Kindling, Neurologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pentylenetetrazole"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Seizures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31081782"]}}]}
