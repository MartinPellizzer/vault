The non-imprinted poly(dimethyl vinylphosphonate) nanopowder (NIPDMVPN) was also synthesized utilizing the same procedure without using SnCl<sub>2</sub>\u00b72H<sub>2</sub>O in order to compare the results with the Sn(II)-IPDMVPN. The structure, morphology and composition of the products were characterized by XRD, SEM, EDX, XRF, BET, FT-IR and NMR techniques. Some experimental conditions including pH, eluent concentration and sample volume were optimized to maximize Sn(II) adsorption by the Sn(II)-IPDMVPN. It was found that the optimum conditions are pH\u202f=\u202f5, 1.00\u202fM of HNO<sub>3</sub> as eluent and sample volume up to 50\u202fmL. The results obtained by ICP-MS indicated that the Sn(II)-IPDMVPN had much higher adsorption capacity for Sn(II) ions (about threefold) than the NIPDMVPN. The applicability of the Sn(II)-IPDMVPN was also investigated in three different real samples. Under the best experimental conditions, the calibration graphs were linear in the range of 0.19-90\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> with a coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.990. The detection limit was calculated to be 0.06\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup>. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for six replicate measurements of Sn(II) at 1.00\u202fng\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup> was determined to be 1.8%. The results showed that the Sn(II)-IPDMVPN-ICP-MS is a very simple, rapid, sensitive and efficient method for the determination of Sn(II) ions in water samples."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
