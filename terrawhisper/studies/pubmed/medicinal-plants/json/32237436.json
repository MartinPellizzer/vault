It is edible and has been used as a natural medicine for thousands of years. At present, Noni has been legally introduced into China, but there is no clear standard of traditional Chinese medicine properties and clinical application of traditional Chinese medicine, which greatly limits the application of compatibility with traditional Chinese medicine in China. This article appllied our pioneering modern research technology of new herbal medicine outside of China, theoretically studied the traditional Chinese medicine properties of Noni, and scientifically guided the reasonable compatibility and application of Noni with traditional Chinese medicine. The Web of Science and PubMed databases were selected to access the literatures on Noni. The retrieval time was August 1, 2018, with Noni or Morinda citrifolia as the search term. A total of 862 articles were retrieved. By reading the titles and abstracts of the articles, in addition to repetitive and irrelevant literature, 251 scientific research literatures with reasonable design and high credibility were selected, including 25 clinical trials, 94 pharmacological experiments, and 51 chemical composition literatures. Through analysis of scientific research literatures, led by clinical experiments, supported by pharmacological experiments, combined with the research progress of chemical components, the medicinal properties were studied under the guidance of traditional Chinese medicine theory. The Chinese medicine property of Noni is flat, with acid and sweet flavor.The channel tropisms of Noni included kidney, liver and spleen. The function of Noni included tonifying kindey and liver, strengthening tendon and bone, yiqi yangyin. The clinical application of Noni is used for liver and kidney deficiency, waist and knee weakness, weak muscles and bones; Qi and Yin deficiency, tiredness and thirst. Taken as fruit pulp or dry powder, the equivalent of dried product is 1-4 g. Noni is also distributed in Taiwan, Hainan in China. Hainan, Yunnan have been cultivated and introduced. Give Noni a clear Chinese medicine property, and lay a theoretical foundation for the compatibility of Noni with traditional Chinese medicine, which can enrich the Chinese medicine resources and promote the development of Chinese medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jin-Lian", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ye-Bin", "Initials": "YB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lin-Yuan", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chun", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jian-Jun", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Xue-Min", "Initials": "XM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Morinda"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32237436", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20191230.403"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
