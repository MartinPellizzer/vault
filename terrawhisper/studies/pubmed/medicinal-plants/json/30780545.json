In the spring of 2006, extensive chlorosis was observed on both crops on commercial farms. Economic losses were low. Symptoms included foliar necrosis and a watery decay of the stem at the soil level. Necrotic tissues became covered with a whitish mycelium that produced dark sclerotia. Eventually, affected plants wilted and died. Samples of diseased stem tissue were surface sterilized for 1 min in 1% NaOCl and plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with 100 mg/l of streptomycin sulfate. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary (1) was consistently recovered from diseased stem pieces. Sclerotia from infected O. vulgare plants measured 1.8 to 3.4 \u00d7 1.8 to 6.1 (average 2.5 to 3.6) mm. Sclerotia from these isolates measured 1.3 to 4.7 \u00d7 1.6 to 6.1 (average 2.7 to 3.4) mm on PDA. Sclerotia from infected T. officinale plants measured 1.8 to 3.4 \u00d7 1.8 to 6.1 (average 2.5 to 3.6) mm. Sclerotia from these isolates measured 1.7 to 5.2 \u00d7 2.0 to 5.7 (average 3.3 to 3.8) mm on PDA. Pathogenicity of three isolates obtained from O. vulgare and three isolates from T. officinale was confirmed on each host. Inoculum consisted of 1 cm<sup>2</sup> of mycelial plugs excised from a 10-day-old PDA culture of each isolate. Plants were inoculated by placing a mycelial plug on the soil surface around the base of each plant. Ten plants were inoculated per isolate and an equal number of noninoculated plants served as controls. Plants were incubated at 10 to 27\u00b0C (average 18\u00b0C) and watered as needed. Pathogenicity tests were repeated once. All inoculated plants developed chlorosis within 12 to 18 days, followed by the appearance of white mycelium and sclerotia, and eventually wilt. Control plants remained symptomless. S. sclerotiorum was reisolated from inoculated plants of both hosts. To our knowledge, this is the first report of white mold on O. vulgare in Italy as well as worldwide and the first report of white mold on T. officinale in Italy. S. sclerotiorum is a well known pathogen of T. officinale (2) and its use as a mycoherbicide has been proposed (3). References: (1) N. F. Buchwald. Page 75. Den. Kgl.
