They were 18.59% (P < 0.01) and 4.94% (P < 0.01) respectively. There were morphological changes including chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation and formed apoptotic bodies after exposed to hypoxia/hypoglycemia for 2, 4, 6, 12 hours. After 2 hours of hypoxia/hypoglycemia, neuronal [Ca2+]i and the release of LDH were significantly increased. They were 8.46 nmol/L (P < 0.01) and 16.59% (P < 0.01) respectively. The effects were enhanced with the extending time of hypoxia/hypoglycemia. Salidroside might have significantly decreased the percentage of neuronal apoptosis and necrosis, reduced neuronal [Ca2+]i and the release of LDH. The effects of salidroside were strengthened with the increasing of Salidroside dosage.", "Salidroside has effect of anti-neuronal apoptosis.
