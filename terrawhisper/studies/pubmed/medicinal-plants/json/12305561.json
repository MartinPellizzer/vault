The thin stalks were dried, powdered, and extracted with alcohol; the residue was used in the study and named betel leaf stalk extract (BLSE). It was macerated with gum acacia, suspended in distilled water, and diluted to 25 mg/ml. The drug was fed by oral intubation. Initially 20 rats were used in 2 groups, one receiving BLSE 50 mg/kg body weight for 10 days and the other vehicle only. Both were caged with males for 15 days. Only 2 of 10 rats receiving BLSE gave birth to litters while 9 of 10 controls delivered. Number of pups was also reduced. In another experiment using 60 female rats to 30 while BLSE at 50 mg/100 gm body weight was fed for 3 days during diestrus to 30 while 30 controls received vehicle only. Successful mating was confirmed by sperm in vaginal smears. 8 of 30 treated rats delivered 3.5 pups each while 29 of 30 controls delivered 7 pups per rat. In a third experiment 10 female rats were given BLSE 50mg/100 gm body weight, 10 vehicle only, and 10 neoclinesterol 150 mcg/100 gm body weight for 4 consecutive days. On Day 5 the animals were sacrificed and weights of uterus and ovaries recorded. Antiestrogenic properties were studied in oophorectomized rats given stilbestrol 150 mcg/100 gm body weight by injection, then fed 150 mcg/100 gm body weight of neoclinesterol or BLSE, 50 mg/100 gm, but the neoclinesterol. Vaginal smears were examined for cornification on Days 2, 3, and 4. Progestational activity was studied in 12 immature female rabbits injected with stilbestrol then treated with BLSE or leutocycline. Tests for estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity of BLSE were negative. A mild progestational activity was found in immature estrogen-primed rabbits but some follicle depressant type action was noted as several graffian follicles were seen in their regressive phase when ovaries were sectioned. Similar findings were obtained in rats treated after spaying. Results show BLSE has a definite antifertility activity. When fed in diestrus phase the estrus cycle was not altered nor was any estrogenic or antiestrogenic effect noted."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["701594", "00010924"], "GeneralNote": [], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Animals, Laboratory", "Clinical Research", "Contraception", "Contraception Research", "Contraceptive Effectiveness", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Estrogens", "Family Planning", "Health", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Plants, Medicinal--administraction and dosage", "Plants, Medicinal--side effects", "Progesterone", "Research Methodology", "Use-effectiveness"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12305561", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1980", "Month": "01", "Day": "03"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0022-4286", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "4", "Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1970"}}, "Title": "The Journal of research in Indian medicine", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Res Indian Med"}, "ArticleTitle": "Antifertility effect of betal leaf stalk (Tambul patrabrint): a preliminary experimental study.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "143", "EndPage": "151", "MedlinePgn": "143-51"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tewari", "ForeName": "P V", "Initials": "PV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chaturvedi", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dixit", "ForeName": "S N", "Initials": "SN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Res Indian Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0206036", "ISSNLinking": "0022-4286"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4G7DS2Q64Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Progesterone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Laboratory"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraception"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Estrogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Family Planning Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Progesterone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1970", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1970", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12305561"]}}]}
