Along with their nutritional values, in the health industry, different parts of the plants of the citrus genus have been used as supplements or remedies to prevent or control diseases. This review focused on reported meta-analyses and clinical trials on the health benefits of citrus plants as functional foods. Also, chemical compounds of various citrus species were reviewed. The following information sources were used for data collection: Google Scholar, the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. Various keywords, including \"citrus AND chemical compounds,\" \"citrus AND phytochemicals,\" \"citrus species,\" \"citrus AND meta-analysis,\" \"nutritional and therapeutical values of citrus spp.,\" \"clinical trials AND citrus,\" \"clinical trials AND Rutaceae,\" \"health benefits of citrus spp.,\" \"citrus edible or non-edible applications,\" and scientific names of the citrus plants were utilized to collect data for the review. The scientific name and common name of all twenty-eight citrus species, along with any of the above keywords, were also searched in the mentioned databases. Scientific papers and data sources were sought to review and discuss the citrus plant's nutritional and therapeutic importance. Several meta-analyses and clinical trials have reported beneficial effects of citrus spices on a variety of cancer risks, cardiovascular risk factors, neurologic disorders, urinary tract conditions, and gastrointestinal tract conditions. They have shown anxiolytic, antimicrobial, and pain-alleviating effects. Some of them can be helpful in managing obesity and cardiovascular risk factors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.
