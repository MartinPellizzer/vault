Significant advances have been made in attempts to replace existing antifungal schedules, especially with synthetic targets. The identification of other platforms for drug discovery is now entrenched in research programs across the globe. Plants offer significant benefits owing to their numerical superiority, exceedingly broad chemical basis and appealing sustainability characteristics. Furthermore, plants have a long and rich historical association with traditional approaches towards fungal diseases. These have in numerous instances served as markers in the bioassay-guided identification of the active constituents. Although the plant family Amaryllidaceae is conventionally associated with cancer and motor-neuron disease chemotherapies, around 30 of its species have been examined for antifungal activities with microgram per millilitre inhibitory activities detected in several instances. This review focuses on the nearly 40 constituents from the family, mainly isoquinoline alkaloids, which have been screened against around 50 fungal pathogens. Encouragingly, microgram per millilitre growth inhibitory activities were applicable for several of the compounds with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml seen to be the lowest."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Plant Growth and Development, School of Life Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal Pietermaritzburg, Private Bag X01, Scottsville, 3209, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "Jerald J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0515-1281"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Plant Growth and Development, School of Life Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal Pietermaritzburg, Private Bag X01, Scottsville, 3209, South Africa."}], "LastName": "van Staden", "ForeName": "Johannes", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amaryllidaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29484733", "10.1002/ptr.6049"]}}]}
