Due to its excellent medicinal and nutritional value, it has been developed into a variety of functional products. Sea buckthorn polysaccharides (SPs), one of the important and representative active components, have attracted the attention of researchers in the fields of health food and medicine because of their potential beneficial effects on human health. Recently, SPs have shown various biological activities in <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies, such as anti-obesity, immunomodulatory, anti-tumor, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-fatigue, and hepatoprotective activities. This review provides a comprehensive and systematic summary of the extraction and purification methods, structural characterization, biological activity, and market trends of SPs to provide a theoretical basis for their therapeutic potential and sanitarian functions. A future scope is needed to further explore the medicinal and nutritional value of SPs and incorporate them in functional food products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xinmei", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xianfeng", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Shufu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, School of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, 611137, China. liuyue2@cdutcm.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Meishan Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Meishan, 620010, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, School of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, 611137, China. liuyue2@cdutcm.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Meishan Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Meishan, 620010, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0000-5327-9082"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, School of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, 611137, China. liuyue2@cdutcm.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Meishan Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Meishan, 620010, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Funct", "NlmUniqueID": "101549033", "ISSNLinking": "2042-6496"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hippophae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Functional Food"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38606510", "10.1039/d3fo04140a"]}}]}
