It is known that elevated TMAO plasma levels correlate with an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Even though there is a general consensus about the existence of a causal relationship between TMAO and CVD, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. TMAO is an oxidation product of the hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO), mainly of isoform 3, and it is conceivable that humans also have an enzyme reversing this toxification by reducing TMAO to its precursor trimethylamine (TMA). All prokaryotic enzymes that use TMAO as a substrate have molybdenum-containing cofactors in common. Such molybdenum-containing enzymes also exist in mammals, with the so-called mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (mARC) representing the most recently discovered mammalian molybdenum enzyme. The enzyme has been found to exist in two isoforms, mARC1 and mARC2, both being capable of reducing a variety of N-oxygenated compounds, including nonphysiological N-oxides. To investigate whether the two isoforms of this enzyme are able to reduce and detoxify TMAO, we developed a suitable analytical method and tested TMAO reduction with a recombinant enzyme system. We found that one of the two recombinant human mARC proteins, namely, hmARC1, reduces TMAO to TMA. The N-reductive activity is relatively low and identified via the kinetic parameters with K<sub>m</sub> = (30.4 \u00b1 9.8) mM and V<sub>max</sub> = (100.5 \u00b1 12.2) nmol/(mg protein\u00b7min). Nevertheless, the ubiquitous tissue expression of hmARC1 allows a continuous reduction of TMAO whereas the counter-reaction, the production of TMAO through FMO3, can take place only in the liver where FMO3 is expressed. TMAO reduction in porcine liver subfractions showed the characteristic enrichment of N-reductive activity in the outer mitochondrial membrane. TMAO reduction was also found in human cell cultures. These findings indicate the role of hmARC1 in the metabolomic pathway of TMAO, which might contribute to the prevention of CVD. This also hints at a physiological function of the molybdenum enzyme, which remains mainly unknown to date."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry , Pharmaceutical Institute of the Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel , 24118 Kiel , Germany."}], "LastName": "Schneider", "ForeName": "Jennifer", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry , Pharmaceutical Institute of the Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel , 24118 Kiel , Germany."}], "LastName": "Girreser", "ForeName": "Ulrich", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry , Pharmaceutical Institute of the Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel , 24118 Kiel , Germany."}], "LastName": "Havemeyer", "ForeName": "Antje", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Research Centre for Cultivated Plants , Julius Kuehn Institute , 06484 Quedlinburg , Germany."}], "LastName": "Bittner", "ForeName": "Florian", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1412-6117"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry , Pharmaceutical Institute of the Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel , 24118 Kiel , Germany."}], "LastName": "Clement", "ForeName": "Bernd", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Chem Res Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8807448", "ISSNLinking": "0893-228X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitochondrial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component 1, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component 2, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FLD0K1SJ1A", "NameOfSubstance": "trimethyloxamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inactivation, Metabolic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methylamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondrial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29856598", "10.1021/acs.chemrestox.7b00329"]}}]}
