Other than increasing the safety and efficacy of these products, the public needs to be aware of the possible interactions that could occur when combined with conventional drug therapy. Despite the lack of sufficient information on the safety of herbal products, their use as an alternative and complementary medicine is globally widespread. Herbal medicines are now mainly used in active pharmaceutical ingredients. Concurrent usage of natural and prescription medicines is of significant concern. The most significant therapeutic consequence of this approach is the herbal-drug interface (HDI). The proof of HDI is of various degrees of clinical significance utilizing a formal assessment method. Pharmacodynamics HDIs are also recognized for the inherent pharmacological effects of phytochemicals.", "The main concern is to mainly highlight the most common Herb-Drug interaction concerning most common herbal-drug interaction.", "The current review mainly focused on the literature available for the drug-drug interaction in case of most commonly used herbal drugs. Some of the evidence has been compiled through extensive literature survey on different database platforms like Pubmed, Embase and google scholar supporting our review in every aspect of drug-drug interactions reported in these ten years, our team has also tried of including some previous studies by researchers.", "The data reliability of such data can be questionable in terms of authenticity, but due to availability of some documented case reports, the risk for HDI will be evaluated in a not-clinical health evaluation step of the product development cycle for the increasing number of plant-based pharmacological\u00a0activities. The primary concern which was seen to be worried was the self-medication of many herbal drugs which are readily available OTC for the consumers. Available evidence on HDIs is inadequate for therapeutic uses; thus, it may need further clinical studies. This is valid from in vitro trials, and clinical research tested for herbal-drugs interactions.", "The purpose of this article was to gather data to cater an evidence-based discussion and information for providing complete knowledge to existing patients and consumers regarding herbal drug-drug interactions, would also help them a brief knowledge that what can go wrong in case of herbal-drug interaction, in conclusion, we also found that there is still no basic guideline defining the drug-drug interactions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Arora", "ForeName": "Govind", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Arora", "ForeName": "Anureet", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Choudhary", "ForeName": "Vikram", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kamlija", "ForeName": "Mahesh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kamlija", "ForeName": "Hema", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Altern Ther Health Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9502013", "ISSNLinking": "1078-6791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herb-Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "4"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33038080", "AT6470"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
