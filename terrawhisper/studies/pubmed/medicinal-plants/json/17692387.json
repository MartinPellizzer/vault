The situation for tuberculosis (TB) infection is equally problematic. Once considered a \"treatable\" disease for which eradication was predicted, TB has re-emerged as highly lethal, multi-drug resistant strains after the outbreak of AIDS. Worldwide, the disease causes millions of deaths annually. Similarly, treatments for chronic inflammatory diseases such as arthritis have been impeded due to the potentially lethal side effects of the new and widely prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compounds. Thais have utilized bioresources from plants and some microorganisms for medicine for thousands of years. Because of the need for new drugs to fight malaria and TB, with radically different chemical structures and mode of actions other than existing drugs, efforts have been directed towards searching for new drugs from bioresources. This is also true for anti-inflammatories. Although Thailand is considered species-rich, only a small number of potential bioresources has been investigated. This article briefly describes the pathogenesis of 2 infectious diseases, malaria and TB, and modern medicines employed in chemotherapy. Diversities of Thai flora and fungi and their chemical constituents with antagonistic properties against these 2 diseases are described in detail. Similarly, anti-inflammatory compounds, mostly cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, are also described herein to demonstrate the potential of Thai bioresources to provide a wide array of compounds for treatment of diseases of a different nature."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, School of Bioresources and Technology, Conservation Ecology Program, 83 Moo 8, Thakham, Bangkhuntien, Bangkok, Thailand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gale", "ForeName": "George A", "Initials": "GA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kirtikara", "ForeName": "Kanyawim", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pittayakhajonwut", "ForeName": "Pattama", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sivichai", "ForeName": "Somsak", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thebtaranonth", "ForeName": "Yodhathai", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thongpanchang", "ForeName": "Chawanee", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vichai", "ForeName": "Vanicha", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacol Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "7905840", "ISSNLinking": "0163-7258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimalarials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimalarials"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Malaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Tuberculosis"}], "NumberOfReferences": "287"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17692387", "10.1016/j.pharmthera.2007.03.016", "S0163-7258(07)00081-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
