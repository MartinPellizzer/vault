It restricts the pharmacological efficacy in numerous neurological diseases, including brain tumors. A major functional constituent of BBB is P-glycoprotein, which is also a major obstacle for effective chemotherapy of brain tumors. An appealing strategy is to selectively modulate BBB function using P-glycoprotein inhibitors. We assessed 57 chemically defined compounds derived from medicinal plants used in traditional Chinese medicine for their potential to inhibit P-glycoprotein. Nine phytochemicals inhibited P-glycoprotein in porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (PBCECs) and multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000 cells as shown by a calcein fluorescence assay. The cytotoxicity of the 57 phytochemicals was measured by a growth inhibition assay. Seven compounds inhibiting P-glycoprotein at lower doses were cytotoxic to drug-sensitive parental CCRF-CEM cells at higher doses. Of them, five were not cross-resistant to CEM/ADR5000 cells (baicalein, bufalin, glybomine B, deoxyserofendic acid, and shogaol). Bufalin was chosen as a lead compound. Of a further six bufalin-related compounds, scillarenin showed improved features in comparison to bufalin. It was cytotoxic to cancer cells at a nanomolar range. COMPARE and hierarchical cluster analyses of microarray-based mRNA expression were used to investigate determinants of sensitivity or resistance of the bufalin-related compounds downstream of P-glycoprotein. CEM/ADR5000 cells were not cross-resistant, but were collaterally sensitive towards scillarenin. Finally, scillarenin inhibited P-glycoprotein in PBCECs. Taken together, these data show that scillarenin is a potential novel candidate for P-glycoprotein inhibition at BBB, and, thereby, may improve the efficacy of therapy regimens in treating brain diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mahringer", "ForeName": "Anne", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karamustafa", "ForeName": "Shirin", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klotz", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kahl", "ForeName": "Stefan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Konkimalla", "ForeName": "V Badireenath", "Initials": "VB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yifen", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Junsong", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hai-Yang", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boechzelt", "ForeName": "Herbert", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Xiaojiang", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bauer", "ForeName": "Rudolf", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fricker", "ForeName": "Gert", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Efferth", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Genomics Proteomics", "NlmUniqueID": "101188791", "ISSNLinking": "1109-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood-Brain Barrier"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20656985", "7/4/191"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
