In bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), PAL is encoded by a family of three genes. We show here by RNase protection with gene-specific probes that these genes are expressed differentially during development and in response to different environmental cues. While all three genes are expressed at high levels in roots, only PAL1 and PAL2 are expressed in shoots and only PAL1 is expressed in leaves. Strikingly, PAL2 is expressed at very high levels in petals, where PAL1 is only very weakly expressed and PAL3 is not expressed. All three genes are induced by mechanical wounding of hypocotyls, but fungal infection only activates PAL1 and PAL3. Illumination of etiolated hypocotyls activates PAL1 and PAL2 but not PAL3. Corresponding differential patterns of synthesis of specific PAL polypeptide isoforms were observed by two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of in vitro translation products encoded by RNA isolated from hypocotyls stimulated by light, wounding, or infection. The specific isoforms encoded by transcripts of the three PAL genes were identified by inhibition of synthesis in vitro with gene-specific anti-sense transcripts followed by comparative two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of the pattern of translation products. These data indicate that selective expression of PAL genes encoding functional variants is governed by a complex set of regulatory networks for developmental and environmental control of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Salk Institute for Biological Studies, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92037."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "X W", "Initials": "XW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dron", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cramer", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dixon", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lamb", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia-Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.3.1.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia-Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nucleic Acid Hybridization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2760071", "S0021-9258(18)71704-3"]}}]}
