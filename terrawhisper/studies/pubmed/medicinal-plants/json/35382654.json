It is pertinent to mention here that this is the first report to stain these compounds in which dereplication approach based on GC-MS was applied to target unknown compounds ACH-6 and ACH-8 in <i>A. calamus L.</i> Derelpication approaches based on GC-MS is very useful technique in the area of drug discovery and have eminence potential to identify known and unknown compounds present in extracts of medicinal important plants. This technique can be used to expedite the process of purification of unknown compounds from different matrixes. The isolated compounds were identified with the help of inbuilt library search which reveals the presence of 17 known and 4 unknown compounds. Further, the structure elucidation of all isolated compounds was done using spectroscopy techniques. Also, the structure of ACH-6 was further confirmed by using the single-crystal X-ray diffraction technique."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Analytical Chemistry Lab, Natural Product Chemistry Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Chetan", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Srinagar, India."}], "LastName": "Akhter", "ForeName": "Sabiyah", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Analytical Chemistry Lab, Natural Product Chemistry Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India."}], "LastName": "Satti", "ForeName": "Naresh Kumar", "Initials": "NK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, University of Jammu, Jammu, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Vivek Kumar", "Initials": "VK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Genetic Resource and Agrotech Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India."}], "LastName": "Meena", "ForeName": "Siya Ram", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vishwakarma", "ForeName": "Ram", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Srinagar, India."}], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "Qazi Parvaiz", "Initials": "QP"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9961-8382"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Analytical Chemistry Lab, Natural Product Chemistry Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India."}], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Mahendra Kumar", "Initials": "MK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "CCW02D961F", "NameOfSubstance": "pentadecanoic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acorus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "20"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35382654", "10.1080/14786419.2022.2061482"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
