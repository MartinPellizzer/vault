In the present study, its efficacy and safety compared with those of Umckamin in the treatment of acute bronchitis were evaluated in phase III, randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial design.<b>Methods:</b> A total of 246 acute bronchitis patients were randomized to receive either HL301 (600\u2009mg/day) or Umckamin (333\u2009mg/day) for seven days. The primary outcome was the difference in their baseline (visit 2) and end of treatment (visit 3) bronchitis severity score (BSS). Other efficacy variables included the change in each BSS component (cough, sputum, dyspnea, chest pain, and crackle), response rate, improvement rate, and satisfaction rate with treatment.<b>Results:</b> A full analysis set and per protocol set analysis of both groups revealed that the difference of BSS between visit 2 and visit 3 in the HL301 and Umckamin group was not significantly different (4.58\u2009\u00b1\u20091.79 versus 4.29\u2009\u00b1\u20091.88, <i>p\u2009=\u2009.37</i> and 4.60\u2009\u00b1\u20091.81 versus 4.33\u2009\u00b1\u20091.88, <i>p\u2009=\u2009.42</i>, respectively). The change in five BSS components (cough, sputum, dyspnea, chest pain, and crackle) of the HL301 and Umckamin groups did not differ after treatment. HL301 or Umckamin treated participants showed an equal level of response, improvement, and satisfaction rates with treatment. Both the HL301 group and Umckamin group showed the same safety profile.<b>Conclusions:</b> HL301 (600\u2009mg/day) was as effective and safe as Umckamin (333\u2009mg/day) in treating acute bronchitis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Chung-Ang University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Won-Young", "Initials": "WY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pulmonology and Critical Care Medicine, Kyung Hee University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Myung Jae", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4533-7937"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Seoul St Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Rhee", "ForeName": "Chin Kook", "Initials": "CK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Sang Yeub", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, Bucheon, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Do Jin", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University Kangnam Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Dong Gyu", "Initials": "DG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Chang-Min", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Deog Kyeom", "Initials": "DK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Yee Hyung", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Hanyang University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Ho Joo", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Chung-Ang University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jae Yeol", "Initials": "JY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial, Phase III", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Multicenter Study", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Res Opin", "NlmUniqueID": "0351014", "ISSNLinking": "0300-7995"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cough"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dyspnea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31855086", "10.1080/03007995.2019.1706044"]}}]}
