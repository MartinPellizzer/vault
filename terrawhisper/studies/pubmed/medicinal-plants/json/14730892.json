The RT-PCR method was used for measuring the mRNA expression of ICAM-1 and CD18.", "The adhesion rate between VEC304 and neutrophil was increased with treatment of lipopolysaccharide(LPS). EsA (3 - 12 x 10(-6) mumol.L-1) was shown to inhibit the high cellular adhesion induced by LPS. A further investigation of adhesion molecules mRNA expression was undertaken using semi-quantitative reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results of RT-PCR from VEC304 and human neutrophil treating with LPS showed that ICAM-1 and CD18 mRNA expressions were higher than those of normal cells, while this increased expression of ICAM-1 and CD18 mRNA was remarkably attenuated by the addition of EsA.", "EsA was found to inhibit the increased adhesion rate induced by LPS. Moreover, LPS induced high expression of ICAM-1 and CD18 was inhibited with treatment of EsA. It might be involved in the mechanisms of anti-inflammation of EsA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China. zhyxiao@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Zhen-yu", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jun-ping", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Da-zhi", "Initials": "DZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Qin-yue", "Initials": "QY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CD18 Antigens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "126547-89-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "65497-07-6", "NameOfSubstance": "esculentoside A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SMK8R7TGJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleanolic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "CD18 Antigens"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phytolacca"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Umbilical Veins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14730892"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
