However, a lack of information on the adverse effects of these plants raises questions on their safety and possible adverse side effects. This study was undertaken to evaluate the potential toxic effects of fenugreek seeds on pregnant mice and foetal development.", "Lyophilized aqueous extract from fenugreek seeds (LAE-FS) was administered to mated female mice during the entire period of pregnancy, at doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day. Females were examined for standard parameters of reproductive performance. Foetuses were weighed and examined for externally visible malformations.", "In pregnant females, there were no obvious symptoms of toxicity, LAE-FS-related deaths or macroscopic abnormalities. Developmental toxicity in offspring included an increase in the foetal death rate, a decrease in the litter size, and a reduction in the foetal body weight. In addition there was an increase in the incidence of morphological abnormalities.", "Based on these results, it was concluded that fenugreek seeds extract may have deleterious toxic effects on reproductive performance and potential teratogenic effects in foetuses."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
