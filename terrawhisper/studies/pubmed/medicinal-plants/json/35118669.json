The results show that the best process for preparing deer oil powder is: the solids account for 25% of the system content, the wall material Whey Milk Protein Isolate-Maltodextrin ratio is 1:5, the Sodium Stearyl Lactate-Glycerides of Monostearate and Distearate compound emulsifier content is 0.8%, the ratio is 1:1, and the deer oil accounts for 30% of the solid content, and the spray drying inlet temperature is 180\u00b0C. Deer oil powder can reduce total stomach injury, gastric mucosal congestion area, and injury score index. Without affecting the blood lipid level, it can reduce the content of Myeloperoxidase, enhance the activity of Superoxide Dismutase and Glutathione Peroxidase, and has good antioxidant activity. Enhance the expression of defense factors Estradiol, Epidermal Growth Factor, and Somatostatin. At the same time, it reduces the levels of Interleukin-1\u03b2 and Interleukin-6 pro-inflammatory cytokines in gastric tissue and enhances the expression of anti-inflammatory factors Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-10. These results indicate that the gastric protection mechanism of deer oil powder may be related to the enhancement of mucosal defense factors, inhibition of inflammation, and oxidative stress. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study screened the optimal formula for preparing microencapsulated deer oil powder and proved for the first time that deer oil powder has a strong gastroprotective effect on ethanol-induced acute gastric injury in rats. The gastric protective mechanism of deer oil powder is mainly to reduce oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokine accumulation and to increase the content of defense factors. Therefore, deer oil powder can be used as a new source of gastric treatment drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Yun-Shi", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhi-Man", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Engineering, Changchun University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chang", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Mu", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Bo", "ForeName": "Pan-Pan", "Initials": "PP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zi", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1889-4984"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Yin-Shi", "Initials": "YS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "125161034-2021-016", "Agency": "Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund for institute of special animal and plant sciences caas", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "018YFC1706604", "Agency": "National Key Research and Development Program of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2018 yfc1706605", "Agency": "National Key Research and Development Program of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "7706045", "ISSNLinking": "0145-8884"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Powders"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Deer"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Powders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Asensio, C.
