Seeds of these plants were selected due to their traditional value for medicinal use. Analgesic activity was determined in mice by Eddy's Hot plate and tail flick method, while anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by hind paw edema method. Both seed extracts produced highly significant analgesic effects comparable to standard drugs at all three doses by both methods. The extract of C. lanatus showed significant anti-inflammatory activity at 100 mg while showed highly significant activity at 200 mg between 3 to 24 hours as compared to standard drugs. Both extracts did not reveal any mortality up to 1000mg/kg, while there was also no change in normal the gross behavior pattern of the animals at the dose of 50 and 100mg/kg, however there was increase in passivity, sedation and startle response at 200mg/kg. Analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of extracts may be due to presence of cucurbitacin A, B or E in both seeds which are thought to inhibit COX 2. Results indicate that seeds of C. melo and C. lanatus may be effectively used as adjuvant analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents in situation of chronic pain and inflammation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Wahid", "ForeName": "Shahana", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan/Faculty of Pharmacy, Ziauddin University, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Rafeeq Alam", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Sciences, College of Science and Health Professions, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Feroz", "ForeName": "Zeeshan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ikram", "ForeName": "Rahila", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9000-07-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Carrageenan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carrageenan"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Citrullus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cucumis melo"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Nociceptive Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pain Threshold"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "56"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33191228"]}}]}
