And the genetic diversity of 22 C. morifolium accessions was tested by RAPD marks. The NTSYS software was used to analyze the marks.", "26 10-mer arbitrary primers were found to acquire polymophic results. A total of 233 bands were amplified, of which 89.7% bands were found to be polymophic. 8.04 polymophic bands were amplified by each primer on the average. The results of cluster analysis by using UPGMA method showed that all the tested accessions could be differentiated by RAPD marks.", "There actually existed much genetic diversity at the molecular level among the germplasm resources of C. morifolium. RAPD marks could be effective tools to construct DNA fingerprintings of C. morifolium. The differences between the tested chrysanthemums are related to the environments. However, it was affected by genetic facters more significantly."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Nanjing Agricultural University, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wen-bin", "Initials": "WB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Qiao-sheng", "Initials": "QS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chang-lin", "Initials": "CL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Chrysanthemum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cluster Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16548159"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
