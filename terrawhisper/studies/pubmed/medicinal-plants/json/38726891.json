In tomato, SlGRAS27 is the putative ortholog of RAM1 (here named SlRAM1), but has not yet been characterized. A reduced colonization of the root and an impaired arbuscule formation were observed in the SlRAM1 silenced plants, confirming the functional conservation of the RAM1 ortholog in tomato . However, unexpectedly, SlRAM1 overexpressing (UBIL:SlRAM1) plants also showed a decreased mycorrhizal colonization. Analysis of non-mycorrhizal UBIL:SlRAM1 roots revealed an overall regulation of AM-related genes and a reduction of strigolactone biosynthesis. Moreover, the external application of the strigolactone analogue GR244DO almost completely reversed the negative effects of SlRAM1 overexpression on the frequency of mycorrhization. However, it only partially recovered the pattern of arbuscule distribution observed in control plants. Our results strongly suggest that SlRAM1 has a dual regulatory role during mycorrhization and, apart from its recognized action as a positive regulator of arbuscule development, SlRAM1 is also involved in different mechanisms for the negative regulation of mycorrhization, including the repression of strigolactone biosynthesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
