The purpose of the present work was to estimate the quantity and quality of clinical laboratory wastes in the city of Ilam, Iran. In this cross-sectional study, randomly eight clinical laboratories including five in private sector and three governmental clinical laboratories were selected for sampling according to the purpose of the study. The results showed that the total amount of waste generation was 27,700.90\u00a0kg/year. The average amount of health-care wastes generation in Ilam city was 0.2\u00a0kg/person/year. The portions of general, pathologic, sharp, infectious, and pharmaceutical and chemical wastes were 37, 5, 2, and 56% (by weight), respectively. As a considerable amount of waste is generated in clinical laboratories of Ilam city, therefore, it is necessary to implement integrated plans for the proper management of these wastes. Thus, sufficient training and education programs must be developed for all clinical staffs and that the existing training and education procedures should also be promoted."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mazloomi", "ForeName": "Sajad", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, Faculty of Health, Social Development and Health Promotion Research Center, Gonabad University of Medical Sciences, Gonabad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zarei", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alasvand", "ForeName": "Shokoufeh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Farhadi", "ForeName": "Atefeh", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nourmoradi", "ForeName": "Heshmatoallah", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. bonyadiz@mums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Bonyadi", "ForeName": "Ziaeddin", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Medical Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Medical Waste Disposal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Laboratories"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Medical Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medical Waste Disposal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Waste Manag. 2005;25(6):622-5", "ArticleIdList": ["15946839"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Manage. 2006 Jul;80(2):107-15", "ArticleIdList": ["16338054"]}, {"Citation": "Waste Manag Res. 2006 Apr;24(2):105-17", "ArticleIdList": ["16634225"]}, {"Citation": "Waste Manag. 2008;28(6):1049-56", "ArticleIdList": ["17451931"]}, {"Citation": "Waste Manag Res. 2008 Jun;26(3):297-303", "ArticleIdList": ["18649579"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2009 Feb 15;407(5):1527-35", "ArticleIdList": ["19108872"]}, {"Citation": "Waste Manag. 2009 Apr;29(4):1376-82", "ArticleIdList": ["19157838"]}, {"Citation": "Waste Manag. 2010 Aug-Sep;30(8-9):1683-9", "ArticleIdList": ["20156673"]}, {"Citation": "Waste Manag. 2011 Apr;31(4):754-66", "ArticleIdList": ["21186116"]}, {"Citation": "Waste Manag Res. 2012 Jun;30(6):601-6", "ArticleIdList": ["21930518"]}, {"Citation": "Waste Manag. 2012 Jul;32(7):1442-52", "ArticleIdList": ["22365264"]}, {"Citation": "Waste Manag Res. 2012 Jun;30(6):596-600", "ArticleIdList": ["22617472"]}, {"Citation": "J Infect Public Health. 2014 May-Jun;7(3):192-8", "ArticleIdList": ["24629349"]}, {"Citation": "Waste Manag. 2017 Mar;61:539-546", "ArticleIdList": ["28162901"]}, {"Citation": "Data Brief. 2018 Mar 19;18:620-628", "ArticleIdList": ["29900216"]}, {"Citation": "Data Brief. 2018 Sep 01;20:1115-1123", "ArticleIdList": ["30229127"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30847579", "10.1007/s10661-019-7345-z", "10.1007/s10661-019-7345-z"]}}]}
