Each of these polysaccharides contained a large proportion of GalA together with neutral sugars consisting mainly of Rha, Ara, and Gal. Digestion with endo-alpha-(1----4)-polygalacturonase indicated that AR-2IIa-IIc each contained a large proportion of enzyme-sensitive polygalacturonan regions, and that AR-2IId contained a large proportion of enzyme-resistant regions. When AR-2IId was de-esterified, it became sensitive to the enzyme. These polysaccharides also contained small proportions of enzyme-resistant regions (PG-1) which were rich in neutral sugars. Methylation analysis and base-catalysed beta-elimination studies suggested that each PG-1 contained a rhamnogalacturonan moiety in which 2,4-disubstituted Rha was attached to 4-substituted GalA through position 2 of Rha. Carboxyl-reduction and methyl- and de-esterification of these polysaccharides modulated their anti-complementary activities. Digestion with endo-alpha-(1----4)-polygalacturonase decreased the activities of AR-2IIa and -2IIb, but not those of AR-2IIc and -2IId. Although PG-1 fractions from AR-2IIa-IIc were more active than the original polysaccharides, oligogalacturonide fragments obtained by enzymic digestion had weak or negligible activity. AR-2IIa-IIc expressed their anti-complementary activities mainly via the classical pathway, but AR-2IId and each PG-1 expressed their activities via both the classical and alternative pathways."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oriental Medicine Research Center, Kitasato Institute, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kiyohara", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cyong", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Carbohydr Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0043535", "ISSNLinking": "0008-6215"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Complement Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Esterification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3242805", "10.1016/0008-6215(88)84007-2", "0008-6215(88)84007-2"]}}]}
