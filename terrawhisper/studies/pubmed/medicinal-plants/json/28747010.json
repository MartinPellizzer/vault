Emblica officinalis Gaertn. or Phyllanthus emblica Linn (family Phyllanthaceae) has been explained extensively and well documented for its therapeutic efficacies in indigenous system of medicine, in India. Every part of this plant possesses high medicinal value but fruits are the most valuable part in folklore and therapeutic uses. The polyphenols found in E.officinalis, especially tannins and flavonoids are key responsible elements for major bioactivities. E.officinalis is one of the major component in various health tonics, also exerts synergistic effects in enhancing the medicinal efficacy. E.officinalis exhibits broad spectrum of pharmacological activities through various mode of actions including antioxidant, anticancer, immunomodulator, anti-inflammatory, cyto-protective properties etc. Medical practitioners across the globe also advocated its application in managing diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, several types of cancer, liver disorders, arthritis, gingivitis, wound healing etc. The present review analysed and summarized the pharmacological actions, experimental studies and clinical trials of E. officinalis with emphasis on its immuno-enhancer, antiinflammatory and anticancer activities and possible mechanism of actions to provide future directions in translating these findings clinically."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.
