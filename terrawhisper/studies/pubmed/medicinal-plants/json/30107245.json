(AIL) have been used for wound healing, and to treat urinary tract infection, hepatitis, enteritis, dysentery, nyctalopia, conjunctivitis, urticaria, and furuncle. However, no scientific investigation has been conducted on its wound healing potential.", "To investigate the effects of AIL extract on wound healing, isolate the active constituent and reveal the possible mechanism of enhancing wound healing.", "The circular excision wound healing model was used to evaluate in vivo wound-healing activity. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was applied to assess inflammatory cells infiltration, angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, collagen remodeling, and skin appendages generation. Sirius red-picric acid staining was employed for quantitative analysis of the ratio of collagen I/III. Immunohistochemical staining for CD68, CCR7 (CD197), CD163, TGF-\u03b21 and \u03b1-SMA was performed to determine macrophages phenotypes transition (M1-to-M2) and prove the scar-improving effect of AIL on wound healing.", "We successfully isolated the active constituent (Sub-Fr0.2) for wound healing from AIL extract, circular excision wound healing experiment and hematoxylin & eosin staining showed Sub-Fr0.2 has a significant promoting effect on wound healing. Results of sirius red-picric acid staining demonstrated a reduced ratio of collagen I/III in the Sub-Fr0.2 group as compared with the vehicle group. Immunohistochemical staining for CD68, CCR7 (CD197), and CD163 in the Sub-Fr0.2 group exhibited an elevated speed of macrophages transiting from M1 phenotype to M2 phenotype, when compared with the vehicle group. Besides, the expression of TGF-\u03b21 and \u03b1-SMA were inhibited on wounds treated with the ointment containing Sub-Fr0.2.", "Leaves of AIL and its active constituent (Sub-Fr0.2) effectively promoted wound healing and reduced scar formation, this efficacy might be exerted by accelerating macrophages phenotypes transition and inhibiting TGF-\u03b21 and \u03b1-SMA expression."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
