The present study aimed to investigate the effect of this mushroom on airways patency.", "The composition of L. rhinocerotis TM02 cultivar was analyzed. Organ bath experiment was employed to study the bronchodilator effect of Lignosus rhinocerotis cold water extract (CWE) on rat isolated airways. Trachea and bronchus were removed from male Sprague-Dawley rats, cut into rings of 2\u202fmm, pre-contracted with carbachol before adding CWE into the bath in increasing concentrations. To investigate the influence of incubation time, tissues were exposed to intervals of 5, 15 and 30\u202fmin between CWE concentrations after pre-contraction with carbachol in subsequent protocol. Next, tissues were pre-incubated with CWE before the addition of different contractile agents, carbachol and 5-hydroxytrptamine (5-HT). The bronchodilator effect of CWE was compared with salmeterol and ipratropium. In order to uncover the mechanism of action of CWE, the role of beta-adrenoceptor, potassium and calcium channels was investigated.", "Composition analysis of TM02 cultivar revealed the presence of \u03b2-glucans and derivatives of adenosine. The extract fully relaxed the trachea at 3.75\u202fmg/ml (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and bronchus at 2.5\u202fmg/ml (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). It was observed that lower concentrations of CWE were able to fully relax both trachea and bronchus but at a longer incubation interval between concentrations. CWE pre-incubation significantly reduced the maximum responses of carbachol-induced contractions (in both trachea, p\u202f=\u202f0.0012 and bronchus, p\u202f=\u202f0.001), and 5-HT-induced contractions (in trachea, p\u202f=\u202f0.0048 and bronchus, p\u202f=\u202f0.0014). Ipratropium has demonstrated a significant relaxation effect in both trachea (p\u202f=\u202f0.0004) and bronchus (p\u202f=\u202f0.0031), whereas salmeterol has only affected the bronchus (p\u202f=\u202f0.0104). The involvement of \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor and potassium channel in CWE-mediated airway relaxation is ruled out, but the bronchodilator effect was unequivocally affected by influx of calcium.", "The bronchodilator effect of L. rhinocerotis on airways is mediated by calcium signalling pathway downstream of G<sub>\u03b1q</sub>-coupled protein receptors. The airway relaxation effect is both concentration- and incubation time-dependent. Our findings provide unequivocal evidence to support its traditional use to relieve asthma and cough."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier GmbH.
