The aim of the review: This review article documents and critically assesses the current status of the traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology of the Albizia species.", "All provided literatures on the Albizia species were searched using the electronic databases (e.g. Web of Science, Elsevier, Springer, PubMed, ACS, CNKI, Google Scholar, and Baidu Scholar), books, and theses with keywords of 'Albizia' and 'Albizzia'.", "Albizia species have been used for melancholia, insomnia, wounds, fever, abscesses, diabetes, headache, stomachache, diarrhea, cough, rheumatism, snake bite, malaria, and parasitic infection in traditional and local medicine. These plants mainly contain triterpenoid saponins, flavonoids, lignanoids, alkaloids, phenolic glycosides, etc. Albizia species have been demonstrated to possess various pharmacological activities. Among them, the antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antifertility, antianxiety, antidepressant, and anti-fever properties are consistent with the traditional and local applications of the Albizia species.", "The traditional and local uses of Albizia species have been partially demonstrated by the pharmacological investigation. However, some traditional applications have not been assessed scientifically due to incomplete methodologies and ambiguous findings. Moreover, no clinical evidences support the health benefits of these plants. The systematic and comprehensive preclinical studies and clinical trials are still required to verify the pharmacological activities, clinical efficacy, and safety of Albizia species."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
