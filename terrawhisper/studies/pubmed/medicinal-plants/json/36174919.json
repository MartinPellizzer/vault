These products are often utilized by patients with allergies in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, their conventional medical therapies. Despite the wide use of these modalities, many clinicians often have limited knowledge and training in their use. It is important for health care providers to know the safety and risks of these products that their patients may use. This Clinical Commentary reviews the side effects and adverse reactions of several natural products commonly used by patients with allergies and gives an overview of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements for manufacturing, advertising and distribution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
