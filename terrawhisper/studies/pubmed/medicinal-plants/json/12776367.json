The inner inhibitory substances showed stronger inhibitory effect on the germination of Brassica chinensis seeds than the growth of its younger roots. The Rf 0.1 section of the ether extract of Acanthopanax senticosus fruit coats showed the strongest inhibitory activity on the germination of Brassica chinensis seeds and the growth of its young roots. The rough extracts of Acanthopanax senticosus fruits could inhibit the activity of the (alpha-amylase in the process of wheat seeds germination. The dormanvy of Acanthopanax senticosus seeds is related to the inhibitory substances with high activity in Acanthopanax senticosus fruits and seeds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Forest Resource and Environment College, Northeast Forestry University Harbin, 150040 Heilongjiang, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Brassica"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Eleutherococcus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12776367"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
