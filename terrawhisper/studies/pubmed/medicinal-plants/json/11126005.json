In 1935 Mothes was appointed Professor of botany in K\u00f6nigsberg and moved to the University of Halle in 1950, where he was the director of three departments. He proved to be a good director and an ideal teacher. In 1954 Mothes became president of the Leopoldina. The scientific accomplishments are represented by 391 papers and 56 dissertations. His work provided the basis for modern phytochemical research of plants. Mothes had approximately 800 students; 56 completed their dissertations under his supervision and 24 became professors. The research conditions in Halle were very good because Mothes had received a new Institute of Biochemistry of Plants. The research school of Mothes enjoyed important public and social recognition not only in the GDR but throughout the world."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Geschichte der Pharmazie der Philipps-Universit\u00e4t Marburg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Friedrich", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Biography", "Historical Article", "Journal Article", "Portrait"], "VernacularTitle": "Wissenschaftliche Schulen in der Pharmazie.
