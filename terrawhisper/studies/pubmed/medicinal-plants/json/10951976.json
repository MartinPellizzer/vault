Dogs in 2 groups were treated for 91 days (8 received 500 mg, PO, q 8 h [1,500 mg/d], and 6 received 100 mg, PO, q 8 h [300 mg/d]). The control group of 6 dogs did not receive medication. Effects of treatment on prostatic volume, prostatic weight, prostatic histologic characteristics, radiographic and ultrasonographic assessment of prostatic size, results of CBC, serum biochemical analyses, and urinalysis, serum testosterone concentration, and semen characteristics were determined. At the termination of the study, all dogs were euthanatized, and necropsies were performed. Investigators conducting tests and interpreting results were not aware of treatment group of each dog.", "Treatment did not affect prostatic weight, prostatic volume, or prostatic histologic scores, libido, semen characteristics, radiographs of the caudal portion of the abdomen, prostatic ultrasonographs, or serum testosterone concentrations. Results of CBC, serum biochemical analyses or urinalysis, and body weights did not change during treatment.", "Treatment with an extract of S repens for 91 days did not significantly affect the prostate gland of dogs. Adverse effects were not evident. Although products containing extracts of S repens are widely advertised for men with prostatic hyperplasia, beneficial or harmful effects of this plant extract were not found in dogs with prostatic hyperplasia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Small Animal Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens 30602, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barsanti", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Finco", "ForeName": "D R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mahaffey", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fayrer-Hosken", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Crowell", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thompson", "ForeName": "F N", "Initials": "FN", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shotts", "ForeName": "E B", "Initials": "EB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Vet Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0375011", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9645"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3XMK78S47O", "NameOfSubstance": "Testosterone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Biopsy"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Chemical Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dog Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Libido"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Prostate"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Prostatic Hyperplasia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiography"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Radioimmunoassay"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Semen"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Testosterone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrasonography"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Urinalysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10951976", "10.2460/ajvr.2000.61.880"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
