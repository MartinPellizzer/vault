The ionic liquid 1-vinyl-3-ethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([VEIm][BF<sub>4</sub>]) was used as the functional monomer and aesculetin was used as the template molecule in a crowding environment, which was made up of a tetrahydrofuran solution of polystyrene. The ionic liquid MIPs that were prepared in the crowding environment displayed an enhanced imprinting effect. NMR peak shifts of active hydrogen of aesculetin suggested that interaction between the functional monomer and the template could be increased by the use of a crowding agent in the self-assembly process. The retention and selectivity of aesculetin were affected greatly by high molecular crowding, the amount of high molecular weight crowding agent, and the ratio of [VEIm][BF<sub>4</sub>] to aesculetin. The optimal MIPs were used as solid-phase extraction sorbents to extract aesculetin from Cichorium glandulosum. A calibration curve was obtained with aesculetin concentrations from 0.0005 to 0.05 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> (correlation coefficient R <sup>2</sup> of 0.9999, y = 1519x + 0.0923). The limit of quantification was 0.12 \u03bcg mL<sup>-1</sup>, and the limit of detection was 0.05 \u03bcg mL<sup>-1</sup>. The absolute recovery of aesculetin was (80 \u00b1 2)% (n = 3), and the purity of aesculetin was (92 \u00b1 0.5)% (n = 5). As a conclusion, molecular crowding is an effective approach to obtain ionic liquid MIPs with high selectivity even in a polar solvent environment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Man", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Ya Kun", "Initials": "YK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Xi", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China. zhaoshengliu@sohu.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China. zhaoshengliu@sohu.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhao Sheng", "Initials": "ZS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China. haji@ms.xjb.ac.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China. haji@ms.xjb.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Aisa", "ForeName": "Haji Akber", "Initials": "HA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "U1303202", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Anal Bioanal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101134327", "ISSNLinking": "1618-2642"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29260284", "10.1007/s00216-017-0760-5", "10.1007/s00216-017-0760-5"]}}]}
