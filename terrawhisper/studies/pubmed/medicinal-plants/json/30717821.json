DNA barcoding methods for botanical identification must be adequately validated to meet regulatory compliance. <i>Objective:</i> The goal of this study is to provide a validation protocol for a two-tiered DNA barcoding method that aims to identify raw botanicals. <i>Methods:</i> A barcode database was computationally validated to define the barcode combinations that can unambiguously identify botanicals in the database. A maximum variation sampling technique was used to capture a wide range of perspectives relating to DNA barcode-based botanical identification, including plant parts and species distance, for the experimental validation. Twenty-two authenticated botanicals were purposively sampled from different plant parts-covering both closely related and distantly related species-to validate the two-tiered DNA barcoding method. The performance of the method was assessed on accuracy, precision, ruggedness, and uncertainty. <i>Results:</i> High accuracy (100%) and precision (1.0) were obtained from the validation samples. The method was also found to be rugged and have acceptable uncertainty. <i>Conclusions:</i> The method was validated and suitable for DNA-based identification of botanical raw materials listed in the current database. <i>Highlights:</i> This work will provide support guidance for manufacturers and regulatory policy makers to implement equivalent validated and compliant DNA-based testing in quality control processes to improve botanical raw material identification and authentication."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Herbalife Nutrition, 950 West 190th St, Torrance, CA 90502."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Zhengfei", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Herbalife Manufacturing, LLC, 20481 Crescent Bay Dr, Lake Forest, CA 92630."}], "LastName": "Thompson", "ForeName": "Christopher M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Herbalife Nutrition, 950 West 190th St, Torrance, CA 90502."}], "LastName": "Chua", "ForeName": "Tiffany", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Herbalife Nutrition, 950 West 190th St, Torrance, CA 90502."}], "LastName": "Babajanian", "ForeName": "Silva", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Herbalife Nutrition, 950 West 190th St, Torrance, CA 90502."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yanjun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Herbalife Manufacturing, LLC, 20481 Crescent Bay Dr, Lake Forest, CA 92630."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Quanyin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Herbalife Nutrition, 950 West 190th St, Torrance, CA 90502."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Herbalife Nutrition, 950 West 190th St, Torrance, CA 90502."}], "LastName": "Swanson", "ForeName": "Gary", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Validation Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J AOAC Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9215446", "ISSNLinking": "1060-3271"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30717821", "10.5740/jaoacint.18-0130"]}}]}
