Rooting was inhibited when the microshoots were cultured under higher concentration of auxins. The microshoots cultured on medium supplemented with NAA induced large number of thin root hairs with friable calluses within 6-7 days. Peroxidase activity was determined during root induction (0-day to the 10th day at every 2 day interval) from microshoots derived in vitro. The activity was minimum in the inductive phase (primary) and at the maximum level during the root initiative phase. These finding may be useful in monitoring the rooting behaviour in microshoots derived from different subculture and peroxidase activity as a marker for root initiation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Biotechnology Division, Plant Tissue Culture Laboratory, Regional Plant Resource Centre, Bhubaneswar-751 015, India. grrout@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rout", "ForeName": "G R", "Initials": "GR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Palai", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Costa Rica", "MedlineTA": "Rev Biol Trop", "NlmUniqueID": "0404267", "ISSNLinking": "0034-7744"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Butyrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6U1S09C61L", "NameOfSubstance": "indoleacetic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Butyrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Zingiber officinale"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12189828"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
