The present study aimed to review the current scientific evidence regarding the pharmacological effects of C. procera extracted phytochemicals and possible research opportunities as complementary and alternative medicine. Scientific publications were searched in various electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Springer, Wiley, and Mendeley) using the following search terms: Calotropis procera, medicinal plants, toxicity, phytochemical characterization, and biological effects. Collected data showed that cardenolides, steroid glycoside and flavonoids are the main classes of phytochemicals identified in C. procera latex and leaves. In addition, lignans, terpenes, coumarins, and phenolic acids have been reported. These metabolites have been correlated with their biological activities, including mainly antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumoral, hypoglycemic, gastric protective, anti-microbial, insecticide, anti-fungal, anti-parasitic, among others. However, some of the studies were carried out with only a single dose or with a high dose not achievable under physiological conditions. Therefore, the validity of C. procera biological activity may be questionable. Not less important to highlight are the risks associated with its use and the possibility of accumulation of heavy metals that can be toxic. Furthermore, there are no clinical trials with C. procera to date. In conclusion, the need of bioassayguided isolation of bioactive compounds, bioavailability and efficacy, as well as pharmacological and toxicity studies, are needed using in vivo models and clinical trials in order to support the traditionally claimed health benefits."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, 05508-270, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Rabelo", "ForeName": "Ana Carolina Silveira", "Initials": "ACS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science & Technology, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, TX 77843-2253, United States."}], "LastName": "Noratto", "ForeName": "Giuliana", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Laboratory of Stem Cell, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, 05508 270, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Borghesi", "ForeName": "Jessica", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Maranh\u00e3o, Campus S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds- Monte Castelo, Maranh\u00e3o, 65030-005, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Souza Fonseca", "ForeName": "Adriano", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Maranh\u00e3o, Campus S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds- Monte Castelo, Maranh\u00e3o, 65030-005, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Cantanhede Filho", "ForeName": "Ant\u00f4nio Jos\u00e9", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Maranh\u00e3o, Campus S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds- Monte Castelo, Maranh\u00e3o, 65030-005, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Costa Carneiro", "ForeName": "Fernando Jos\u00e9", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Pathology, State University of Maranh\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, State of Maranh\u00e3o, 65055310, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Abreu-Silva", "ForeName": "Ana L\u00facia", "Initials": "AL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, 05508-270, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Miglino", "ForeName": "Maria Ang\u00e9lica", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Procera"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Latex"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Calotropis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apocynaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Latex"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "47"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37282633", "10.2174/1568026623666230606162556", "CTMC-EPUB-132343"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
