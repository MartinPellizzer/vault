Intragastric administration of the extract significantly decreased plasma lipid levels of both triglyceride and cholesterol but increased liver triglyceride content. Liver weight and plasma activities of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase were not affected by a single administration. Prolonged treatment did not further decrease plasma lipid level but caused further increases in liver triglyceride content and weight. The lower plasma cholesterol activity of C. comose extract was found to be essentially associated with elevation of plasma HDL cholesterol level, increased excretion of fecal cholesterol and bile salt. The increase persisted throughout the period of treatment. These results suggest that C. comosa has hypolipidemic action. It exerts hypocholesterolemic activity by accelerating mobilization of cholesterol from peripheral tissues into liver and enhancing excretion of cholesterol and bile salt into feces."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok."}], "LastName": "Piyachaturawat", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Teeratagolpisal", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Toskulkao", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Suksamrarn", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Artery", "NlmUniqueID": "7508494", "ISSNLinking": "0098-6127"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticholesteremic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticholesteremic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9209696"]}}]}
