From ancient times, these plants have been important condiments for traditional Mediterranean cuisine and remedies in folk medicine. Nowadays, they are considered as important factors for food quality and safety, due to prevention of various deteriorative factors like oxidations and microbial spoilage. EOs have different therapeutic benefits (e.g. antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antifungal), while BACs mostly affect nutritive, chemical, microbiological, and sensory quality of foods. Currently, many plant extracts are used for functional (healthy) foods, which additionally fuels consumer and industrial interest in sustainable and non-toxic routes for their production. EO yields from dried plants are below 5%. Their extraction is strongly dependent on the hydrophobic or lipophilic character of target molecules, hence the common use of organic solvents. Similarly, BACs encompass a wide range of substances with varying structures as reflected by their different physical/chemical qualities. Thus, there is a need to identify optimal non-toxic extraction method(s) for isolation/separation of EO/BCs from plants. Various innovative non-thermal extractions (e.g. ultrasound-, high-pressure-, pulsed electric fields assisted extraction, etc.) have been proposed to overcome the above mentioned limitations. These techniques are \"green\" in concept, as they are shorter, avoid toxic chemicals, and are able to improve extract yields and quality with reduced consumption of energy and solvents. This research provides an overview of such extractions of both BAC and EOs from Mediterranean herbs, sustained by innovative and non-conventional energy sources."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
