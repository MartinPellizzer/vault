By employing dextran 100\u00a0kDa as model compound, the effects of ionic liquid content, solvent/anti-solvent volume, and temperature on its recovery efficiency were investigated systematically. The ability of these ionic liquids to precipitate dextran 100\u00a0kDa, increases with the elongation of ethylene glycol polymer chain. The established ionic liquid-based precipitation system was successfully applied to selectively precipitate polysaccharides from water extracts of three traditional Chinese medicines and the precipitation could be achieved in about 15\u00a0min. In addition, the different precipitation responses of acidic, neutral, and basic polysaccharides in the ionic liquid-based precipitation system and theoretical calculations both suggested that the selective precipitation of polysaccharides was probably mediated by interaction between ionic liquids and polysaccharides. The proposed strategy facilitated the isolation and purification of polysaccharides and may trigger a novel application of ionic liquids in carbohydrate research."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
