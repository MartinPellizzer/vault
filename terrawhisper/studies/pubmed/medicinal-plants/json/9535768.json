The results of the present study reveal a good correlation between chemopreventive efficacies of garlic OSCs and their inductive effects on the expression of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO), an enzyme implicated in the detoxification of activated quinone metabolites of BP. Treatment of mice with DADS and DATS, which are potent inhibitors of BP-induced forestomach tumorigenesis, resulted in a statistically significant increase (2.4- and 1.5-fold, respectively) in forestomach NQO activity. In addition, DADS and DATS were much more potent inducers of forestomach NQO activity than DAS, which is a weak inhibitor of BP-induced forestomach tumorigenesis than the former compounds. Propyl-group containing OSCs (DPS and DPDS), which do not inhibit BP-induced tumorigenesis, did not affect forestomach NQO activity. Similar to forestomach, a good correlation was also observed between effects of these OSCs against BP-induced pulmonary tumorigenesis and their effects on NQO expression in the lung. For example, treatment of mice with DAS, which is a potent inhibitor of BP-induced pulmonary tumorigenesis, resulted in about 3.2-fold increase in pulmonary NQO activity. On the other hand, this activity was increased by about 1.5-fold upon DATS administration, which does not inhibit BP-induced cancer of the lung. In conclusion, our results suggest that induction of NQO may be important in anti-cancer effects of garlic OSCs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Research Laboratory, Mercy Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219, USA. ssingh@mercy.pmhs.org"}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "S V", "Initials": "SV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Srivastava", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zaren", "ForeName": "H A", "Initials": "HA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Orchard", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA 55589", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "NlmUniqueID": "0372516", "ISSNLinking": "0006-291X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0ZO1U5A3XX", "NameOfSubstance": "diallyl trisulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3417WMA06D", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5HI47O6OA7", "NameOfSubstance": "diallyl disulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60G7CF7CWZ", "NameOfSubstance": "allyl sulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.5.2", "NameOfSubstance": "NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I7K169J70F", "NameOfSubstance": "n-propyl disulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q6J7GNX8F9", "NameOfSubstance": "dipropyl sulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T75W9911L6", "NameOfSubstance": "Propane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disulfides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Induction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Propane"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9535768", "10.1006/bbrc.1998.8352", "S0006-291X(98)98352-8"]}}]}
