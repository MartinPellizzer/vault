Leaves, stems, roots, and achenes were assayed separately. An attempt was made to relate the phototoxic activity of specific compounds to their chemical structures. Most composites tested were not phototoxic against Candida, but many were antibiotic. The antibiotic activity also appears to be caused by polyacetylenes. Of 65 sequiterpene lactones assayed, only a few were found to be antibiotic, and only one, glaucolide G, was phototoxic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Towers", "ForeName": "G H", "Initials": "GH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wat", "ForeName": "C K", "Initials": "CK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Graham", "ForeName": "E A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bandoni", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "G Q", "Initials": "GQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mitchell", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lam", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Lloydia", "NlmUniqueID": "0376626", "ISSNLinking": "0024-5461"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkynes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Alkynes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Americas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Candida albicans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["73121"]}}]}
