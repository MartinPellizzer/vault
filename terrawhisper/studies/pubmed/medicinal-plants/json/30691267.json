Microbial synthesis of the critical common intermediate N-methylpyrrolinium would allow for sustainable production of N-methylpyrrolinium-derived alkaloids. Here, we achieve the production of N-methylpyrrolinium both in Escherichia coli and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by employing the biosynthetic genes derived from three different plants. Specifically, the diamine oxidases (DAOs) from Anisodus acutangulus were first characterized. Then, we produced N-methylpyrrolinium in vitro from l-ornithine via a combination of the three cascade enzymes, ornithine decarboxylase from Erythroxylum coca, putrescine N-methyltransferase from Anisodus tanguticus, and DAOs from A. acutangulus. Construction of the plant biosynthetic pathway in E. coli and S. cerevisiae resulted in de novo bioproduction of N-methylpyrrolinium with titers of 3.02 and 2.07 mg/L, respectively. Metabolic engineering of the yeast strain to produce N-methylpyrrolinium via decreasing the flux to the product catabolism pathway and improving the cofactor supply resulted in a final titer of 17.82 mg/L. This study not only presents the first microbial synthesis of N-methylpyrrolinium but also lays the foundation for heterologous biosynthesis of N-methylpyrrolinium-derived alkaloids. More importantly, the strains constructed herein can serve as important alternative tools for identifying undiscovered pathway enzymes with a synthetic biology strategy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai 200032 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100039 , China."}], "LastName": "Ping", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai 200032 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100039 , China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiaodong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai 200032 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100039 , China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Baofu", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai 200032 , China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai 200032 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100039 , China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Wenping", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Medicinal Plant Biotechnology, College of Pharmacy , Zhejiang Chinese Medical University , Hangzhou , Zhejiang 310053 , China."}], "LastName": "Kai", "ForeName": "Guoyin", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai 200032 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100039 , China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Zhihua", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4803-3333"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai 200032 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100039 , China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Youli", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Synth Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101575075", "ISSNLinking": "2161-5063"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrroles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16032-02-3", "NameOfSubstance": "1-methyl-delta(1)-pyrrolinium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.3.21", "NameOfSubstance": "Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrroles"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30691267", "10.1021/acssynbio.8b00483"]}}]}
