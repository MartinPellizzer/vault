Our previous investigations on the whole plant of Achillea millefolium L. resulted in the discovery of two chlorine-containing guaianolide sesquiterpenoids. In the present study, a LC\u2012MS tracking strategy based on the characteristic isotropic peak of atomic chlorine was employed to isolate nine undescribed chlorine-containing guaianolide sesquiterpenoids, Millefolactons B1-B9, from A. millefolium L.. The structures of these compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic data analysis, and the corresponding absolute configurations were determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography and ECD data analysis. Millefolactons B2-B7 displayed inhibitory activities against LPS-induced NO release in BV-2 microglial cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
