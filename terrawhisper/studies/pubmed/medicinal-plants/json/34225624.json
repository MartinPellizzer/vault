Therefore, discovering and developing well-tolerated and non-toxic antituberculosis regimens are directly needed to defend the variants strains of M. tuberculosis and, alternatively, support WHO's 'END-TB' campaign.", "Alternatively, phytochemicals from various common and medicinal plants have always been vital therapeutic agents since the primitive era. Thus, proper scientific documentation as diversity, potency, structure, drug-chemistry and overall critical analysis are essential tools to accelerate the phytochemical-based anti-TB drug development.", "In the present review, we have used some specific keywords such as 'antituberculosis phytochemicals', &; antituberculosis phytochemicals from plant source&; 'natural products against tuberculosis' in Google, PubMed, ScienceDirect sites to get more appropriate research publications. Further, based on lower minimum inhibitory concentration within fifty \u03bc g/mL, a total of twohundred- twenty-one bioactive anti-TB phytochemicals were selected for critical drug-chemistry and structural activity relationship analyses to select most potential 'lead candidate' for anti-TB drug development.", "Based on lower concentration, abietane, ethyl-p-methoxycinnamate, ergosterol peroxide, mono-O-methyl curcumin isoxazole, 7-methyljuglone, 12-demethylmulticaulin, 12-methyl-5- dehydroacetylhorminone, tryptanthrin, etc. are some of the potential anti-TB phytochemicals. Interestingly, existing and clinical drug pipelines for TB contain several active phytochemical pharmacophores illustrated from the structural analysis.", "Therefore, updated experimental documentation and structural-cum-critical drugchemistry analysis on isolated antituberculosis phytochemicals at the primary level are more beneficial for drug developers, R&D centres, and pharmaceutical companies to accelerate anti-TB drug development using phytochemicals."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Microbiology and NCDs, ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar-751023, Odisha, India."}], "LastName": "Swain", "ForeName": "Shasank S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Microbiology and NCDs, ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar-751023, Odisha, India."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Tahziba", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Microbiology and NCDs, ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar-751023, Odisha, India."}], "LastName": "Pati", "ForeName": "Sanghamitra", "Initials": "S"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "NO.3/1/3/PDF(21)/HRD-2019-2", "Agency": "ICMR-Post Doctoral Fellowship-Indian Council of Medical Research, Department of Health Research, Govt. of India", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Tuberculosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34225624", "10.2174/1568026621666210705170510", "CTMC-EPUB-116467"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
