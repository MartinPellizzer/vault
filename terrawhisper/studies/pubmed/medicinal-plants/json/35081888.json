Herbal medication has demonstrated promising and effective potential against various diseases. Herbal and phytoconstituent medications are gaining popularity globally and many people are adopting herbal remedies to deal with different health issues. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics, due to the development of antimicrobial resistance, poses an unprecedented problem for human civilization. Bacterial infections are difficult to cure because of the propensity of microbes to acquire resistance to a wide range of antimicrobial drugs. New compounds are being explored and quantified for possible antibacterial activity with little or no side effects. Researchers are investigating the range of therapeutic plants mentioned in Unani, Ayurveda, and Siddha around the globe. Known and commonly acclaimed global databases such as PubMed, Research Gate, Science Direct, Google Scholar were searched using different search strings such as Indian medicinal plants, multidrug resistance (MDR), thin layer chromatography (TLC), antimicrobials, and Synergism were used in diverse combinations to reclaim numerous citations associated with this area. Thus, the current review aims to shed a light on the information of medicinal plants as a potential foundation of herbal drugs and elucidate how synergism and TLC bioautography play a crucial role in finding antimicrobial compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, 110025, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioactive Natural Product Laboratory, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, 110062, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, 110025, India."}], "LastName": "Abass", "ForeName": "Sageer", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioactive Natural Product Laboratory, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, 110062, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, 110025, India."}], "LastName": "Parveen", "ForeName": "Rabea", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, 110025, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioactive Natural Product Laboratory, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, 110062, India."}], "LastName": "Irfan", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioactive Natural Product Laboratory, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, 110062, India."}], "LastName": "Jan", "ForeName": "Bisma", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, 110025, India."}], "LastName": "Husain", "ForeName": "Syed Akhtar", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioactive Natural Product Laboratory, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, 110062, India."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Sayeed", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Multiple"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "35"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35081888", "10.2174/1389201023666220126115656", "CPB-EPUB-120394"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
