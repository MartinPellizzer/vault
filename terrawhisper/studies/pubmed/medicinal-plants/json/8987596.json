A lambda phage cDNA library constructed from poly(A+) RNA from maturing seeds was screened with the ECI gene thus obtained as a probe and characterized by DNA sequencing. The cloned ECI cDNA comprised 737 nucleotides and one open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide chain of 203 amino acids including a signal peptide composed of 24 amino acids. An expression plasmid was designed for export of the recombinant inhibitor into the periplasm. For this purpose, the cDNA fragment encoding matured ECI was ligated into the NcoI and BamHI sites following the pel B signal sequence in the expression vector pET-22b and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). However, this attempt failed as the recombinant inhibitor caused the formation of inclusion bodies in E. coli cells as a heterologous preprotein (SR-ECI), with the pel B upstream leader. SR-ECI was made soluble and renatured by refolding and reoxidation, and subsequently processed with pronase to give rise to recombinant ECI (R-ECI) that had an extra methionine residue attached to the N-terminal amino acid of ECI. Purified R-ECI inhibited chymotrypsin almost as strongly as authentic ECI."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biochemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kuramitsu", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Iwanaga", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamasaki", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kimura", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biosci Biotechnol Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9205717", "ISSNLinking": "0916-8451"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ECI protein, Erythrina variegata"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Serine Proteinase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chymotrypsin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Chymotrypsin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Erythrina"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Code"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genomic Library"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Serine Proteinase Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8987596", "10.1271/bbb.60.1469"]}}]}
