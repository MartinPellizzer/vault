Here, in vitro shoot cultures of the medicinal plant Sutherlandia frutescens were used to study the impact of three abiotic stresses (nitrogen availability, drought and salinity), primarily on l-canavanine synthesis. This compound, a non-protein amino acid, is amongst those metabolites linked to the health benefits of Sutherlandia extracts. Nitrogen supplied to microplants positively correlated with canavanine levels, exhibited by a fourfold reduction when nitrates provided were halved. Although the biomass generated was lowered under these conditions, a higher capacity for rooting (52%) in comparison to the controls (37%) became evident. Only a small increase of the canavanine content in microplants growing on 100mM NaCl medium was detected, indicating that salinity stress was not a major limitation on cavanine production, but that it played more of a role in vitro on plantlet morphogenesis. Similarly, PEG as a supplement had little to no effect on canavanine synthesis. We conclude that a deeper understanding of the nutritional requirements for the agricultural crop management of S. frutescens, which serves the herbal products industry, is needed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010.
