Male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 9 weeks (160-200 g) were administered with streptozotocin (STZ, 50mg/kg) intraperitoneally to induce experimental diabetes. The Cichorium intybus whole plant was exhaustively extracted with 80% ethanol, concentrated at 40 degrees C using a rotavapor and freeze dried to get powder. Hypoglycemic effects of CIE were observed in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in which, a dose of 125 mg of plant extract/kg body weight exhibited the most potent hypoglycemic effect. Moreover, daily administration of CIE (125 mg/kg) for 14 days to diabetic rats attenuated serum glucose by 20%, triglycerides by 91% and total cholesterol by 16%. However, there was no change in serum insulin levels, which ruled out the possibility that CIE induces insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells. In addition, hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity (Glc-6-Pase) was markedly reduced by CIE when compared to the control group. The reduction in the hepatic Glc-6-Pase activity could decrease hepatic glucose production, which in turn results in lower concentration of blood glucose in CIE-treated diabetic rats. In conclusion, our results support the traditional belief that Cichorium intybus could ameliorate diabetic state."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 119260, Singapore. phspnp@nus.edu.sg"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pushparaj", "ForeName": "P N", "Initials": "PN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Low", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manikandan", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "B K H", "Initials": "BK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9100L32L2N", "NameOfSubstance": "Metformin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose-6-Phosphatase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cichorium intybus"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucose Tolerance Test"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose-6-Phosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Metformin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17197141", "10.1016/j.jep.2006.11.028", "S0378-8741(06)00614-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
