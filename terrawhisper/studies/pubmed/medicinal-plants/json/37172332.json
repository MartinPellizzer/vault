It is a multifactorial disease under the control of various genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. Insufficiency of estrogen hormone, leads to postmenopausal osteoporosis. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), despite being the most effective treatment, it is associated with the risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular disorders. This review seeks to compile the most recent information on medicinal plants and natural compounds used to treat and prevent postmenopausal osteoporosis. Furthermore, the origin, chemical constituents and the molecular mechanisms responsible for this therapeutic and preventive effect are also discussed. Literature research was conducted using PubMed, Science direct, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Different plant extracts and pure compounds exerts their antiosteoporotic activity by inhibition of RANKL and upregulation of OPG. RANKL signaling regulates osteoclast formation, characterized by increased bone turnover and osteoprotegrin is a decoy receptor for RANKL thereby preventing bone loss from excessive resorption. In addition, this review also includes the chemical structure of bioactive compounds acting on NF\u03baB, TNF \u03b1, RUNX2. In conclusion, we propose that postmenopausal osteoporosis could be prevented or treated with herbal products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
