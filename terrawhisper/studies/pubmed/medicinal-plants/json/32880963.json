Here, we report the functional characterization of an inducible potato TPS gene encoding bulnesol/elemol synthase (StBUS/ELS). The expression of StBUS/ELS in potato leaves was significantly induced in response to both bacterial (Pseudomonas syringae) and fungal (Alternaria solani) infection as well as methyl jasmonate treatment, indicating its role in defense. The leaves exhibited the highest StBUS/ELS expression followed by the stem with least and similar expression in tuber, sprout and root. Recombinant StBUS/ELS catalyzed the formation of different sesquiterpenes by utilizing farnesyl diphosphate as substrate, and the monoterpene geraniol from geranyl diphosphate. Among the sesquiterpenes formed by StBUS/ELS, elemol was the predominant product followed by \u03b1-bulnesene, bulnesol and \u03b2-elemene. Further gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of StBUS/ELS assay products at different injection temperatures revealed elemol and bulnesol as the major products at 275 and 200/150\u00b0C, respectively, without much change in the levels of minor products. This indicated thermal rearrangement of bulnesol into elemol at higher temperatures. Transient overexpression of StBUS/ELS in potato leaves conferred tolerance against the growth of bacteria P. syringae and Ralstonia solanacearum, and the fungus A. solani. Further, expression analysis of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes in StBUS/ELS overexpressing leaves showed no significant change in comparison to control, indicating a direct involvement of StBUS/ELS enzymatic products against pathogens. Overall, our study suggested that StBUS/ELS is a pathogen-inducible TPS encoding bulnesol/elemol synthase and could provide a direct role in defense against biotic stress in potato."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Plant Biology and Biotechnology Lab, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre, Bengaluru, 560065, India."}], "LastName": "Dwivedi", "ForeName": "Varun", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Naturalist-Inspired Chemical Ecology, National Centre for Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, GKVK Campus, Bengaluru, 560065, India."}], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "Srinivas", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Plant Biology and Biotechnology Lab, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre, Bengaluru, 560065, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, 201 002, India."}], "LastName": "Bomzan", "ForeName": "Dikki P", "Initials": "DP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Plant Biology and Biotechnology Lab, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre, Bengaluru, 560065, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Sarma R", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Organic and Medicinal Chemistry Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, 700032, India."}], "LastName": "Shanmugam", "ForeName": "Pragadheesh V", "Initials": "PV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Naturalist-Inspired Chemical Ecology, National Centre for Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, GKVK Campus, Bengaluru, 560065, India."}], "LastName": "Olsson", "ForeName": "Shannon B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9418-8918"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Plant Biology and Biotechnology Lab, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre, Bengaluru, 560065, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, 201 002, India."}], "LastName": "Nagegowda", "ForeName": "Dinesh A", "Initials": "DA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "SR/FT/LS-038/2009", "Agency": "Department of Science and Technology, Govt of India", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Physiol Plant", "NlmUniqueID": "1256322", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9317"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkyl and Aryl Transferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L92AJ7G06I", "NameOfSubstance": "elemol"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Alternaria solani"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Alkyl and Aryl Transferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alternaria"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum tuberosum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Attaran E, Rost\u00e1s M, Zeier J (2008) Pseudomonas syringae elicits emission of the terpenoid (E, E)-4, 8, 12-trimethyl-1, 3, 7, 11-tridecatetraene in Arabidopsis leaves via jasmonate signaling and expression of the terpene synthase TPS4.
