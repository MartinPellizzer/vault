Medicinal plants (MPs) are known to be beneficial to animal health and exert functional roles in livestock due to their phytogenic compounds with antimicrobial, immunostimulatory, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory activities. Some MP has been reported to be anti-methanogenic and can effectively lower ruminants' enteric methane emissions. This review overviews trends in MP utilization in ruminants, their bioactivity and their effectiveness in lowering enteric methane production. It highlights the MP regulatory mechanism and the gaps that must be critically addressed to improve its efficacy. MP could reduce enteric methane production by up to 8-50% by regulating the rumen fermentation pathway, directing hydrogen toward propionogenesis, and modifying rumen diversity, structure, and population of the methanogens and protozoa. Yet, factors such as palatability, extraction techniques, and economic implications must be further considered to exploit their potential fully."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
