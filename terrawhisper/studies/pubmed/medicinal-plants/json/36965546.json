(stem bark), Anacardium occidentale L. (stem bark), Azadirachta indica A.Juss (leaves), Enantia chlorantha Oliv. (stem bark), Khaya senegalensis A.Juss (stem bark) Mangifera indica L. (stem bark), and Nauclea latifolia Sm. (stem bark) are used for treating malaria in southwest Nigeria. Surveys revealed that these plants are also employed for treating symptoms of malaria and cerebral malaria in the region.", "In this study, the effects of freeze-dried extracts of these plants were investigated on synthetic hemozoin (HZ)-induced neuroinflammation, neuronal damage, and increased permeability of brain microvascular endothelial cells.", "Effects of freeze-dried plant extracts were investigated on neuroinflammation by measuring levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in culture supernatants, while in-cell western assays were used to measure protein levels of iNOS and NLRP3. Effects on HZ-induced neurotoxicity and ROS generation was measured using MTT and DCFDA assays, respectively. HZ-induced permeability of hCMEC/D3 endothelial cells was determined using the in vitro vascular permeability assay kit.", "The extracts produced significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) reduction in TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, MCP-1, RANTES and iNOS/NO production in HZ-stimulated BV-2 microglia. Pre-treatment with 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of A. boonei, A. indica, A. occidentale, E. chlorantha and M. indica also resulted in the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation. Pre-treatment with A. indica produced, A. occidentale, M. indica and A. boonei reduced HZ-induced increased NLRP3 protein expression. HZ-induced increased caspase-1 activity was also reduced by A. boonei, A. occidentale, A. indica, E. chlorantha, and M. indica. Freeze-dried extracts of A. boonei, A. occidentale, A. indica and M. indica produced neuroprotective effect in HT-22 neuronal cells incubated with HZ by preventing HZ-induced neurotoxicity, ROS generation, DNA fragmentation and caspase 3/7 activity. Inhibition of HZ-induced increase in permeability of human hCMEC/D3 brain endothelial cells was also observed with A. boonei, A. occidentale, A. indica and M. indica, while reducing the release of TNF\u03b1 and MMP-9.", "These results suggest that A. boonei, A. occidentale, A. indica and M. indica are neuroprotective through inhibition of neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and increased permeability of blood brain barrier. The outcome of the study provides pharmacological evidence for the potential benefits of plants as herbal treatments for cerebral malaria symptoms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
