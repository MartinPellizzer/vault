All assays have their advantages and limitations as a screening tool. No single <i>in vitro</i> assay is considered ideal for predicting estrogenic action in a complex <i>in vivo</i> system. To assess agonistic activities of several medicinal herbs on the estrogen receptor (ER) and their metabolic alteration, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Performance-Based Test Guideline No. 455 <i>in vitro</i> assay was performed in this study using recombinant VM7Luc4E2 cells in combination with rat liver S9 fractions. Ethanol extracts of medicinal herbs showed binding affinities for ER-<i>\u03b1</i> and ER-<i>\u03b2</i> at different levels. However, luciferase reporter assay using VM7Luc4E2 cells revealed that only two test extracts [<i>Pueraria lobata</i> root extract (PLE); <i>Glycyrrhiza glabra</i> root extract (GGE)] exhibited ER transcriptional activity when their activities were compared with the response by 17<i>\u03b2</i>-estradiol. Importantly, incubation of PLE or GGE with rat liver S9 fractions increased their ER transcriptional activities, in particular when phase I metabolic enzymes were activated. Puerarin and glabridin were the most abundant isoflavones found in PLE and GGE, respectively. The present results demonstrate that PLE and GGE possess potential as ER agonists with their metabolic activation. This study also suggests that the application of OECD <i>in vitro</i> assay with rat liver S9 fraction is an efficient screening tool to evaluate estrogenic activities of natural substances."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Chung-Ang University, Anseong, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hee-Seok", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Chung-Ang University, Anseong, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Tae Hee", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Industry Academy Cooperation Foundation; Andong National University, Andong, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Dong-Hee", "Initials": "DH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "R&D Research Innovation Team, Kwang Dong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Yun", "ForeName": "Beom Sik", "Initials": "BS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "R&D Research Innovation Team, Kwang Dong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Ki Won", "Initials": "KW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "R&D Research Innovation Team, Kwang Dong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jin Soo", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "R&D Research Innovation Team, Kwang Dong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Goo", "ForeName": "Young Tae", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Biotechnology; Andong National University, Andong, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jun Ho", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Estrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Estrogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Estrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptional Activation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "20"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34939859", "10.1089/jmf.2021.K.0119"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
