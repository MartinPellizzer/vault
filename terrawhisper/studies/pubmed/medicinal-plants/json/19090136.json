The fourth group which served as control received distilled water only. On the 29th day, the rats which had been fasted overnight were dissected under chloroform anaesthesia and blood was collected directly from their hearts. The blood was allowed to clot and centrifuged to obtain the serum which was kept in a refrigerator at -4 degrees C until used for analysis. Appropriate Commercial kits (Randox Laboratories, U.K.) were used to evaluate the serum activity or concentration of the following parameters:alanine and aspartate transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, high density lipoproteins, total and conjugated bilirubin and total proteins. The fruit extract of the plant significantly elevated the serum concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides, total proteins, at the three dose levels. The 500 and 1000 mg kg(-1) doses increased the concentrations of HDL and conjugated bilirubin. While only 100 and 500 mg kg(-1) doses of the extract reduced the level of total bilirubin. The hypercholesterolemic, hyperproteinemic, hypertriglyceridemic and hyper conjugated bilirubinemic effect of this extract coupled with the increased activity of alkaline phosphatase suggest that the fruit of Telfaira occidentalis may not be safe for consumption. This is quite contrary to the nutritional usage of the leaf and seed of this plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Uyo, Nigeria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eseyin", "ForeName": "Olorunfemi A", "Initials": "OA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ekpo", "ForeName": "Arit", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Idem", "ForeName": "Iboro", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Igboasoiyi", "ForeName": "Arnold C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Edoho", "ForeName": "Edoho J", "Initials": "EJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101247723", "ISSNLinking": "1028-8880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cucurbitaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19090136", "10.3923/pjbs.2007.3240.3242"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
