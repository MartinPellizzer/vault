Investigation of the possible activity of their major constituents with the cardiovascular-related receptors may lead to developing new therapeutics. It also may prevent unwanted side effects and drug-herb interactions.", "A list of 243 volatile molecules (mainly monoterpene and sesquiterpene) was prepared from a literature survey in Scopus and PubMed (2000-2019) on hydrosols and essential oils which are used for Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) and its risk factors (diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia). The PDB files of the receptors (229 native PDB files) included alpha-glucosidase, angiotensin- converting enzymes, beta-2 adrenergic receptor, glucocorticoid, HMG-CoA reductase, insulin, mineralocorticoid, potassium channel receptors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptoralpha, were downloaded from Protein Data Bank. An in silico study using AutoDock 4.2 and Vina in parallel mode was performed to investigate possible interaction of the molecules with the receptors. Drug likeliness of the most active molecules was investigated using DruLiTo software.", "Spathulenol, bisabolol oxide A, bisabolone oxide, bergapten, bergamotene, dill apiole, pcymene, methyl jasmonate, pinocarveol, intermedeol, \u03b1-muurolol, S-camphor, ficusin, selinen-4-ol, iso-dihydrocarveol acetate, 3-thujanone, linanool oxide and cadinol isomers made a better interaction with some of the named receptors. All of the named molecules had an acceptable dug likeliness except for \u03b1-bergamotene. In addition, all of the named molecules had the ability to pass the bloodbrain barrier and it is possible to produce unwanted side effects.", "Some ingredients of essential oils might be active on cardiovascular-related receptors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Medicinal Plants Processing Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hamedi", "ForeName": "Azadeh", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sakhteman", "ForeName": "Amirhossein", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moheimani", "ForeName": "Seyed Mahmoud", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Cardiovasc Hematol Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101266881", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5257"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "PPAR alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Cell Surface"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Glucocorticoid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Mineralocorticoid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.10.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptor, Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.20", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Glucosidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.17.23", "NameOfSubstance": "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aromatherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperlipidemias"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "PPAR alpha"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptor, Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Cell Surface"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Glucocorticoid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Mineralocorticoid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Glucosidases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32386501", "10.2174/1871524920666200510013039", "CHAMC-EPUB-106491"]}}]}
