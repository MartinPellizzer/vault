To test whether this could be due, at least in part, to an increase in plasma membrane (PM) ATPase activity, PM vesicles were isolated from primary leaves by phase partitioning and used to characterize PM ATPase activity and changes in response to light. ATPase activity was characterized as magnesium ion dependent, vanadate sensitive, and slightly stimulated by potassium chloride. The pH optimum was 6.5, the Km was approximately 0.30 millimolar ATP, and the activity was about 60% latent. PM vesicles were prepared from leaves of plants grown for 11 days in dim red light (growing slowly) or grown for 10 days in dim red light and then transferred to bright white-light for 1 day (growing rapidly). For both light treatments, ATPase specific activity was approximately 600 to 700 nanomoles per milligram protein per minute, and the latency, Km, and sensitivity to potassium chloride were also similar. PM vesicles from plants grown in complete darkness, however, exhibited a twofold greater specific activity. We conclude that the promotion of leaf growth and proton excretion by bright white light is not due to an increase in ATPase specific activity. Light does influence ATPase activity, however; both dim red light and bright white light decreased the ATPase specific activity by nearly 50% as compared with dark-grown leaves."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA."}], "LastName": "Linnemeyer", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Van Volkenburgh", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cleland", "ForeName": "R E", "Initials": "RE"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "DCB-8517349", "Acronym": "DC", "Agency": "NIDCD NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cations, Divalent"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proton Pumps"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3WHH0066W5", "NameOfSubstance": "Vanadates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "660YQ98I10", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "81AH48963U", "NameOfSubstance": "Molybdenum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.3.14", "NameOfSubstance": "Proton-Translocating ATPases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Azides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cations, Divalent"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Molybdenum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Proton Pumps"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Proton-Translocating ATPases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vanadates"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Anal Biochem. 1978 Jun 15;87(1):206-10", "ArticleIdList": ["98070"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1983 May;72(1):7-15", "ArticleIdList": ["16662984"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1983 Jun;72(2):356-61", "ArticleIdList": ["16663006"]}, {"Citation": "FEBS Lett. 1983 May 30;156(1):11-4", "ArticleIdList": ["6221943"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1981 Sep;68(3):521-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16661950"]}, {"Citation": "Methods Enzymol. 1974;31:734-46", "ArticleIdList": ["4418023"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1982 Nov 10;257(21):12826-30", "ArticleIdList": ["6215404"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1987 Nov;85(3):693-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16665762"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1986 Jun;81(2):542-7", "ArticleIdList": ["16664853"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1982 Oct;70(4):1120-4", "ArticleIdList": ["16662624"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11537474", "PMC1077436", "10.1104/pp.94.4.1671"]}}]}
