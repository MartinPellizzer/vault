This paper describes only the ethnoveterinary practices used in the poultry sub-sector. A four stage process was used to conduct the research and document these ethnoveterinary practices. 28 ethnoveterinary respondents were identified using a modified Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) technique, the student essay method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with these respondents as well as with 30 veterinarians, 27 extension officers and 19 animal health assistants/agricultural officers, and the 7 key respondents that they identified. 5 participatory workshops were then held with 55 of the respondents interviewed to discuss the data generated from the interviews and to determine dosages for some of the plants mentioned. 12 plant species were used to treat 4 categories of health problems common to poultry production. Aloe vera, Bryophyllum pinnatum, Citrus sp. and Momordica charantia were the main medicinal plants being used."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Veterinary Medicine, University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago."}], "LastName": "Lans", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Prev Vet Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8217463", "ISSNLinking": "0167-5877"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Education, Veterinary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Focus Groups"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poultry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poultry Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Schools, Veterinary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trinidad and Tobago"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Veterinary Medicine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9646336", "10.1016/s0167-5877(97)00055-x", "S0167-5877(97)00055-X"]}}]}
