Apigenin (4',5,7,-trihydroxyflavone (5,7-dihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one), molecular formula C\u2081\u2085H\u2081\u2080O\u2075, is a flavonoid present in many fruits and vegetables, primarily in citrus fruits, apples, parsley and celery leaves. It is also found in some medicinal plants, including chamomile flowers, thyme, oregano, peppermint, lemon balm and yarrow, as a 7-O-glycoside with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. In recent years it has attracted a great deal of interest as a bioactive substance reported to have anticancer properties. According to recent literature data, apigenin is able to reduce cancer cell glucose uptake, inhibit remodeling of the extracellular matrix, inhibit cell adhesion molecules that participate in cancer progression and hinder the development of blood vessels needed by growing tumors. It is reported to protect against a wide variety of cancers. The mechanism of anticancer activity is still under investigation and further research is needed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland."}], "LastName": "Kowalczyk", "ForeName": "Adam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Students' Pharmacognosy Society, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland."}], "LastName": "Bodalska", "ForeName": "Agnieszka", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Students' Industrial Pharmacy Society, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland."}], "LastName": "Miranowicz", "ForeName": "Marta", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Pharmacy, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland."}], "LastName": "Kar\u0142owicz-Bodalska", "ForeName": "Katarzyna", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Adv Clin Exp Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101138582", "ISSNLinking": "1899-5276"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose Transporter Type 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7V515PI7F6", "NameOfSubstance": "Apigenin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Apigenin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Extracellular Matrix"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose Transporter Type 1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29211364", "10.17219/acem/41978"]}}]}
