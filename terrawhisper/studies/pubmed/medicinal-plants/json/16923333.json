Two different methods were used to assess the scavenging effects of the extracts on hydroxyl radical (. OH): HPLC method was used for quantitation of . OH by oxy-radical trapping of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) to form DMPO-OH adducts in Fe2+-EDTA-H2O2 system. To confirm the HPLC data, .OH was also measured by spectrophotometry using a commercial detection kit. The anti-lipid peroxidation effects of the extracts in microsomes of rat brain, liver and kidney induced by ascorbate-NADPH were determined by thiobarbituric acid (TBA) method. The protective effects of the extracts on peroxide hydrogen (H2O2)-induced oxidative damage in SH-SY5Y cells were investigated by assessing cell viability assay, the level of lipid peroxidation, and the lactate dehydrogenase(LDH) release.", "Both SalB and EGb 761 were able to scavenge O2-. and . OH, inhibit lipid peroxidation of microsomes, and protect SH-SY5Y cells against H2O2-induced oxidative damage. However, the concentration of SalB was far lower than that of EGb 761 when a similar effect was obtained.", "The antioxidant efficiency of SalB was greater than that of EGb 761. These results suggest that SalB, like EGb 761, has promising potential in treating oxidative damage-derived neurodegenerative disorders."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropharmacology, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chang-suo", "Initials": "CS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jin-feng", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Nai-hong", "Initials": "NH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jun-tian", "Initials": "JT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzofurans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19FUJ2C58T", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginkgo biloba extract"}, {"RegistryNumber": "C1GQ844199", "NameOfSubstance": "salvianolic acid B"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzofurans"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroblastoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16923333", "10.1111/j.1745-7254.2006.00378.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
