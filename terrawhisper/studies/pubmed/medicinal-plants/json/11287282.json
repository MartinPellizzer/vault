The expression of p53 (>10% positive cells) was found in 38.5% of the cases. The frequency of expression in betel chewers alone and betel chewer with tobacco use were 37.9% (11/29) and 25%(9/36), respectively, whereas that in betel chewers with smoking/drinking it was 47.2%(17/36) and in smokers or drinkers without chewing was 42.0% (21/50). However, the differences were not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis also revealed with the no independent association of betel chewing with p53 expression (odds ratio [OR] 1.81, 95% confidence interval 0.50-6.49), whereas alcohol drinking and smokeless tobacco use were significant (OR 7.58, 2.01-28.53 and 0.39, 0.16-0.98, respectively). These results suggested that betel chewing with or without smokeless tobacco use may not induce oral cancers via a p53-dependent pathway. However, since this is an immunohistochemical study, further molecular analysis is needed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Hat-Yai, 90110, Songkhla, Thailand. tparamee@ratree.psu.ac.th"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thongsuksai", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boonyaphiphat", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Oral Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "9709118", "ISSNLinking": "1368-8375"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chi-Square Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Confidence Intervals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odds Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco, Smokeless"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11287282", "10.1016/s1368-8375(00)00127-5", "S1368-8375(00)00127-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
