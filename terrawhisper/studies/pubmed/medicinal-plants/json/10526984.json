In addition, the activity and isozyme pattern of peroxidase enzymes were also examined. HCHO, as dimedone adduct, and fully N-methylated compounds were determined by overpressured layer chromatography in different development stages of snap bean plant. Peroxidase activities were measured by spectrophotometry and isozyme patterns were examined by isoelectric focusing. HCHO level decreased until blooming with aging of the plant being the highest in the youngest leaves all the time, but then increased again in old leaf tissues. At the same time the concentration of choline and trigonelline as potential HCHO generators (marker molecules or gene products) decreased considerably while peroxidase activity increased with aging of plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, University of Horticulture and Food Industry, Budapest, Hungary."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00e1rdi", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stefanovits-B\u00e1nyai", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Hungary", "MedlineTA": "Acta Biol Hung", "NlmUniqueID": "8404358", "ISSNLinking": "0236-5383"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3NQ9N60I00", "NameOfSubstance": "trigonelline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N91BDP6H0X", "NameOfSubstance": "Choline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Choline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isoelectric Focusing"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10526984"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
