By this system enabled the real time determination of hyphal growth rate could be done in the presence or absence of Chinese herbal extracts. Of the 41 herbal extracts with 60% acetone extracts tested by the present method, 26 were found to contain active components against A. niger hyphal growth. In contrast, by conventional methods, no active component was detected from every herbal extract except 3 herbal extracts. From the extract of Anemarrhena asphodeloides, one of active components was isolated and its structure determined by NMR, UV, and mass spectroscopy. The compound was identified as broussonin A (2-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propyl)-5-methoxy-phenol) which was formerly reported as a phytoalexin of Broussonetia papyrifera Vent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Technology, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iida", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yonemura", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "K B", "Initials": "KB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saito", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsuoka", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1364PS73AF", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus niger"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10630102", "10.1248/yakushi1947.119.12_964"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
