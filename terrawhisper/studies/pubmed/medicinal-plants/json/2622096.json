By two hours after intraperitoneal injection of 500 mg/kg of APS or RHPS, there was an obvious increase in the deposition of C3 on peritoneal macrophages. When APS or RHPS was injected 5 times (1 time/day), the proportion of C3 positive macrophages was more than that of 1-time injection. At the same time, the number of peritoneal macrophages also increased. Since C3 cleavage product occurred with the activation of C3, the results suggest that the immuno-potentiating action of APS and RHPS may be related to the activity of mouse complement C3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ito", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shimura", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Jpn J Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "2983305R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-5198"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "80295-44-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Complement C3c"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Complement C3c"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2622096", "10.1254/jjp.51.432"]}}]}
