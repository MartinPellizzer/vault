This study was conducted to investigate the effects of <i>Aloe vera</i> on performance, serum biochemical parameters and liver histopathology in laying hens fed on aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-contaminated diet. Seventy-two White Leghorns (Hy-Line W-36) were randomly allocated to four treatments. 1) basal diet (control), 2) control plus 1.00 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> AFB1, 3) control diet plus 1.00 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> AFB1 + 100 ppm <i>Aloe vera</i> powder, and 4) control diet plus 1.00 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> AFB1 + 300 ppm <i>Aloe vera</i> powder. Each treatment consisted of three replicates of 6 birds. Egg weight and Haugh units were not affected by AFB1. Egg production and eggshell thickness were lower for groups fed 1.00 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> AFB1. Egg production, egg weight and eggshell thickness were improved by incorporation of <i>Aleo vera</i> in the AFB1 contaminated feed but were not significant. Chickens fed AFB1 had significantly lower aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and uric acid and higher cholesterol than other groups. <i>Aloe vera</i> powder improved levels of cholesterol, uric acid, AST, and ALT. AFB1 also caused histopathological changes in liver tissues, such as vacuolar degeneration, fatty infiltration, and necrosis. The addition of <i>Aloe vera</i> powder to the aflatoxin containing diet reduced the severity of lesions in liver. The data demonstrated the ability of <i>Aloe vera</i> to reduce the adverse effects of AFB1 exposure in laying hens."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Urmia University.
