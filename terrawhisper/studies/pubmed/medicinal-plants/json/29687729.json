Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) have the ability to undergo cardiomyogenesis. Medicinal plants are effective and safe candidates for cell differentiation. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate cardiogenic effects of characterized (HPLC-UV) extracts of Geum urbanum on ADMSCs of adipose tissue. The methanolic extracts of the root and aerial parts of G. urbanum were obtained and MTT assay was used for studying their cytotoxic effects. Then, cells were treated with 50 or 100 \u03bcg/mL of the extracts from root and aerial parts of G. urbanum. MTT assay showed that the extracts of G. urbanum did not have any toxic effects on ADMSCs. Immunostaining results showed increase in the expression of \u03b1-actinin and cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR data confirmed the upregulation of ACTN, ACTC1, and TNNI3 genes in ADMSCs after treatment. According to HPLC fingerprinting, some cardiogenic effects of G. urbanum extracts are probably due to ellagic and gallic acid derivatives. Our findings indicated that G. urbanum extracts effectively upregulated some essential cardiogenic markers, which confirmed the therapeutic role of this plant as a traditional cardiac medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Biotechnology Research Center, Institute of Pharmaceutical Technology, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Neshati", "ForeName": "Vajiheh", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Biotechnology Research Center, Institute of Pharmaceutical Technology, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Biotechnology Research Center, Institute of Pharmaceutical Technology, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fazly Bazzaz", "ForeName": "Bibi Sedigheh", "Initials": "BS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Biotechnology Research Center, Institute of Pharmaceutical Technology, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Iranshahi", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Medical Genetics Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mojarrad", "ForeName": "Majid", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Research Group, Academic Center for Education, Culture, Research (ACECR), Khorasan Razavi Branch, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Naderi-Meshkin", "ForeName": "Hojjat", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Medical Genetics Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kerachian", "ForeName": "Mohammad Amin", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Cell Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8606068", "ISSNLinking": "0829-8211"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, Differentiation"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adipose Tissue"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Geum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mesenchymal Stem Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Myocytes, Cardiac"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29687729", "10.1139/bcb-2017-0313"]}}]}
