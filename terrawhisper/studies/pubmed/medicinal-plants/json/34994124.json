China and Thailand are amicable neighbors, and the cooperation between the two countries in the field of traditional medicine has become increasingly close in recent years. Nevertheless, on account of the differences in culture, region, politics, economy and so on, the two countries have common features and unique characteristics in the theoretical system of traditional medicine, quality standard control of medicinal materials, research and development and use of medicinal materials. This paper summarizes the similarities and differences as well as the development opportunities of traditional medicine between China and Thailand. The specific content involves the development history, resources, and use of medicinal resources in Thailand, the main achievements and existing problems of modern research of Thai medicine, the spread and development of Chinese medicine in Thailand, and the spread and development of Thai medicine in China. Furthermore, the paper outlines the recent situation of traditional medicine interflow and cooperation between the two countries, and predicts the prospects for cooperation and development of traditional medicine between China and Thailand in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative, especially in the joint research and development and the improvement of quality standards of important medicinal plant varieties commonly used by the two countries and circulated across the border. Through the exchange and mutual learning, we can step up the traditional medicine cooperation between China and Thailand, which will provide advantageous conditions for the safety of medicine use as well as political and social stability between the two countries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Jin-Biao", "Initials": "JB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Laboratory, the First Affiliated Hospital, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "Pu", "ForeName": "Xue-Mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Xu-Dong", "Initials": "XD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "Dou", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "59"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34994124", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210830.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
