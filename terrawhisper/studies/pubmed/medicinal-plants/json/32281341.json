It is a common Chinese herbal medicine in China and has a large market demand. When exposing to strong light intensity and high temperature during the growth process, P. ternata withers in a phenomenon known as &quot;sprout tumble&quot;, which largely limits tuber production. Shade can effectively delay sprout tumble formation and increase its yield, however the relevant regulation mechanism is unclear. DNA methylation, as a self-modifying response to environmental changes, is often involved in the regulation of plant growth and development. In this study, P. ternata grown under natural light and 90% shading were selected as the control group and the experimental group for genomic DNA methylation analysis by using methylate sensitive amplification polymorphism(MSAP). The results showed that a total of 617 loci were detected with 20 pairs of primers, of which 311 were in the natural light group and 306 in the shading group. The methylation sites in the light and shading groups accounted for 58.2% and 71.57%, respectively, and the methylation ratios in the methylation sites were 27.65% and 29.41%, respectively, indicating that shading significantly induced the genome DNA methylation of P. ternata. Compared to the natural light group, shading promoted 32.51% of the genes methylation, while inducing 16.25% gene demethylation. This study reveals the DNA methylation variation of P. ternata under shading conditions, which lays a preliminary theoretical foundation for further analysis of the mechanism of shading regulation of P. ternata growth from epigenetic level."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resource Plant Biology of Anhui Province, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Pollutant Sensitive Materials and Environmental Remediation, College of Life Sciences, Huaibei Normal University Huaibei 235000, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Jiang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resource Plant Biology of Anhui Province, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Pollutant Sensitive Materials and Environmental Remediation, College of Life Sciences, Huaibei Normal University Huaibei 235000, China."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Yu-Jie", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resource Plant Biology of Anhui Province, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Pollutant Sensitive Materials and Environmental Remediation, College of Life Sciences, Huaibei Normal University Huaibei 235000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Han", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resource Plant Biology of Anhui Province, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Pollutant Sensitive Materials and Environmental Remediation, College of Life Sciences, Huaibei Normal University Huaibei 235000, China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Xue", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resource Plant Biology of Anhui Province, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Pollutant Sensitive Materials and Environmental Remediation, College of Life Sciences, Huaibei Normal University Huaibei 235000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ze-Yu", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resource Plant Biology of Anhui Province, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Pollutant Sensitive Materials and Environmental Remediation, College of Life Sciences, Huaibei Normal University Huaibei 235000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Miao-Miao", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resource Plant Biology of Anhui Province, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Pollutant Sensitive Materials and Environmental Remediation, College of Life Sciences, Huaibei Normal University Huaibei 235000, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jiang-Shan", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resource Plant Biology of Anhui Province, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Pollutant Sensitive Materials and Environmental Remediation, College of Life Sciences, Huaibei Normal University Huaibei 235000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yan-Fang", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resource Plant Biology of Anhui Province, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Pollutant Sensitive Materials and Environmental Remediation, College of Life Sciences, Huaibei Normal University Huaibei 235000, China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resource Plant Biology of Anhui Province, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Pollutant Sensitive Materials and Environmental Remediation, College of Life Sciences, Huaibei Normal University Huaibei 235000, China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Jian-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Methylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Darkness"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epigenesis, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pinellia"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32281341", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200105.105"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
