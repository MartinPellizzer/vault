It has the effect of nourishing the stomach, nourishing yin and clearing heat. In China, there are many types of Dendrobium, and different Dendrobium species have different efficacy. The present study is aimed at distinguishing three major Dendrobium species from morphological and microscopic identification in Ta-pieh mountains area. In this article, the roots, stems and leaves of Dendrobium huoshanense, Dendrobium officinale, and Dendrobium moniliforme are used as materials to compare the differences of tissues of these three Dendrobium species by morphological indexes and microscopic identification of different Dendrobium. The stem morphology of these three Dendrobium species was significantly different except for stem internodes number and the middle part of the stem diameter by measuring the stems of Dendrobium. To ensure the safe use of Dendrobium, we built a fast and convenient method combining normal and fluorescence microscopy was applied in the present study to distinguish D. huoshanense, D. officinale, and D. moniliforme. The microscopic results show that different types of Dendrobium exhibit different states that can be distinguished under normal light normal and fluorescence microscopy. This comparative study of morphology and microscopy contributes to the development of identification and quality evaluation of Dendrobium."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Co-Innovation Center for Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Soil and Water Conservation and Ecological Restoration, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Yingdan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Co-Innovation Center for Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Soil and Water Conservation and Ecological Restoration, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Co-Innovation Center for Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Soil and Water Conservation and Ecological Restoration, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jinping", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0517-7214"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Co-Innovation Center for Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Soil and Water Conservation and Ecological Restoration, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jinchi", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ZYYS-2014 [12]", "Agency": "National traditional Chinese medicine standardization project", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "CX (17)1004", "Agency": "Jiangsu Agriculture Science and Technology Innovation Fund", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "201504406", "Agency": "National Special Fund for Forestry Scientific Research in the Public Interest", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Microsc Res Tech", "NlmUniqueID": "9203012", "ISSNLinking": "1059-910X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "classification", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "classification", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30636024", "10.1002/jemt.23191"]}}]}
