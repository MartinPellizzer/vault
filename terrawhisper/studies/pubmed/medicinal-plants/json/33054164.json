We have recently exhibited belladonna may be widely applicable for the treatment of various neurological disorders. Therefore, we developed a hydroalcoholic formulation of belladonna (B200) consisting of atropine and scopolamine and showed its antiviral efficacy against JEV infection. B200 treatment increases neuronal cell survival by reducing JEV induced cytopathic effects which were evident from significant reduction in necrotic cell population by flow-cytometry analysis and caspase 3 and 8 enzymatic activities. B200 treatment was found to reduce the intracellular JEV level observed by significant reduction in JEV-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) expression in both neurons and microglia. Because microglia plays a crucial role in JEV pathogenesis, we further investigated the anti-JEV effects of B200 on human microglia cells and elucidated the mechanism of action by performing whole-transcriptome sequencing. Gene expression analysis revealed that B200 reduces the pro-apoptotic and inflammatory gene expression observed by significant reduction in <i>BAD</i>, <i>BAX</i>, <i>CASP3</i>, <i>CASP8</i>, <i>IL1B</i>, and <i>CXCL10</i> and increase in IL10 responsive gene expression. Interestingly, our molecular docking analysis revealed that atropine and scopolamine interact with the His288 residue of NS3 protein, a crucial residue for RNA unwinding and ATPase activity that was further confirmed by degradation of NS3 protein. Drug likeness, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion), and toxicity analysis further suggests that atropine and scopolamine both cross the blood-brain barrier, which is crucial for effective treatment of Japanese encephalitis (JE)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Advanced Research (CFAR), Faculty of Medicine, King George's Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow 226003, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Swatantra", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Advanced Research (CFAR), Faculty of Medicine, King George's Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow 226003, India."}], "LastName": "Maurya", "ForeName": "Vimal K", "Initials": "VK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Allied Health, Faculty of Health, Education, Medicine, and Social Care, Anglia Ruskin University, Chelmsford CM1 1SQ, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Kabir", "ForeName": "Russell", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CCRH, Ministry of Ayush, Janakpuri, New Delhi 110058, India."}], "LastName": "Nayak", "ForeName": "Debadatta", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CCRH, Ministry of Ayush, Janakpuri, New Delhi 110058, India."}], "LastName": "Khurana", "ForeName": "Anil", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CCRH, Ministry of Ayush, Janakpuri, New Delhi 110058, India."}], "LastName": "Manchanda", "ForeName": "Raj K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, JSPS Government Medical College, Hyderabad 500013, India."}], "LastName": "Gadugu", "ForeName": "Srinivasulu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Shanker", "ForeName": "Karuna", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2856-4185"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Advanced Research (CFAR), Faculty of Medicine, King George's Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow 226003, India."}], "LastName": "Saxena", "ForeName": "Shailendra K", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Chem Neurosci", "NlmUniqueID": "101525337", "ISSNLinking": "1948-7193"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atropa belladonna"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Encephalitis Virus, Japanese"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Encephalitis, Japanese"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microglia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neurons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "4"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33054164", "10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00603"]}}]}
