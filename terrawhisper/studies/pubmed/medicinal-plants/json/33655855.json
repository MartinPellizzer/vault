The antioxidant capacity was assessed using DPPH, ABTS, \u03b2-carotene/linoleic acid, CUPRAC and FRAP assays, and in vitro cholinesterase activity against acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase were evaluated. The chemical constituents of the extracts were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric detection and gas chromatography. For the acute toxicity study, extracts were administered to mice at single dose of 2 g/kg and 5 g/kg by gavage.", "Plant extracts were rich in phenolic compounds. Ethyl acetate extract presented the highest phenolic (238.44 \u00b1 1.50 \u03bcg GAE /mg of extract) and flavonoid (21.12 \u00b1 0.00 \u03bcg QE /mg of extract) contents. Likewise, ethyl acetate extract showed potent radical scavenging and reducing properties. Ethanol-acetone extract showed inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase, and was a potent inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase. In all extracts, flavonoids were the most abundant compounds. The phytochemical investigation showed the presence of alkaloids (ephedrine and pseudo-ephedrine). In the acute toxicity, the LD<sub>50</sub> was superior to 5 g/kg body weight. There were no alterations in the histology of the liver and kidneys.", "This study demonstrated a good antioxidant potential and anticholinesterase activity of aerial parts of E. nebrodensis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Phytotherapy Applied to Chronic Diseases, Faculty of Natural and Life Sciences, University Ferhat Abbas Setif 1, Setif 19000, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Hamoudi", "ForeName": "Meriem", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Phytotherapy Applied to Chronic Diseases, Faculty of Natural and Life Sciences, University Ferhat Abbas Setif 1, Setif 19000, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Amroun", "ForeName": "Djouher", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of pharmacognosy UMR CNRS 8038 CiTCOM, Faculty of Health, UFR Pharmacy, 4 Avenue de l\\'Observatoire, 75270 Paris Cedex 06, France."}], "LastName": "Boutefnouchet", "ForeName": "Sabrina", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre de Recherche en Biotechnologie, Ali Mendjli Nouvelle Ville UV03, Constantine, Alg\u00e9rie."}], "LastName": "Bensouici", "ForeName": "Chawki", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Phytotherapy Applied to Chronic Diseases, Faculty of Natural and Life Sciences, University Ferhat Abbas Setif 1, Setif 19000, Algeria."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire d'Anatomie Pathologique, Centre Hospitalo- Universitaire (CHU) S\u00e9tif, Alg\u00e9rie."}], "LastName": "Kaoula", "ForeName": "Samira", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Applied Microbiology, Faculty of Natural and Life Sciences, University Ferhat Abbas Setif1, Setif 19000, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Harzallah", "ForeName": "Daoud", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Phytotherapy Applied to Chronic Diseases, Faculty of Natural and Life Sciences, University Ferhat Abbas Setif 1, Setif 19000, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Khennouf", "ForeName": "Seddik", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Phytotherapy Applied to Chronic Diseases, Faculty of Natural and Life Sciences, University Ferhat Abbas Setif 1, Setif 19000, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Dahamna", "ForeName": "Saliha", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Comb Chem High Throughput Screen", "NlmUniqueID": "9810948", "ISSNLinking": "1386-2073"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.8", "NameOfSubstance": "Butyrylcholinesterase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GN83C131XS", "NameOfSubstance": "Ephedrine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Butyrylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ephedra"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ephedrine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33655855", "10.2174/1386207324666210303094339", "CCHTS-EPUB-114687"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
