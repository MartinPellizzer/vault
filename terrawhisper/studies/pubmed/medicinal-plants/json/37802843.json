The chemical structures of all isolated compounds were identified on the basis of their physicochemical properties, spectroscopic analyses, and the comparison of their physicochemical and spectroscopic data with the reported data in literature. As a result, 21 compounds were isolated from the 90% ethanol extract of the stems and leaves of C. cochinchinense, which were identified as cratocochine(1), 1-hydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyxanthone(2), 1-hydroxy-5,6,7-trimethoxyxanthone(3), ferrxanthone(4), 3,6-dihydroxy-1,5-dimethoxyxanthone(5), 3,6-dihydroxy-1,7-dimethoxyxanthone(6), 1,2,5-trihydroxy-6,8-dimethoxyxanthone(7), securixanthone G(8), gentisein(9), 3,7-dihydroxy-1-methoxyxanthone(10), pancixanthone B(11), garcimangosxanthone A(12), pruniflorone L(13), 9-hydroxy alabaxanthone(14), cochinchinone A(15), luteolin(16), 3,5'-dimethoxy-4',7-epoxy-8,3'-neolignane-5,9,9'-triol(17), N-benzyl-9-oxo-10E,12E-octadecadienamide(18), 15-hydroxy-7,13E-labdadiene(19), stigmasta-4,22-dien-3-one(20), and stigmast-5-en-3\u03b2-ol(21). Among these isolates, compound 1 was a new xanthone, compounds 2-5, 7, 8, 12, and 16-21 were isolated from the Cratoxylum plant for the first time, and compounds 11 and 13 were obtained from C. cochinchinense for the first time. Furthermore, all isolated compounds 1-21 were appraised for their anti-rheumatoid arthritis activities by MTS method through measuring their anti-proliferative effect on synoviocytes in vitro. As a result, xanthones 1-15 displayed notable anti-rheumatoid arthritis activities, which showed inhibitory effects on the proliferation of MH7A synoviocytes with the IC_(50) values ranging from(8.98\u00b10.12) to(228.68\u00b10.32) \u03bcmol\u00b7L~(-1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Ni-Fei", "Initials": "NF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Zhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yi-Meng", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Cai-Huan", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Ya-Yuan", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ran", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China Key Laboratory of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Haikou City,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yan-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China Key Laboratory of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Haikou City,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Yan-Hui", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Synoviocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Clusiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37802843", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20230609.201"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
