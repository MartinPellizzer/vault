In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the role of HY5 is very well-defined in regulating primary root growth and lateral root formation; however, information regarding its role in root hair development is still lacking, and little is known about the genetic pathways regulating this process. In this study, we investigated the role of HY5 and its associated components in root hair development. Detailed analysis of root hair phenotype in wild-type (WT) and light signaling mutants in light and dark conditions revealed the importance of light-dependent HY5-mediated root hair initiation. Altered auxin levels in the root apex of the hy5 mutant and interaction of HY5 with promoters of root hair developmental genes were responsible for differential expression of root hair developmental genes and phenotype in the hy5 mutant. The partial complementation of root hair in the hy5 mutant after external supplementation of auxin and regaining of root hair in PIN-FORMED 2 (pin2) and PIN-FORMED 2 (pin3) mutants after grafting suggested that the auxin-mediated root hair development pathway requires HY5. Furthermore, miR397b overexpression (miR397bOX) and CRISPR/Cas9-based mutants (miR397bCR) indicated miR397b targets genes encoding Reduced Residual Arabinose (RRA1/RRA2), which in turn regulate root hair growth. The regulation of the miR397b- (RRA1/RRA2) module by HY5 demonstrated its indirect role by targeting root hair cell wall genes. Together, this study demonstrated that HY5 controls root hair development by integrating auxin signalling and other miRNA-mediated pathways."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
