Traditionally, Debo has been employed for the purpose of preventing responses to trauma, ischemia, and other diseases in the nervous system. C6 glial cells were exposed to oxidative stress through the imployment of ZnCl2, and generates H2O2 and hydroxyl radicals by fenton reaction. ZnCl2-induced death of C6 glial cells, which was revealed as apoptosis by chromatin condensation as well as DNA fragmentation. Pretreatment of Debo significantly prevented apoptotic death of C6 glial cells via inhibition of H2O, generation as well as the recovering of an antioxidant, reduced glutathione (GSH). Also, deprivation of serum and glucose, found in ischemia, deceased the viability of PC12 cells up to 60% via generation of H2O2. However, Debo significantly protected cells from ischemic damage through decrease in H2O, generation. Furthermore, Debo markedly inhibited the transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB by ZnCI, in C6 glial cells. These results suggest that Debo may function as an antioxidant system against free radicals and be applicable to protect brain cells against oxidative or ischemic stresses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Professional Graduate School of Oriental Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Chonbuk, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "So", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moon", "ForeName": "B S", "Initials": "BS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8800150", "ISSNLinking": "0892-3973"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J41CSQ7QDS", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Fragmentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroglia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "PC12 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Zinc"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11694029", "10.1081/iph-100107338"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
