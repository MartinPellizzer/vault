Its biological effects on melanin synthesis of caraway have been investigated. However, beyond psoralen and isopsoralen alone, no further chemical component of caraway has been revealed. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry was employed to comprehensively characterize the chemical components present in caraway. Based on accurate mass measurements, key fragmental ions and comparison with reference standards, 75 chemical components were identified in caraway. Moreover, a tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for quantitative analysis of three pairs isomeric components, namely psoralen/isopsoralen, bavachin/isobavachalcone and bavachromene/isobavachromene in rat plasma. Psoralen, isopsoralen, bavachin, and isobavachalcone showed linearity with concentration ranging of 1.0-500.0\u00a0ng/ml. The linear ranges for bavachromene and isobavachromene were 0.2-500.0\u00a0ng/ml. The accuracies were in ranges of 85%-115% with coefficient of variation errors of less than 15%. Furthermore, the method was applied to quantify the three pairs isomeric components in rats after oral administration of caraway."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, CAS Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, P.R.China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, No.19(A) Yuquan Road, Shijingshan District, Beijing, P.R.China."}], "LastName": "Wahefu", "ForeName": "Atikanmu", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, CAS Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, P.R.China."}], "LastName": "Abdulla", "ForeName": "Rahima", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, CAS Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, P.R.China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Xueying", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, CAS Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, P.R.China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yongqiang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4652-6879"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, CAS Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, P.R.China."}], "LastName": "Aisa", "ForeName": "Haji Akber", "Initials": "HA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CASIMM0620183001", "Agency": "Institutes for Drug Discovery and Development, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2009211B34", "Agency": "Xinjiang Natural Science Foundation", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Sep Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101088554", "ISSNLinking": "1615-9306"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Furocoumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KTZ7ZCN2EX", "NameOfSubstance": "Ficusin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ficusin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Furocoumarins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prescriptions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Yang L, Yu Y, Cheng L, Zhang P, Zhang Y, Zhou K.
