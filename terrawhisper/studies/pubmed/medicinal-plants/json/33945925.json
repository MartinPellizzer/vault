Analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that they form a separate cluster related to the genus Roseomonas. A comparative whole genome analysis of the two strains and the type strains of related Roseomonas species revealed average nucleotide identity values from 78.84 and 80.32%. The G\u202f+\u202fC contents of the genomic DNA of strains LMG 31523<sup>T</sup> and LMG 31524 were 69.69% and 69.74%, respectively. Combined data from phenotypic, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic studies indicated that the strains LMG 31523<sup>T</sup> and LMG 31524 represent a novel species of the genus Roseomonas. Genome analysis of the new strains showed a number of genes involved in survival in the rhizosphere environment and in plant colonization and confirmed the endophytic characteristics of LMG 31523<sup>T</sup> and LMG 31524. Since the strains LMG 31523<sup>T</sup> and LMG 31524 were isolated from a plant collected in Greece the name Roseomonas hellenica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is LMG 31523<sup>T</sup> (=CECT 30032<sup>T</sup>)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH..
