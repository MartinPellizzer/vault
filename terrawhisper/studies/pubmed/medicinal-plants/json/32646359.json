Medicinal plants continue to be a solid niche for biologically active and therapeutically effective chemical entities, opening up new avenues for the successful treatment of several human diseases. The contribution of plant-derived compounds to drug discovery, either in their original or in the semi-synthetic derivative form, extends far back in time. This review aims to focus on the sources, biological, and pharmacological profile of a pharmacologically active plant-derived coumarin, osthole, which is an important component of numerous remedial plants such as Cnidium monnieri. Several studies have revealed that osthole possess pharmacological properties such as anticancer, antioxidant, anti-hyperglycemic, neuroprotective, and antiplatelet. Osthole has been reported to regulate various signaling pathways, which in turn modulate several apoptosis-related proteins, cell cycle regulators, protein kinases, transcriptional factors, cytokines, and growth receptors affiliated with inflammation, proliferation and several other ailments. Osthole is known to halt proliferation and metastasis of cancerous cells by arresting the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. The data in this review paper supports the pharmacological potential of osthole but further experimentation, biosafety profiling and synergistic effects of this compound need to be focused by the researchers to understand the full spectrum of pharmacological potential of this therapeutically potent compound."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers;
