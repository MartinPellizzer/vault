Intraperitoneal administration of the extract with CTX significantly increased the total WBC count (3,356 +/- 236 cells/cm2), bone marrow cellularity (15.6 +/- 0.42 cells/femur) and alpha-esterase positive cells (846 +/- 30 cells) when compared to control mice treated with CTX alone. The relative organ weight of the spleen and thymus was also found to be increased after B. sensitivum administration when compared to the control mice. Reduction of GSH in liver (4.9 +/- 0.22 nmol/mg protein) and in intestinal mucosa (10.6 +/- 1.02 nmol/mg protein) of CTX treated controls was significantly reversed by B. sensitivum administration (liver: 6.5 +/- 0.18 nmol/mg protein; intestinal mucosa: 16.5 +/- 0.88 nmol/mg protein), with amelioration of changes in serum and liver ALP, GPT and lipid peroxidation. Histopathological analysis of the small intestine also suggests that B. sensitivum could reduce CTX induced intestinal damage. The level of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-alpha, which was elevated during CTX administration, was significantly reduced by the administration of B. sensitivum extract. The lowered levels of cytokines IFN-gamma, IL-2 and GM-CSF after CTX treatment were also found to be increased by B. sensitivum extract administration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amala Cancer Research Centre, Amala Nagar, Thrissur-680555, Kerala State, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guruvayoorappan", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuttan", "ForeName": "Girija", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Drug Metabol Drug Interact", "NlmUniqueID": "8904736", "ISSNLinking": "0792-5077"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8N3DW7272P", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclophosphamide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclophosphamide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17708064", "10.1515/dmdi.2007.22.2-3.131"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
