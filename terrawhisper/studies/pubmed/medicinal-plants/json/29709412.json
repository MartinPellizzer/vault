(Rutaceae), commonly known as \"bael\" in Nepal and India, is a valuable medicinal plant and is considered sacred by the Hindus. It is used to cure several diseases in the Indian traditional medicine system of Ayurveda and has had similar uses among many ethnic communities residing in Indian subcontinent for over 5000\u202fyears. Its leaves, bark, stem, fruits and seeds have been used for various medicinal purposes. Bael fruits are especially effective in the treatment of chronic diarrhea, dysentery and peptic ulcers, while they are also useful as a laxative and cure for respiratory infections. Scientific studies have validated many of the ethnomedicinal uses of A. marmelos, which include antibacterial, antiviral, antidiarrheal, gastroprotective, anti-ulcerative colitis, hepatoprotective, antidiabetic, cardioprotective and radioprotective effects. Recently, this plant has also received attention as an anticancer agent for the treatment of various types of cancers. Thus, this review focuses on scientific evidence verifying the important pharmacological activity such as antioxidant, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective and anticancer activity of A. marmelos."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
