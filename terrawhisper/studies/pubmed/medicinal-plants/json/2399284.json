RbcS transcription was measured by hybridising labelled transcripts of isolated nuclei to rbcS cDNA clones. Transfer of green Pisum leaf tissue to darkness for 5 h causes a substantial decrease in the rate of rbcS transcription and the rate is restored rapidly when the plants are returned to white light. Low fluence rates of red light are ineffective in restoring the rate of rbcS transcription, suggesting that phytochrome alone does not fully mediate the response. Blue light is similarly effective to white light of an equal fluence rate (120 mumol m-2 s-1) in restoring the rate of rbcS transcription in the dark-treated plants, indicating that a blue light photoreceptor is involved. However, red light at the same fluence rate produces about 65% of the effect of blue or white light, showing that the blue light photoreceptor is not the only photoreceptor controlling rbcS transcription in the green leaf tissue. The identity of the photoreceptor responsible for the red light effect is discussed. Similar effects of blue and red light are observed at the level of transcript abundance in dark-grown pea leaf tissue given a brief illumination with red light, which potentiates the tissue for rapid transcript accumulation in white light."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Glasgow, Scotland, UK."}], "LastName": "Clugston", "ForeName": "C K", "Initials": "CK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Barnett", "ForeName": "L K", "Initials": "LK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Urwin", "ForeName": "N A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jenkins", "ForeName": "G I", "Initials": "GI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Darkness"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2399284", "10.1111/j.1751-1097.1990.tb01750.x"]}}]}
