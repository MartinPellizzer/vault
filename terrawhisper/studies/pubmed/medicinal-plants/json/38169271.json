Many EGFR inhibitors were successfully developed as ani-tumor drugs to treat NSCLC patients. Unfortunately, drug resistances were found in clinic. To overcome C797S mutation in EGFR, a novel series of 4-arylamine substituted pyrimidine derivatives were designed and synthesized under the principle of structure-based drug design. Interestingly, compounds 6e and 9i demonstrated the best anti-proliferative activity against A549, NCI-H1975, and HCC827\u00a0cells. In particular, the IC<sub>50</sub> values against HCC827\u00a0cells reached to 24.6\u00a0nM and 31.6\u00a0nM, which were much lower than human normal cells 2BS and LO2. Furthermore, compounds 6e and 9i showed extraordinary activity against EGFR<sup>19del/T790M/C797S</sup> (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a016.06\u00a0nM and 37.95\u00a0nM) and EGFR<sup>L858R/T790M/C797S</sup> (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a011.81\u00a0nM and 26.68\u00a0nM), which were potent than Osimertinib (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a052.28\u00a0nM and 157.60\u00a0nM). Further studies have shown that compounds 6e and 9i could pertain inhibition of HCC827 colony formation, and arrest HCC827\u00a0cells at G2/M phase. Moreover, the most promising compound 6e could inhibit the migration of HCC827\u00a0cells, induce HCC827\u00a0cells apoptosis, and significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT and Erk<sub>1/2</sub>. In vivo xenograft mouse model with HCC827\u00a0cells, compound 6e resulted in remarkable tumor regression without obvious toxicity. In addition, molecular docking studies suggested that compound 6e could firmly combine with T790M-mutant, T790\u00a0M/C797S-mutant, and L858R/T790\u00a0M/C797S-mutant EGFR kinases as ATP-competitive inhibitor."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
