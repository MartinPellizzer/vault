The reported C-glycosyl quinochalcones have the same quinochalcone skeleton with a hydroxyl group at the 5'-position and a glucose linked to this position with a carbon-carbon bond. In this study, the standard hydroxysafflor yellow A and water-extracted fraction of Carthamus tinctorius L. were analyzed by ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOFMS) in both positive and negative ion modes. The fragmentation pathways of C-glycosyl quinochalcones were interpreted and validated by accurate mass measurement. Their fragmentation showed a special cleavage at the C-C bond except for the typical internal cleavage at the sugar moiety of other C-glycosyl flavonoids. In positive ion mode, cleavage of the 5'-glucose produced an [M+H-162](+) ion by a neutral loss, while cleavage of the 5'-glucose in negative ion mode led to an [M-H-163](-.) ion by radical cleavage. The cleavage from the carbonyl group produced fragment ions containing an A or a B ring. The fragment ions containing an A ring were common product ions of seven compounds in both ion modes, and fragment ions containing the B ring were used to judge the different substituent groups at the 3'-position. The fragmentation patterns of seven structurally related C-glycosyl quinochalcones were analyzed systematically and the formation of the fragment ions in two modes is explained in detail in this report. UPLC/Q-TOFMS is an effective tool for characterizing a complex sample, which gives higher resolution separation and generates accurate mass measurement of the product ions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiu-li", "Initials": "XL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Yuan-sheng", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ke", "ForeName": "Yan-xiong", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Xing-ya", "Initials": "XY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Fei-fang", "Initials": "FF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Xin-miao", "Initials": "XM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Validation Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "8802365", "ISSNLinking": "0951-4198"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "safflomin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "146087-19-6", "NameOfSubstance": "hydroxysafflor yellow A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5S5A2Q39HX", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P9ZT730WWS", "NameOfSubstance": "carthamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carthamus tinctorius"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chalcone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Quinones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18383217", "10.1002/rcm.3468"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
