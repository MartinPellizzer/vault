The polymorphic bands of RAPD were counted. And the results were analyzed by clustering analysis NTSYS-PC software.", "A total of 125 loci were detected by 14 arbitrary primers, among which 109 and 106 loci were polymorphic in C. pilosula and C. pilosula var. modesta respectively, and the percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) were 87.20% and 84. 80%. The cluster analysis showed that 13 populations were divided into 2 groups. The one included 8 cultivated populations of C. pilosula, the other group consisted of a cultivated population and 4 nature populations of C. pilosula var. modesta.", "The RAPD results indicated that there was abundant genetic diversity in cultivated populations of C. pilosula and C. pilosula var. modesta. The genetic differentiation among 8 cultivated populations of C. pilosula was very small and related to their geographical distance. Only the cultivation in Wen County originated from C. pilosula var. modesta, while the other populations cultivated in Gansu Province belongs to C. pilosula."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jian-qing", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Xue", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Qiong", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Song-shuang", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cluster Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Codonopsis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16981447"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
