They may vary among genera, species or within a genus and mainly include latex, sap, gums, resins, seed or root exudates. Plant exudates are known to possess several biological activities including, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, wound healing and anti-nociceptive. Exudates oozed out from plants have also been used as ingredients in medicines, food, perfumes and cosmetics. The present review provides brief overview about the exudates released from plants, their biological properties and beneficial effects for human beings. Due to the presence of various compounds, different methodologies and procedures have been employed for their collection and analyses. Literature studies suggest that plant exudates have extensive therapeutic potential for curing diseases with minimal toxic effects. This aspect could be taken into account in prospective studies regarding the search of new products derived from plant exudates with pharmaceutical value."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
