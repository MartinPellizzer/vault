It is also present in plants and regulates the photochemical reaction in Photosystem II, the stress response and root growth. To investigate the mechanism by which ZEN regulates Tetrastigma hemsleyanum root growth, differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified and verified by high-throughput sequencing and Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation of the roots of T. hemsleyanum seedlings treated with and without ZEN. The predicted functions of microRNA156b (miR156b) and microRNA156f (miR156f) were confirmed in transgenic hairy roots. (i) A total of 70 miRNAs showed significantly different expression levels under ZEN treatment, including seven highly conserved miRNAs. (ii) The number of lateral roots and total root length of the transgenic hairy roots overexpressing miR156b and miR156f was significantly higher than the wild-type hairy roots, and thus the overexpression of miR156b and miR156f in T. hemsleyanum promoted lateral root development. (iii) Bioinformatics analysis predicted that the target genes of miR156b and miR156f were SPL9/10. As compared with the wild-type hairy roots, the expression of SPL9 was significantly lower in the hairy roots overexpressing miR156b, and the expression of SPL10 was significantly lower in the hairy roots overexpressing miR156f. Therefore, SPL9 could be the target gene of miR156b, and SPL10 could be the target gene of miR156f. This study shows that ZEN could increase the expression of miR156b and miR156f in T. hemsleyanum roots, which negatively regulated the expression of their putative target genes SPL9 and SPL10, consequently promoting the growth and development of the lateral roots."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.
