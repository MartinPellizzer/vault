In tropical countries such as India, periodic chikungunya outbreaks can occur due the high prevalence of the mosquito vector, circulation of virus and the high population density. To curtail the virus in outbreak situation, a ready to use drug for chikungunya is necessary. Using the literature mentioned plant extracts, we used four assays to screen and identify indigenous plants with CHIKV inhibitory activity. Our results showed that the aqueous extract of five plant extracts exhibited anti-CHIKV activity by inhibiting viral attachment, four plant extracts exhibited replication inhibition through inhibition of helicase activity, two plants showed inhibition of protease activity. Two plant extracts showed both viral attachment inhibition and replication inhibition and also exhibited dose dependent response in virus replication inhibition assay. These findings warrant further investigation to standardize these plant extracts as antiviral formulation for chikungunya infection."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
