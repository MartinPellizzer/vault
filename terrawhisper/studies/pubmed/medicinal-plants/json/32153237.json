In the present study, the effect of powder and extract of <i>C. scolymus</i> on broilers has reviewed. This review shows that the impact of <i>C. scolymus</i> on production performance, carcass characteristics, liver enzymes activity, and meat characteristics of broiler chickens are not significant. However, the negative impact of this compound on these properties has not reported. Moreover, cholesterol levels reduced by the dietary <i>C. scolymus</i> supplementation. The impact of <i>C. scolymus</i> powder and extract on chickens' broiler immunity was not significant in the cited literature, but dietary <i>C. scolymus</i> powder increases Newcastle antibody titers and lowers blood pressure. Dietary <i>C. scolymus</i> under heat stress increased anti-sheep red blood cell titers. No substantial studies have conducted on the effect of <i>C. scolymus</i> on broilers. Therefore, it is not possible to determine a single dosage for the use of <i>C. scolymus</i> powder or extract in broiler diets to the improvement of the broiler characteristics. More researches are needed to determining the appropriate dosage to achieve maximum performance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8791-1074"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science, Rasht Branch, Islamic Azad University, Rasht, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zaker-Esteghamati", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1903-2753"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science, Rasht Branch, Islamic Azad University, Rasht, Iran."}], "LastName": "Seidavi", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2622-3777"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science, Rasht Branch, Islamic Azad University, Rasht, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bouyeh", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Anim Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "9011409", "ISSNLinking": "1049-5398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Powders"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cynara scolymus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Powders"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32153237", "10.1080/10495398.2020.1737097"]}}]}
