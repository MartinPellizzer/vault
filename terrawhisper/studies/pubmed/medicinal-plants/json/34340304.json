Our data indicated that the fasting blood glucose levels were reduced by 53.5% after treatment with LRa05 at a dose of 10<sup>9</sup> CFU\u00b7day<sup>-1</sup>. Meanwhile, LRa05 attenuated insulin resistance, relieved hepatic oxidative stress, and alleviated metabolic lipopolysaccharide-related inflammation in T2DM mice. LRa05 promoted the expression of glucose transporter 2, while it inhibited the expression of glucagon receptor, glucose-6-phosphatase, cellular adenosine-3'-5'-cyclic monophosphate-dependent protein kinase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in diabetic mice. Meanwhile, LRa05 reshaped gut microbiota, resulting in increased short-chain fatty acid bacteria (<i>Alloprevotella</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i>) and decreased proinflammatory bacteria (<i>Odoribacter</i> and <i>Mucispirillum</i>). Thus, LRa05 may be used as a functional food supplement for modulating the disorder glucose metabolism and gut microbiota in T2DM."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1158-4008"],
