The addition of OGT (0.5 and 4.2 mg/ml), which had no effect on cell proliferation and cellular protein content, caused a marked decrease in the cellular cholesterol content, particularly cholesteryl ester content following 24 h incubation. The incorporation of 14C-oleate into cellular cholesteryl ester fraction was also reduced remarkably during incubation for 6 and 24 h. The effects of OGT, its components and its main active chemicals on acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity were studied in vitro to explore the mechanism by which OGT inhibits cholesteryl ester formation. The data confirmed that OGT, in a dose-dependent manner, and its components (Scutellaria baicalensis, Coptis japonica, Gardenia jasminoides and Phellodendron amurense) remarkably inhibit ACAT activity. Among the main active chemicals of OGT, baicalein, a kind of flavonoid, decreased ACAT activity in a dose-dependent fashion from the level of 10(-6)M. These results strongly suggest that OGT reduces the cholesteryl ester formation in human hepatocytes by inhibiting ACAT, and that baicalein may, in part, be responsible for ACAT inhibition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Biological Sciences, Saga University, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yotsumoto", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yanagita", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamamoto", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ogawa", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cha", "ForeName": "J Y", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mori", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol Esters"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "oren gedoku to"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.1.26", "NameOfSubstance": "Sterol O-Acyltransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol Esters"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sterol O-Acyltransferase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9140228", "10.1055/s-2006-957631"]}}]}
