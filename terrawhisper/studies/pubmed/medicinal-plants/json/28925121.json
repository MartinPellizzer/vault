Eighteen batch samples of J. mandshurica from six harvest periods were assessed by multivariate statistical analysis with Markerview software. The formula of different compounds were determined by accurate mass and isotopic abundance ratio from target screening function of Peakview 2.0/Masterview1.0 software. Then their structure were determined by analysis of MS/MS fragment or comparison with standard substances and references. Naphthoquinone are the major markers in samples of Juglans mandshurica from different harvest periods. Thirty-eight of naphthalenequinones were identified or inferred in J. mandshurica and contents decline gradually. UPLC-Q-TOF-MS method which develops a new strategy can identify and analyze chemical constituents from J. mandshurica rapidly and accurately, main chemical constituents can be used for quality evaluation and efficacy material research. The dynamic changes in the metabolite accumulation of J. mandshurica the basic data for harvesting medicinal plants at different times."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Heilongjiang Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences, Harbin 150036, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Harbin 150040, China."}], "LastName": "Huo", "ForeName": "Jin-Hai", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Heilongjiang Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences, Harbin 150036, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Guo-Dong", "Initials": "GD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Heilongjiang Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences, Harbin 150036, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Wen-Ting", "Initials": "WT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Heilongjiang Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences, Harbin 150036, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei-Ming", "Initials": "WM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthoquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Juglans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28925121", "10.4268/cjcmm20161812"]}}]}
