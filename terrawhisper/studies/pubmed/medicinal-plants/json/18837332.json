Research and application of gene engineering on medicinal plants are the one of the most promising ways to increase the productivity and quality of medicinal plants, reduce the resource stress, and enhance the competitive power and sustainable development ability of the medicinal plants industry. In spite of the great progress in research and application of plant gene engineering worldwide, the research of gene transformation has mostly been conducted on some model plants, and the application of transgenic plant has been limited to a few staple and important crop species. For medicinal plants, recently the researches of gene transformation has emerged, however, compared with other crop and economic plants, it is still a very limited amount. On the basis of a general introduction of application of transgenic plants, this paper focuses on the present situation of the research and application of gene engineering on medicinal plants, to put forward the problems in this field, and give a prospect for its development."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lu-qi", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Meng-meng", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "42"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18837332"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
