The release of radioactive mannose from GlcNAc[3H]Man5GlcNAc was linear with time and protein concentration with the purified protein, did not show any metal ion requirement, and had a pH optimum of 6.0. The purified enzyme showed a single band on SDS gels that migrated with the Mr 125K standard. The enzyme was very active on GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc but had no activity toward Man5GlcNAc, Man9GlcNAc, Glc3Man9GlcNAc, or other high-mannose oligosaccharides. It did show slight activity toward Man3GlcNAc. The first product of the reaction of enzyme with GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc, i.e., GlcNAcMan4GlcNAc, was isolated by gel filtration and subjected to digestion with endoglucosaminidase H to determine which mannose residue had been removed. This GlcNAcMan4GlcNAc was about 60% susceptible to Endo H indicating that the mannosidase II preferred to remove the alpha 1,6-linked mannose first, but 40% of the time removed the alpha 1,3-linked mannose first. The final product of the reaction, GlcNAcMan3GlcNAc, was characterized by gel filtration and various enzymatic digestions. Mannosidase II was very strongly inhibited by swainsonine and less strongly by 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-mannitol. It was not inhibited by deoxymannojirimycin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio 78284."}], "LastName": "Kaushal", "ForeName": "G P", "Initials": "GP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Szumilo", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pastuszak", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Elbein", "ForeName": "A D", "Initials": "AD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "DK 21800", "Acronym": "DK", "Agency": "NIDDK NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0370623", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2960"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Imino Furanoses"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sugar Alcohols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "100937-53-9", "NameOfSubstance": "1,4-dideoxy-1,4-iminoarabinitol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19130-96-2", "NameOfSubstance": "1-Deoxynojirimycin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "B40ROO395Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Arabinose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Mannosidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.114", "NameOfSubstance": "mannosyl-oligosaccharide 1,3 - 1,6-alpha-mannosidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N08U5BOQ1K", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RSY4RK37KQ", "NameOfSubstance": "Swainsonine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "1-Deoxynojirimycin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arabinose"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Stability"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Imino Furanoses"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Mannosidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sugar Alcohols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swainsonine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2139344", "10.1021/bi00460a030"]}}]}
