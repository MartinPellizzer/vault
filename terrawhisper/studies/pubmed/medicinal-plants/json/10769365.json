Other sample fractions were kept in an incubator at 25 degrees C and 75% Relative Humidity (RH) during 28 days.", "Samples were negative for mites in the first day of analysis and were detected after incubation. Samples incubated revealed a higher percentage of positive examinations for mites (incidence): 31.7% (and 1,845 mites); while samples kept at air temperature showed only 6.9% (and 45 mites). Samples of polished rice were more contaminated in comparison to the ones of beans. There was a larger amount of mites when the mean monthly temperature of the laboratory was between 21.5 degrees C to 22.5 degrees C (37. 8%) and humidity between 73.5% to 74.5% (31.1%).", "The predominant species was Tyrophagus putrescentiae and other identified species were Blomia tropicalis, Cheyletus spp., Blattisocius tarsalis, and others. Mite population had a higher proliferation rate during spring, summer and in the beginning of autumn, due to highest temperature and humidity. These results confirm the importance of improving grains storage, to avoid mites proliferation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laborat\u00f3rio de Microbiologia, Instituto Butantan, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brasil. garoto@usp.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Franzolin", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baggio", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Contaminacao por acaros em arroz polido e feijao comercializados a granel."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Rev Saude Publica", "NlmUniqueID": "0135043", "ISSNLinking": "0034-8910"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Commerce"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Parasitology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Mites"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10769365", "10.1590/s0034-89102000000100014", "S0034-89102000000100014"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
