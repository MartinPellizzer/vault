Free sterols and sterols esters were also isolated in a liquid fraction obtained by low temperature crystallization (-80 C) of the oils and enriched with minor lipid classes. This enrichment procedure provided a liquid fraction suitable for studies of minor components in the oils. However, selectivity towards sterol esters was observed since sterols esterified to very long chain fatty acids (C20-C24) were preferentially retained in the precipitate. The proportion of free and esterified sterols were found to be 0.34% and 0.28%, respectively, in the sunflower oil, whereas the corresponding figures for poppy seed oil were 0.33% and 0.05%. Sunflower oil was characterized by a relatively high percentage of delta 7-sterols, preferentially obtained in the esterified fraction, and by very long chain saturated fatty acids of sterol esters. The sterols in poppy seed oil were composed almost entirely of campesterol, stigmasterol, sitosterol and delta 5-avenasterol, although their percentage distributions were remarkably different in the free and esterified fraction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Johansson", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Lipids", "NlmUniqueID": "0060450", "ISSNLinking": "0024-4201"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Esters"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytosterols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Esters"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Helianthus"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Papaver"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytosterols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "J Am Oil Chem Soc. 1973 Apr;50(4):122-5", "ArticleIdList": ["4707293"]}, {"Citation": "Nahrung. 1975;19(7):547-9", "ArticleIdList": ["1171371"]}, {"Citation": "Nahrung. 1977;21(1):1-6", "ArticleIdList": ["857161"]}, {"Citation": "Lipids. 1978 Oct;13(10):658-65", "ArticleIdList": ["27520108"]}, {"Citation": "J Org Chem. 1967 Apr;32(4):1005-12", "ArticleIdList": ["6042134"]}, {"Citation": "J Am Oil Chem Soc. 1973 Aug;50(8):300-3", "ArticleIdList": ["4785177"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["449631", "10.1007/BF02533916"]}}]}
