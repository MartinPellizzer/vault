The number of pollen tube and length significantly increased when blooming. The flower reaches the ovary and even enters the ovule to complete the fertilization. \u2463When the OCI=4 and P/O=11 684, it means that the breeding system was facultative, outcrossing, and requiring pollinators based on the results of the bagging experiment.There was parthenogenesis. \u2464The characteristics of saponin pollination were wind pollination and insect vector pollination, and pollinators were initially identified as Apis mellifera ligustica.
