A positive correlation was confirmed between the sennoside A content and cathartic effects in our experiments. Furthermore, the effects of Shisendaio [symbol: see text], with a higher sennoside A content, and Kinmondaio [symbol: see text], with a lower sennoside A content, exhibited endotoxin-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) which related closely to Oketsu symptoms, and these effects were examined in rats. Kinmondaio exhibited weak inhibition on both reducing erythrocyte deformability and prolonging euglobulin lysis time (ELT) in DIC rats. From our results, it is possible to evaluate rhubarb's cathartic effect, one of its main drug effects, by examining the rhubarb's sennoside A content. However, it is difficult to estimate the cathartic effect according to the general market name of Rhubarb. No dramatic effect was found on the experimental models used for Oketsu symptoms such as endotoxin-induced DIC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kinki University, Osaka, Japan."}], "LastName": "Harima", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsuda", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kubo", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthraquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cathartics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sennosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8013-11-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Senna Extract"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anthraquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cathartics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Endotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Deformability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rheum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Senna Extract"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sennosides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7703978", "10.1248/bpb.17.1522"]}}]}
