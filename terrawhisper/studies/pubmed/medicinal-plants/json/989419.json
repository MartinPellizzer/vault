Steady-state conditions were achieved by repeated i.v. injections of ouabain, digoxin, beta-methyldigoxin, digitoxin, and oleandrin over 5 days. 5 h after the last application glycoside concentrations were measured in plasma, urine, heart, cerebrum and cerebellum. Furthermore the metabolic pattern in these compartments was determined. 1. The glycoside concentration in the heart per g wet weight ranges only from 0.93 (oleandrin) to 1.88% (ouabain) of the daily administered dose per kg. 2. The concentrations in the brain show much higher differences between the diverse glycosides: ouabain with a concentration of 0.02%/g wet weight in the cerebrum shows the lowest and oleandrin with 1.60% the highest value. 3. By calculating the mean relative weights for the hearts (3.9 g/kg) and the brains (11.1 g/kg) 3.7% of the daily administered ouabain activity were found in the whole heart and only 0.18% in the whole brain. In contrast to these data the content of heart and brain after giving the more lipophilic oleandrin was 3.6% and 17.7% (!), respectively. 4. Under steady-state conditions the glycosides ouabain, digoxin, beta-methyldigoxin and digitoxin in heart and brain are mainly unchanged whereas oleandrin is transformed at a higher rate to polar metabolites."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Flasch", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Heinz", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Konzentration von Herzglykosiden im Myokard und im Gehirn."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Arzneimittelforschung", "NlmUniqueID": "0372660", "ISSNLinking": "0004-4172"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiac Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5ACL011P69", "NameOfSubstance": "Ouabain"}, {"RegistryNumber": "73K4184T59", "NameOfSubstance": "Digoxin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E90NZP2L9U", "NameOfSubstance": "Digitoxin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiac Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cats"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Digitoxin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Digoxin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ouabain"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1976", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["989419"]}}]}
