Proteolytic cleavage at the MA-CA junction of the retroviral gag polyprotein refolds the amino-terminal end of capsid into a beta-helix structure that is stabilized by a salt bridge between the protein's processed amino-terminus and a conserved acidic residue. The refolded capsid aminoterminus then creates a new CA-CA interface, allowing assembly of the mature capsid core. Recently, researches focus on assembly of CA in vitro and development of CA vaccine. CA vaccine will provide widely immune protection because CA is comparatively conserved. Experiments demonstrate that fusing as few as four matrix residues onto the amino-terminus of capsid redirects protein assembly from cylinder to spheres in vitro. Evaluation of immunogenicity showed that immunization with virus-like particles induced both cellular and neutralizing antibody responses. Furthermore, mucosal administration of virus-like particles effectively induced both mucosal and systemic immune responses. These results indicate that virus-like particles consisting of HIV structural proteins are an attractive vaccine platform for eliciting anti-viral immune responses, especially neutralizing antibody responses. The production of antigens for vaccines in plants indicates that plant-based transgenic expression represents a viable means of producing CA vaccine for the development of HIV vaccine and for use in HIV diagnostic procedures and it has the potential as a safe and cost-effective alternative to traditional production systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Biotech-Drugs of Ministry of Health, Shandong Medicinal Biotechnology Center, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250062, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xiao-Guang", "Initials": "XG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Chang-Zheng", "Initials": "CZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9426463", "ISSNLinking": "1000-3061"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "AIDS Vaccines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsid Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "AIDS Vaccines"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Capsid"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Capsid Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "HIV-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Virion"}], "NumberOfReferences": "20"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15969076"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
