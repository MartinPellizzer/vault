Modification of tonoplast vesicles and purified vacuolar H(+)-PPase from etiolated mung bean seedlings with tetranitromethane (TNM) resulted in a progressive decline in H(+)-translocating pyrophosphatase activity. The half-maximal inhibition was brought about by 0.6, 1.0, and 0.8 mM TNM for purified and membrane-bound H(+)-PPases, and its associated proton translocation, respectively. The maximal inhibition of vacuolar H(+)-PPase by TNM occurred at a pH value above 8. Loss of activity of purified H(+)-pyrophosphatase followed pseudo-first order rate kinetics, yielding a first-order rate constant (k2) of 0.039 s(-1) and a steady-state dissociation constant of inactivation (Ki) of 0.02 mM. Covalent modification of vacuolar H(+)-PPase by TNM increased Km value of the enzyme for its substrate without a significant effect on Vmax. Double logarithmic plots of the pseudo-first order rate constant (kobs) versus TNM concentration exhibited a slope of 0.88, suggesting that at least one tyrosine residue was involved in the inactivation of H(+)-PPase enzymatic activity. Further spectrophotometric measurements of the nitrated H(+)-pyrophosphatase indicated that TNM could modify approximately two tyrosine residues/subunit of the enzyme. However, Tsou's analysis revealed that only one of those modified tyrosine residues directly participated in the inhibition of enzymatic activity of vacuolar H(+)-PPase. The physiological substrate, i.e., dimagnesium pyrophosphate, provided substantial protection against inactivation by TNM. Moreover, NEM pretreatment of the enzyme decreased the number of subsequent nitration of vacuolar H(+)-PPase. Taken together, we suggest that vacuolar H(+)-pyrophosphatase contains a substrate-protectable tyrosine residue conferring to the inhibition of its activity and this tyrosine residue may be located in a domain sensitive to the modification of Cys-634 by NEM."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Radiation Biology, College of Nuclear Science, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tzeng", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kuo", "ForeName": "S Y", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hung", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biochim Biophys Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0217513", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42HK56048U", "NameOfSubstance": "Tyrosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrophosphatases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Inorganic Pyrophosphatase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K1G7CKU98F", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetranitromethane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inorganic Pyrophosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrophosphatases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tetranitromethane"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tyrosine"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Vacuoles"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "5", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8639720", "10.1016/0167-4838(96)00005-2", "0167-4838(96)00005-2"]}}]}
