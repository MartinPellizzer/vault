Previous phytochemical studies have shown this genus are rich sources of alkaloids, glycosides, and terpenoids, which have attracted considerable attention of many researchers due to their markedly diverse and complex architecture. The crude extracts as well as the monomeric compounds from the title genus possess anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anti-oxidant pharmacological activities. Besides, some isolates from Alangium exhibited the effects on skeletal, smooth muscle and the nervous system. As a large genus of medicinal plants, the medicinal value of Alangium has been widely reported, but there is no review that provide a systematic summary towards its chemical constituents and pharmacological activities, to our knowledge. This work aims to present a comprehensive overview on the traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacological activities of medicinal plants in the genus Alangium, and to explore the evidence supporting its ethnopharmacological effectiveness."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
