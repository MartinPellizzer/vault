In Magnaporthe oryzae, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) catabolic pathway was found essential for successful host colonization and pathogenicity. GlcNAc catabolic enzymes hexokinase, GlcNAc-6-phosphate deacetylase (MoDac) and GlcN-6-phosphate deaminase (MoDeam) are encoded in a genomic cluster in M. oryzae and several phytopathogenic fungi. However, transcriptional regulation of GlcNAc catabolic pathway was not understood. We identified a conserved Ndt80/PhoG-like transcriptional regulator as a part of the GlcNAc catabolic gene cluster in M. oryzae and other fungi. We found that MoNdt80 is essential for GlcNAc utilization and pathogenicity of M. oryzae. Unlike WT, \u0394MoNdt80 failed to induce transcription of GlcNAc catabolic pathway genes in response to GlcNAc. MoNdt80 could bind to a specific cis-acting consensus sequence GNCRCAAA[AT], present in the promoter of MoDac, MoDeam and \u03b2-hexosaminidase (MoHex). Further, comparative RNA-sequencing analysis using WT and \u0394MoNdt80 revealed a large set of GlcNAc responsive genes that are under the transcriptional control of MoNdt80. These genes encoded GlcNAc catabolic enzymes, transporters and cell wall degrading enzymes which are required for hyphal growth expansion during host colonization. Overall, these results suggest MoNdt80 mediated transcriptional regulation of GlcNAc catabolic pathway is essential for successful host colonization and pathogenesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier GmbH.
