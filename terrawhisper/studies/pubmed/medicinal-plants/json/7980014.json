This interference phenomenon was studied by determining the amount, distribution and localization of both strains in the part of stem between primary leaves and first trifoliolate leaf in both challenge-inoculated and singly inoculated (control) plants. In dot-blot immunoassay, NL3 was detected seven days after its inoculation as challenger, whereas in control plants its presence was established on day four. Immunostained thick sections revealed a large accumulation of NL3 antigen on day eight in both phloem and cambium, but not yet in the xylem and cortex, contrasted with the controls. In immunogold-silver stained semi-thin sections, most of the NL3 label was present in the companion cells and other phloem parenchyma cells, while in the control plants this virus was also present in xylem vessels and xylem parenchyma cells. Inducer strain NY15 was abundantly present in practically all the cells, including xylem vessels, from day two after challenge inoculation onwards. It is concluded that inducer strain NY15 hampers transport of NL3 to, and its spread in, the stem and prevents the latter strain from exerting its deleterious influence on the water conducting elements."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Virology, Agricultural University, Wageningen, The Netherlands."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lohuis", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Goldbach", "ForeName": "R W", "Initials": "RW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dijkstra", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Arch Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "7506870", "ISSNLinking": "0304-8608"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunologic Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Potyvirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viral Interference"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Arch Virol Suppl. 1992;5:415-31", "ArticleIdList": ["1280510"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Virol Suppl. 1992;5:407-14", "ArticleIdList": ["1450767"]}, {"Citation": "J Gen Virol. 1993 Oct;74 ( Pt 10):2243-9", "ArticleIdList": ["8409946"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7980014", "10.1007/BF01310041"]}}]}
