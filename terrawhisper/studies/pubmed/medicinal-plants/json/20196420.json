Platelet aggregation test before Chantaleela ingestion was done as a control. After administration of 750 mg Chantaleela (3 x 250 mg tablets) every 8 hours for 3 doses, platelet aggregation was measured 8 hours following the first dose using an aggregometer and microplate reader. Adrenaline (Adr) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) were used as platelet stimulants. Platelet aggregation was measured again at 32 hours and 8-10 days after the first dose.", "All of the participants completed the present study without any adverse event. Ayurved Siriraj Chantaleela did not affect platelet aggregation; neither Adr nor ADP were used as platelet agonists in both aggregometer and microplate reader Subgroup analysis revealed no significant change in platelet aggregation after Chantaleela administration according to the control for both male and female groups. The same results were also obtained in other subgroup analysis including hyperaggregation group, hypo-normal aggregation group.", "From the present study, normal dose of Chantaleela for alleviation of fever does not have an effect on either platelet aggregation or platelet numbers. It may conclude that the present study supports the safety use of Chantaleela for relieving fever as platelet status does not need to be taken into consideration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Itthipanichpong", "ForeName": "Rath", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lupreechaset", "ForeName": "Arunee", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chotewuttakorn", "ForeName": "Sirikul", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akarasereenont", "ForeName": "Pravit", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Onkoksoong", "ForeName": "Tasanee", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Palo", "ForeName": "Titchaporn", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kongpatanakul", "ForeName": "Supornchai", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chatsiricharoenkul", "ForeName": "Somruedee", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thitilertdecha", "ForeName": "Premrutai", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Punpeng", "ForeName": "Prasopporn", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laohapand", "ForeName": "Tawee", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Thailand", "MedlineTA": "J Med Assoc Thai", "NlmUniqueID": "7507216", "ISSNLinking": "0125-2208"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Platelets"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20196420"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
