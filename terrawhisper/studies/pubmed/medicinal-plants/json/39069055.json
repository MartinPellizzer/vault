We employed biotechnological strategies to enhance viridiflorol production, which could significantly boost export revenue. Mentha piperita L. sesquiterpene synthase (MpTPS4) was the focus of our study because it is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of viridiflorol. Through biochemical characterization, we confirmed that MpTPS4 exclusively synthesizes viridiflorol. By overexpressing MpTPS4 in M. \u00d7piperita L. using a glandular trichome-specific promoter, we achieved a notable increase (9-25\u00a0%) in viridiflorol content. Additionally, we explored the practical application of viridiflorol as a deterrent against the herbivore Helicoverpa armigera. The RNAi-mediated knockdown of MpTPS4 resulted in a significant reduction in viridiflorol levels in the essential oil. More importantly, these results show how relevant MpTPS4 is for making viridiflorol and how biotechnology could be used to increase biosynthesis. Our research provides valuable insights into enhancing the production of this commercially important sesquiterpene, offering promising opportunities for the mentha industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
