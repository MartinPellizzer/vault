Heart failure diagnosis was evaluated objectively by means of a score proposed by Carlson et al.", "From a total number of 881 patients, 114 (13%) were receiving digoxin. Mean age was 66 +/- 13 years and 47% were males. Considering the patients who were taking digoxin, 32% presented scores compatible with definite or possible heart failure; 26% had atrial flutter or fibrillation; 18% had heart failure and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias; and in 24% no clear indications were found according to our criteria. Previous use of digoxin was found in 85% of the patients and 32% were withdrawn during the hospitalization. Considering just the patients who had no reason for using digoxin, only 44% had the drug withdrawn.", "According to current criteria, many hospitalized patients receive digoxin without a definite indication.
