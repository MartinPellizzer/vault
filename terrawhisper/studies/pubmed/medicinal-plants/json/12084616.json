Treatment of lymphocytes to various concentrations of SC resulted in a dose dependent increase in the micronuclei-induction, especially after 25-100 microg/ml extract. The exposure of human lymphocytes to various concentrations of SC extract before 3 Gy gamma-irradiation resulted in a significant decline in the micronuclei-induction at all the drug doses when compared with the non-drug treated irradiated cultures. A nadir in MNBNC frequency was observed for 12.5 microg/ml drug concentration, where the MNBNC frequency was approximately fourfold lower than that of the non-drug treated irradiated cultures. Therefore, this dose may be considered as an optimum dose for radiation protection. Our study demonstrates that the leaf extract of S. cumini, a plant traditionally used to treat diabetic disorders protects against the radiation-induced DNA damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiobiology, Kasturba Medical College, 576 119, Karnataka, Manipal, India. gc.jagetia@kmc.manipal.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jagetia", "ForeName": "Ganesh Chandra", "Initials": "GC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baliga", "ForeName": "Manjeshwar Shrinath", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7709027", "ISSNLinking": "0378-4274"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Micronucleus Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Myrtaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12084616", "10.1016/s0378-4274(02)00032-2", "S0378427402000322"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
