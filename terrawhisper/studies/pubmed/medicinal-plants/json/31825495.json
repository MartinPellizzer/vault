This cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the seroprevalence and the risk factors associated with Toxocara infection in nomads of Boyer-Ahmad County in the southwest of Iran.", "A total of 968 blood samples were collected from nomads. A structured questionnaire, containing sociodemographic data, was completed for each participant. Sera were evaluated for anti-Toxocara antibodies, using the T. canis excretory-secretory antigens prepared from the second stage larvae, in an ELISA system.", "Among the 968 participants, 220 (22.7%) were males and 748 (77.3%) were females; the mean age was 40.71\u00a0y. Anti-Toxocara IgG antibodies were detected in 14 (1.4%) of the 968 nomads. The association between Toxocara infection and gender, age, contact with dogs, residential area and level of education were not statistically significant (p>0.05).", "The findings of the study revealed a low prevalence rate of toxocariasis in nomadic communities in southwest Iran. Geographic location and climatic conditions as well as the lifestyle and sociodemographic features of the participants may contribute to the low prevalence rate of Toxocara infection."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.
