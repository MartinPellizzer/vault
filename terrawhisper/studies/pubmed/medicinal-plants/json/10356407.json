It is a reconstituted mixture of 3 triterpenes extracted from the plant, asiatic acid, madecassic acid and asiaticoside. In this report, we studied the effects of TECA and its separated components in the wound chamber model described by Schilling et al. Stainless steel wound chambers were surgically inserted under the skin of rats and received serial injections of either TECA or its purified components. Chambers were collected at days 7, 14, 21 or 28 for biochemical analysis or histological examination. TECA-injected wound chambers were characterized by increased dry weight, DNA, total protein, collagen and uronic acid contents. Peptidic hydroproline was also increased, showing an increased remodeling of the collagen matrix in the wound. The 3 purified components of TECA were all able to reproduce the effects of the complete drug, with some differences depending on the product. Asiatic acid and asiaticoside were the most active of the 3 triterpenes. Asiaticoside exerted a preferential stimulation of collagen synthesis and was active at low doses only. In addition to collagen, the 3 components were also able to stimulate glycosaminoglycan synthesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biochemistry, UPRESA CNRS 6021, IFR-53 Biomol\u00e9cules, Faculty of Medicine, Reims, France. fmaquart@chu-reims.fr"}], "LastName": "Maquart", "ForeName": "F X", "Initials": "FX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chastang", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Simeon", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Birembaut", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gillery", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wegrowski", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Dermatol", "NlmUniqueID": "9206420", "ISSNLinking": "1167-1122"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentacyclic Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "TECA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Uronic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9PA5A687X5", "NameOfSubstance": "asiatic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M7O1N24J82", "NameOfSubstance": "madecassic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PKO39VY215", "NameOfSubstance": "asiaticoside"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RMB44WO89X", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyproline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Extracellular Matrix"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyproline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pentacyclic Triterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["injuries", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Uronic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10356407"]}}]}
