In this study it was found that OA had antimycobacterial properties against eight clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis and that the MICs of OA against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant isolates were 50-100 and 100-200 microg ml(-1), respectively. The combination of OA with isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP) or ethambutol (EMB) showed favourable synergistic antimycobacterial effects against six drug-resistant strains, with fractional inhibitory concentration indices of 0.121-0.347, 0.113-0.168 and 0.093-0.266, respectively. The combination treatments of OA/INH, OA/RMP and OA/EMB displayed either a synergistic interaction or did not show any interaction against two drug-sensitive strains. No antagonism resulting from the OA/INH, OA/RMP or OA/EMB combination was observed for any of the strains tested. OA exhibited a relatively low cytotoxicity in Vero cells. These results indicate that OA may serve as a promising lead compound for future antimycobacterial drug development."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key
