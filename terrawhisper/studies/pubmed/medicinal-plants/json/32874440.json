Despite numerous studies, the biological effects of human exposure to different levels of RF-EMF are not fully understood yet. This study aimed to evaluate the bioeffects of exposure to \"900/1800 MHz\" and \"2.4 GHz\" RF-EMFs, and x-rays alone as well as their potential interactions, i.e. inducing simple additive, adaptive, or synergistic effects.", "120 Wistar rats were randomly divided into ten groups of 12 each. The rats were exposed to RF-EMF, 10 cGy, and 8 Gy x-rays, a combination of these exposures, or only sham-exposed. The levels of liver enzymes were determined in serum samples by an auto-analyzer. Moreover, the histopathological changes, and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide, ferric reducing antioxidant power, total thiols, and protein carbonyl (PCO) were measured.", "Among the markers of liver function, gamma-glutamyltransferase was not associated with irradiation but, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase showed some levels of association. MDA and PCO levels after 8 Gy irradiation increased, but pre-exposure to RF-EMF could modulate their changes. At the cellular level, the frequency of lobular inflammation was associated with the type of intervention.", "The exposure to both ionizing and non-ionizing radiations could alter some liver function tests. A short term pre-exposure to RF-EMF before exposure to an 8 Gy challenging dose of x-rays caused the alterations in oxidative stress markers and liver function tests, which indicate that oxidative stress is possibly involved in the adaptive response."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Biology Research Center, Health Research Institute, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Borzoueisileh", "ForeName": "Sajad", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Research Center, Health Research Institute, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol Iran."}], "LastName": "Shabestani Monfared", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pathology Department, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Physics, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mortazavi", "ForeName": "S M J", "Initials": "SMJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Biology Research Center, Health Research Institute, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zabihi", "ForeName": "Ebrahim", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Biology Research Center, Health Research Institute, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Pouramir", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Doustimotlagh", "ForeName": "Amir Hossein", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shafiee", "ForeName": "Mohsen", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Research Center, Health Research Institute, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Physics Radiobiology and Radiation Protection, School of Medicine, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Niksirat", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Caspian J Intern Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101523876", "ISSNLinking": "2008-6164"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Abdel-Misih SR, Bloomston M.
