We found that resveratrol, at doses of 2.5 and 10 mg/kg, significantly reduced the tumor volume (42%), tumor weight (44%) and metastasis to the lung (56%) in mice bearing highly metastatic Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumors, but not at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg. Resveratrol did not affect the number of CD4(+), CD8(+) and natural killer (NK)1.1.(+) T cells in the spleen. Therefore, the inhibitory effects of resveratrol on tumor growth and lung metastasis could not be explained by natural killer or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activation. In addition, resveratrol inhibited DNA synthesis most strongly in LLC cells; its 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) was 6.8 micromol/L. Resveratrol at 100 micromol/L increased apoptosis to 20.6 +/- 1.35% from 12.1 +/- 0.36% (P < 0.05) in LLC cells, and decreased the S phase population to 22.1 +/- 1.03% and 29.2 +/- 0.27% from 35.2 +/- 1.72% (P < 0.05) at concentrations of 50 and 100 micromol/L, respectively. Resveratrol inhibited tumor-induced neovascularization at doses of 2.5 and 10 mg/kg in an in vivo model. Moreover, resveratrol significantly inhibited the formation of capillary-like tube formation from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) at concentrations of 10-100 micromol/L; the degree of the inhibition of capillary-like tube formation by resveratrol was 45.5% at 10 micromol/L, 50.2% at 50 micromol/L and 52.6% at 100 micromol/L. Resveratrol inhibited the binding of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to HUVEC at concentrations of 10-100 micromol/L, but not at concentrations of 1 and 5 micromol/L. The degree of inhibition of VEGF binding to HUVEC by resveratrol was 16.9% at 10 micromol/L, 53.2% at 50 micromol/L and 47.8% at 100 micromol/L. We suggest that the antitumor and antimetastatic activities of resveratrol might be due to the inhibition of DNA synthesis in LLC cells and the inhibition of LLC-induced neovascularization and tube formation (angiogensis) of HUVEC by resveratrol"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Second Department of Medical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Ehime University, Shigenobu-cho, Onsen-gun, Ehime 791-0295, Japan. yokim@m.ehime-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kimura", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okuda", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Angiogenesis Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Stilbenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q369O8926L", "NameOfSubstance": "Resveratrol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Angiogenesis Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "CD4-CD8 Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Lewis Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control", "secondary"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Metastasis"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Neovascularization, Pathologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polygonaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Resveratrol"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Stilbenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Thymus Gland"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11385077", "10.1093/jn/131.6.1844"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
