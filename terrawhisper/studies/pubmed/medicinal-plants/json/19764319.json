The grain filling speed, intensity, dry matter accumulation in head spike were all higher than those in the second spike, which resulted in early peak. The seeds in the head spike had advantages in grain filling and their adapted harvesting time should be the 13th day after blooming, when there were 86.2% of dry the maximum matter accumulation and 68.8% as water content in seeds. However, the adapted harvesting time for the seeds in the second spike should be the 14th day after the first spike bloomed, when there were 82.0% of the maximum dry matter accumulation and 72.2% as water content.", "According with the Logistic equation, the grains filling in different spikes had the same duration but differed in the intersity.
