Ethyl acetate-ethyl methyl ketone-formic acid 98%-water (50:30:10:10) were chosen among different examined mobile phases. Liebermann-Burchard and anisaldehyde reagents were chosen for HPTLC derivatisation for visualisation. Image analysis based on Cannys' method was used to determine the spot size of each HPTLC image. A similarity search algorithm based on colour (RGB, HSV and Lab) information alone or together with retardation factor (R<sub>f</sub> ) and spot size information calculated with the software was built to assess the fingerprinting of medicinal plants.", "The software was capable of calculating spots size and R<sub>f</sub> values. It authenticated unknown samples based on comparing images information, spots size and/or R<sub>f</sub> in the built database. Similarity values were 75-96% for the selected plants chromatograms with those of the same plant in the database. It presents better results than principal components analysis (PCA), classification and regression trees (CART) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA).", "The procedure paves the way for constructing a database of HPTLC images of medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ebrahimi-Najafabadi", "ForeName": "Heshmatollah", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kazemeini", "ForeName": "Seyed Sina", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Processing Research Centre, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Pasdaran", "ForeName": "Ardalan", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6021-6730"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Processing Research Centre, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hamedi", "ForeName": "Azadeh", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "94-01-70-9614", "Agency": "Shiraz University of Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochem Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "9200492", "ISSNLinking": "0958-0344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Software"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30779265", "10.1002/pca.2823"]}}]}
