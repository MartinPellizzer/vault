Well-developed shoots (>3cm) were successfully rooted on MS medium supplemented with NAA (0.1 mg/l). Protein and total soluble sugar contents were maximum during organogenesis and multiple shoot induction phase compared with non-organogenic callus and root induction phase. Esterase and catalase activities were maximum during organogenic differentiation, while activities were minimum at non-differentiated callus stages. Peroxidase activities were higher during rhizogenesis. Contradiction to peroxidase activity, acid phosphatase activities were high during organogenesis and declined during rhizogenesis. SDS-PAGE analysis of total soluble proteins revealed expression of non-organogenic callus (97.9 kDa), organogenic callus (77.2, 74.1, 21.9 kDa), multiple shoot induction phase (106.6, 26.9, 11.6 kDa) and root induction phase (15.9 kDa) specific polypeptides. Esterase zymogram revealed one band (Rm 0.204) appeared in both organogenic callus and multiple shoot induction phase. Peroxidase zymogram detected two stage specific bands, one band (Rm 0.42) was specific to root induction phase, while another (Rm 0.761) was specific to multiple shoot induction. Catalase and acid phosphatase zymogram resolved one band (Rm 0.752 and 0.435, respectively) in differentiated stages including both multiple shoot induction phase and root induction phase, but absent in undifferentiated phases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Tissue Culture Laboratory, Division of Biotechnology, Majhighariani Institute of Technology and Science, Sriram Vihar, Rayagada 765 001, India. jogesh_ck@yahoo.co.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Panigrahi", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Behera", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maharana", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "R R", "Initials": "RR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Esterases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Acid Phosphatase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acanthaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acid Phosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Esterases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17948741"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
