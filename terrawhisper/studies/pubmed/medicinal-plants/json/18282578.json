In this method, sodium 1-octanesulfonate has been used as an ion complexation agent for NDELA. The resulting complex was analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a Eurospher-100 C18 column (250 x 4.6 mm, 5 microm), water/acetonitrile (95/5, v/v) and UV detection at 234 nm. The detector response was linear in the range 0.03-10.00 microg mL(-1) and the limit of detection was 0.01 microg mL(-1). The complexation of the NDELA and sodium 1-octanesulfonate was confirmed by negative ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry at m/z 327 [M-Na](-) and also MS/MS measurements of the resulting fragments. For real sample analyses, NDELA was measured in cosmetic products after clean up by solid-phase extraction (SPE) with C(18) cartridge for water-soluble samples and liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) by methylene chloride for less water-soluble samples. The average values for NDELA recovery by SPE and LLE were 86.9 and 51.8% and relative standard deviations (RSDs%) were 0.9 and 5.6%, respectively. The presented method is easy to use, robust and can be implemented on any reversed-phase HPLC system with UV detection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Evin, Tehran, Iran. aghassempour@scientist.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghassempour", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abbaci", "ForeName": "Monireh", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Talebpour", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Spengler", "ForeName": "Bernhard", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "R\u00f6mpp", "ForeName": "Andreas", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cosmetics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "30YI1289VY", "NameOfSubstance": "N-nitrosodiethanolamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3IQ78TTX1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Diethylnitrosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cosmetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Diethylnitrosamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18282578", "10.1016/j.chroma.2007.12.045", "S0021-9673(07)02243-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
