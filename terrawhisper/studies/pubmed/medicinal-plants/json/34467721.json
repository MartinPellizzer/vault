The investigation on the diversity of P6 H genes in the medicinal Papaver plants contributes to the acquirement of P6 H with high activity to increase the biosynthesis of sanguinarine. Five P6 H genes in P. somniferum, P. orientale, and P. rhoeas were discovered based on the re-sequencing data of the Papaver species, followed by bioinformatics analysis. With the elongation factor 1\u03b1(EF-1\u03b1), which exhibits stable expression in the root and stem, as the internal reference gene, the transcription levels of P6H genes in roots and stems of the Papaver plants were detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. As indicated by the re-sequencing results, there were two genotypes of P6H in P. somniferum and P. orientale, respectively, and only one in P. rhoeas. The bioinformatics analysis showed that the P6 H proteins of the three Papaver plants contained the conserved domain cl12078, which is the characteristic of p450 supergene family, and transmembrane regions. The existence of signal peptide remained verification. Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR results revealed that the transcription level of P6 H in roots of P. somniferum was about 1.44 times of that in stems(\u03b1=0.05). The present study confirmed genetic diversity of P6 H in the three medicinal Papaver plants, which lays a basis for the research on the biosynthesis pathway and mechanism of sanguinarine in Papaver species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academician Workstation, Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330004, China National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Tian-Hua", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jun-Hui", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yu-Yang", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu Academy of Agri-Engineering Technology Wuwei 733000, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Yu-Jie", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu Academy of Agri-Engineering Technology Wuwei 733000, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu Academy of Agri-Engineering Technology Wuwei 733000, China."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Yong-Fu", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academician Workstation, Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330004, China National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lu-Qi", "Initials": "LQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzophenanthridines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "UIW569HT35", "NameOfSubstance": "protopine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzophenanthridines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Berberine Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Papaver"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "53"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34467721", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210522.102"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
