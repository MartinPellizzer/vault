G. Don. is an important medicinal plant with rich sources of remarkable health benefits consisting more than 100 alkaloids and significant amounts of bioactive compounds, which have been widely used as a folk medicine for treatment of several pathologies.", "In the present study, we isolated and cultured innately undifferentiated cambium meristematic cells (CMCs), which were observed stable cell growth, enhancement of bioactive compounds from C.roseus.", "We attempted to determine the effect of association between time-course growth rates, bioactive compounds and terpenoids indole alkaloid (TIA) contents as well as antioxidant and anticancer efficacies of C. roseus CMC suspension culture treated by UV-C.", "The bioactive compounds, vincristine contents, and antioxidant power were noticed significantly higher in 60\u202fmin exposure at 5\u202fcm distances and with the directly collected sample (T7). A similar trend has also been noticed from the anticancer activity. Demonstration of TIA accumulation was found higher at 5\u202fmin exposure, at 20\u202fcm distances and 48\u202fh of incubation (T21) and the result of TIA contents had the highest correlation effects of anticancer activities.", "In the current study, we demonstrated that UV-C light could enhance the production of the essential compounds and bioactivities in the CMCs of C. roseus, and thus, C. roseus CMCs have the potential to serve as an industrial platform for the production of bioactive alkaloids and antioxidant, anticancer activity. Moreover, additional efforts should be made to irradiate CMC suspension cultures from C. roseus with UV-C to achieve better pharmacological profiles."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
