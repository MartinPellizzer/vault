The essential oil of L. pterodonta, which exhibits various pharmacological activities, is a rich resource of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. To date, however, the terpene synthases responsible for their production remain unknown. In present study, a new terpene synthase gene (LpNES1) was identified from L. pterodonta, transcript level of which was significantly upregulated in response to methyl jasmonate treatment. Recombinant LpNES1 could synthesize (E)-nerolidol and minor \u03b2-farnesene from farnesyl diphosphate and linalool from geranyl diphosphate in vitro. Whereas, only sesquiterpenes including (E)-nerolidol and minor \u03b2-farnesene were released when LpNES1 was reconstituted in yeast, even coexpressed with a geranyl diphosphate synthase (ERG20<sup>WW</sup>). Combined with subcellular localization experiment, the result indicated that the cytosol-targeted LpNES1 was responsible for (E)-nerolidol biosynthesis exclusively in L. pterodonta. Additionally, the expression level of LpNES1 gene was more prominent in floral buds than that in other tissues. LpNES1 characterized in present study not only lays the molecular foundation for sesquiterpene biosynthesis of L. pterodonta, but provides a key element for further biosynthesis of bioactive compound in microbes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Key Laboratory of Microbial Diversity in Southwest China, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Institute of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Yunnan University."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Zhan-Ku", "Initials": "ZK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Key Laboratory of Microbial Diversity in Southwest China, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Institute of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Yunnan University."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "R&D Center of China Tobacco Yunnan Industrial Co., Ltd."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Xiao-Wei", "Initials": "XW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Key Laboratory of Microbial Diversity in Southwest China, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Institute of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Yunnan University."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jiang-Yuan", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Key Laboratory of Microbial Diversity in Southwest China, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Institute of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Yunnan University."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ming-Gang", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Key Laboratory of Microbial Diversity in Southwest China, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Institute of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Yunnan University."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Xiu-Lin", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7621-1563"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Key Laboratory of Microbial Diversity in Southwest China, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Institute of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Yunnan University."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Meng-Liang", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Oleo Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101175339", "ISSNLinking": "1345-8957"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxylipins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "900N171A0F", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl jasmonate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkyl and Aryl Transferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "terpene synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QR6IP857S6", "NameOfSubstance": "nerolidol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetates"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Alkyl and Aryl Transferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxylipins"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Up-Regulation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "46"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34645748", "10.5650/jos.ess21172"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
