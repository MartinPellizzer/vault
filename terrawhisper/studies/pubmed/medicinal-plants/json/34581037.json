Some medicinal plants of Solanaceae are rich in tropane alkaloids(TAs), which have significant pharmacological activities. In this paper, the geographical distribution, chemical components, traditional therapeutic effect, pharmacological activities, and biosynthetic pathways of TAs in Solanaceous plants were summarized. Besides, the phylogeny of medicinal plants belonging to Solanaceae was visualized by network diagram. Fourteen genera of Solanaceae plants in China contain TAs and have medical records. TAs mainly exist in Datura, Anisodus, Atropa, Physochlaina, and Hyoscyamus. The TAs-containing species were mainly concentrated in Southwest China, and the content of TAs was closely related to plant distribution area and altitude. The Solanaceae plants containing TAs mainly have antispasmodic, analgesic, antiasthmatic, and antitussive effects. Modern pharmacological studies have proved the central sedative, pupil dilating, glandular secretion-inhibiting, and anti-asthma activities of TAs. These pharmacological activities provide a reasonable explanation for the traditional therapeutic efficacy of tropane drugs. In this paper, the geographical distribution, chemical components, traditional therapeutic effect, and modern pharmacological activities of TAs-containing species in Solanaceae were analyzed for the first time. Based on these data, the genetic relationship of TAs-containing Solanaceae species was preliminarily discussed, which provided a scientific basis for the basic research on TAs-containing solanaceous species and was of great significance for the development of natural medicinal plant resources containing TAs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baotou Medical College Baotou 014040, China."}], "LastName": "Zang", "ForeName": "Er-Huan", "Initials": "EH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baotou Medical College Baotou 014040, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qin-Yu", "Initials": "QY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baotou Medical College Baotou 014040, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jin-Fan", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inner Mongolia Medical University Hohhot 010110, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Lin-Lin", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inner Mongolia Medical University Hohhot 010110, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xue", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baotou Medical College Baotou 014040, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ming-Xu", "Initials": "MX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baotou Medical College Baotou 014040, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yu-Chao", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu No.1Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
