Following the establishment of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model in rats by modified suture method, neurological function score, cerebral infarction area and pathomorphology were used to evaluate the pharmacological effect that the combination of AST \u2163 and PNS antagonized cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury; the contents of AST \u2163, Rg\u2081, Rb\u2081, R\u2081 in rat plasma of different time points were determined with ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem massspectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated and pharmacokinetics changes of the main effective components were analyzed. The results showed that AST \u2163, PNS alone and their combination could reduce the cerebral infarction area of rats, relieve the behavioral scores of neurologic deficit, improve the pathological changes after cerebral ischemia, the effects of the combination were better. Among AST \u2163, Rg\u2081, Rb\u2081, R\u2081, the area under the curve (AUC) was significantly increased, the mean residence time of (MRT0-t) was delayed, the peak concentration (Cmax) was significantly raised, the apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was reduced, and the clearance rate in vivo was significantly slowed. It suggested that AST \u2163 combined with PNS has synergistic enhancement on anti-cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, moreover, make the pharmacokinetic behavior of the main effective components change, the mechanism may be associated with prolonging the retention time of the effective components in cerebral ischemia condition, elevating the bioavailability."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Prevention and Treatment of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine on Cardio-Cerebral Diseases, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410208, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jing-Xian", "Initials": "JX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Prevention and Treatment of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine on Cardio-Cerebral Diseases, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410208, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Qian", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Prevention and Treatment of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine on Cardio-Cerebral Diseases, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410208, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Biao", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Prevention and Treatment of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine on Cardio-Cerebral Diseases, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410208, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Dan", "Initials": "XD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Prevention and Treatment of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine on Cardio-Cerebral Diseases, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410208, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Ying-Hong", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Prevention and Treatment of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine on Cardio-Cerebral Diseases, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410208, China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Chang-Qing", "Initials": "CQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Prevention and Treatment of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine on Cardio-Cerebral Diseases, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410208, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Ping", "Initials": "XP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3A592W8XKE", "NameOfSubstance": "astragaloside A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax notoginseng"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29235296", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170901.013"]}}]}
