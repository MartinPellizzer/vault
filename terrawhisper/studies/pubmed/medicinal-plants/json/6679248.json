Plantings were spaced 15 days, and the experiment started October 16, 1978 and ended December 15 of the same year. Plantings were made in rows, spaced 1.50 m from each other, leaving a distance of 0.60 m between plants. Their growth was tutored by bamboo poles which led them to a single wire placed horizontally at 1.70 m from the soil. An effect of the planting season was observed on flowering and fructification, since late plantings presented lower values for these characteristics and also decreased the harvesting period of the dry pods. Early plantings led to a higher development of the plants, and also to higher yield values as yield is a consequence of the number of pods per plant, with a high content of seeds per pod. Variety \"UPS-122\" was somewhat late in flowering and more vigorous than \"UPS-31\". The planting season did not affect the protein and oil contents, and average values in seeds of 43% and 17% were obtained, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lam-S\u00e1nchez", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Durigan", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "de Oliveira", "ForeName": "E T", "Initials": "ET"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Negr\u00e3o Serigatto", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Faggioni", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6679248"]}}]}
