Yet, there is a wealth of knowledge available to be tapped from the remedies used in the treatment of animal and zoonotic diseases. The indigenous knowledge available could be rationalized in the modern pharmaceutical context and applied directly to field use where appropriate. Furthermore, it is well known that many drugs have been developed initially through their use in animals because the ethical issues are easier to handle. It is worth examining some the indigenous medicinal plants that are used for both human and animal disease treatment, and determine the practical and cost-effective ways of exploiting the values of these plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kenya Medical Research Institute, Traditional Medicines & Drugs Research Centre, P O Box 54840, Nairobi, Kenya."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kofi-Tsekpo", "ForeName": "M W", "Initials": "MW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kioy", "ForeName": "D W", "Initials": "DW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Kenya", "MedlineTA": "Afr J Health Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9439497", "ISSNLinking": "1022-9272"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17580988"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
