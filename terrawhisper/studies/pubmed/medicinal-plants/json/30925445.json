Tomatoes are generally quite safe to eat. However, overall consumption varies from individual to individual. Indeed, either beneficial or harmful effects of plants or their derived products are closely related to quality, including the presence of biologically active compounds. On the other hand, the synthesis and accumulation of these bioactive molecules depends on many other factors, such as environmental conditions. In this sense, this review briefly highlights the relationship between the chemistry of tomato and its derived products and their beneficial or harmful effects on human health, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or heartburn, allergies, kidney and cardiovascular disorders, prostate cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, lycopenodermia, body aches, arthritis, and urinary problems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
