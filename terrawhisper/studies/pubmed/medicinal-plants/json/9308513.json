He was hospitalized overnight but recovered uneventfully without obvious adverse systemic effects. This plant was almost certainly Podophyllum peltatum based on chromatographic identification of podophyllotoxin in a sample. However, the patient had mistakenly believed he was taking the anticholinergic and hallucinatory plant Mandragora officinarum, which is also known as mandrake. Other users of herbal substances and authors of the medical literature have also confused these 2 versions of mandrake. Given the growing popularity of alternative therapies, physicians should understand the distinction between these substances and should be aware of the medical effects of other commonly used herbal remedies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of South Carolina School of Medicine, Columbia, USA."}], "LastName": "Frasca", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brett", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yoo", "ForeName": "S D", "Initials": "SD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Intern Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0372440", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9926"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "L36H50F353", "NameOfSubstance": "Podophyllotoxin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Emergencies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Podophyllotoxin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Podophyllum"}], "NumberOfReferences": "21"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "10", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9308513", "10.1001/archinte.157.17.2007"]}}]}
