Ronn. from Bulgaria were examined by analytical GC and GC-MS techniques. 39 components were separated in the oil of T. tosevii and 22 of them were identified, representing 94.37% of the oil. The most abundant constituents were: terpinyl acetate (43.59%), thymol (11.43%) and nerol (11.72%). More than 70 components were separated in the essential oil of T. macedonicus, 35 were identified, representing 96.03% of the oil. The major components were geranyl acetate (30.00%) and terpinyl acetate (17.30%), followed by lower amounts of nerol (14.25%), linalool (12.94%) and thymol (4.14%). Both examined taxa contained essential oils composed mainly from monoterpene oxygenate compounds while the fractions of monoterpene hydrocarbons as well as sesquiterpene components were very low."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Skopje, Macedonia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kulevanova", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stoeva", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Risti\u0107", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Boll Chim Farm", "NlmUniqueID": "0372534", "ISSNLinking": "0006-6648"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bulgaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10920534"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
