We have applied colloidal silver and gold nanoparticles as amplifier agents to enhance nucleotide Raman signals. It is observed that without these enhancing agents, it is impossible to investigate nucleotide spectrum due to weak Raman signals. Interaction mechanism of Melphalan, an anticancer drug with four nucleotides (Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, Thymine) was investigated using SERS to detect and identify changes due to alkylating process in Raman spectra. After incubating Melphalan drug with nucleotides for 24\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, some changes occurred in SERS spectrum and interpretation of SERS spectra revealed the influence of the alkyl substitution on peaks and Raman shifts. After incubation of Melphalan with each nucleotide, intensity of relevant SERS signals assigned to Amid III group of Cytosine and Amid I of Thymine decreased significantly, confirming alkylating taking place. In this study, we also investigated the effect of nanoparticles type on nucleotide spectrum. We could not obtain useful information in the cases of guanine nucleotide. The SERS spectrum of Cytosine as an example of nucleotides in aqueous solution compared to solid state and results demonstrated that in solid state better signals were obtained than in liquid state."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
