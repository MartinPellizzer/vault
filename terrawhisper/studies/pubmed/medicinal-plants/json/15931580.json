Elicitation of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, and intradermal injections of compound 48/80, histamine or serotonin induced scratching behavior in ICR mice. Models of irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis were prepared by the topical application of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) on the ears of mice. Topical application of luteolin at concentrations of 20 and 100 mug/site significantly inhibited the number of scratching incidents associated with passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, and a similar tendency was also observed in histamine-, serotonin- and compound 48/80-evoked cutaneous reactions. The vascular permeability increase induced by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis or histamine injection was also significantly reduced by luteolin. Luteolin showed a potent inhibition on the ear thickness increase in models of irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis. In conclusion, luteolin significantly inhibited the scratching behavior associated with allergic cutaneous anaphylaxis. Its effects against pruritus are mainly attributed to its inhibition of mediator release from activated mast cells and direct antagonist effects on the released mediators which may act as local pruritogens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, PR China.
