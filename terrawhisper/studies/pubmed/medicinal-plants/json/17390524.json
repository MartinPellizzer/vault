The urinary infections and the cystitis are very spilled and constitute a problem of public health in developing countries. About 50% of women develop a symptomatic urinary tract infection at least once in their life. The urinary infection is, by order of frequency, the first of the non epidemic infectious illnesses. The objective of our survey is to find in Malian Pharmacopoeia, plants with antibacterial and analgesic properties. Five remedies and their plants used in traditional medicine for the treatment of the urinary tract infections and the cystitis have been selected on the basis of ethnobotanic investigations results. Extracts of five remedies and their plants have been tested for their antibacterial activity on the germs responsible for the urinary infections and the cystitis. Extracts containing Stylosanthes erecta P. Beauv (Fabaceae) demonstrated an antibacterial activity against clinical strains of Escherichia coli, responsible of 75 to 80% of the urinary infections. The same extracts demonstrated an analgesic activity against the pain induced by the acetic acid in mice. The antibacterial and analgesic properties can be of great benefit in the treatment of the urinary tract infections and the cystitis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculte de M\u00e9decine, de Pharmacie et d'Odonto-Stomatologie, Universit\u00e9 de Bamako, Mali. aidemet@afribonemali.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rokia", "ForeName": "Sanogo", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Drissa", "ForeName": "Diallo", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seydou", "ForeName": "Diarra", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Colette", "ForeName": "Ekoumou", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flabou", "ForeName": "Bougoudogo", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Activite antibacterienne et antalgique de deux recettes traditionnelles utilisees dans le traitement des infections urinaires et la cystite au Mali."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Mali", "MedlineTA": "Mali Med", "NlmUniqueID": "18420390R", "ISSNLinking": "0464-7874"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cystitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eukaryota"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mali"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urinary Bladder"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Urinary Tract Infections"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17390524"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
