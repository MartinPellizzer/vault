The study population included patients with functional constipation aged 2-15 years who were referred to the gastrointestinal clinic of Imam Hossein hospital in Isfahan in 2019. Patients were randomly assigned into two treatment groups. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software. The significance level in the present study is considered <0.05.", "Sixty children with functional constipation were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria in this study. The present study results showed no significant difference between demographic characteristics, including age, weight, and gender of children with constipation in the two groups (<i>P</i> > 0.05). The present study results showed that both groups' mean stool consistency and the number of bowel movements increased significantly after the intervention (<i>P</i> < 0.05). However, the number of bowel movements in the first group was significantly higher than in the second group (<i>P</i> < 0.05).", "The present study results showed that both drugs effectively treat children with functional constipation. However, after 8 weeks of intervention, the frequency of bowel movements, pain intensity, and abdominal pain in the group LaxaPlus Barij<sup>\u00ae</sup> was more effective.
