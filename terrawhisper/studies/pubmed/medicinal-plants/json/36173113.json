Our recent research reported the anti-cancer effects of safranal, which further demonstrated its impact on protein translation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA fragmentation. To better understand the underlying mechanisms, we identified acetylated and phosphorylated peptides in safranal-treated cancer cells. We conducted a comprehensive phosphoproteomics and acetylomics analysis of safranal-treated MDA-MB-231 cells by using a combination of TMT labeling and enrichment methods including titanium dioxide and immunoprecipitation. We provide a wide range of phosphoproteome regulation in different signaling pathways that are disrupted by safranal treatment. Safranal influences the phosphorylation level on proteins involved in DNA replication and repair, translation, and EGFR activation/accumulation, which can lead the cells into apoptosis. Safranal causes DNA damage which is followed by the activation of cell cycle checkpoints for DNA repair. Over time, checkpoints and DNA repair are inhibited and cells are under a mitotic catastrophe. Moreover, safranal prevents repair by the hypo-acetylation of H4 and facilitates the transcription of proapoptotic genes by hyper-acetylation of H3, which push the cells to the brink of death."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran 1983963113, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ashrafian", "ForeName": "Shahrbanou", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6578-6540"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran 1983963113, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Karolinska Institutet, Solna SE17165, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Zarrineh", "ForeName": "Mahshid", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Protein Research Group, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark."}], "LastName": "Jensen", "ForeName": "Pia", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Protein Research Group, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark."}], "LastName": "Nawrocki", "ForeName": "Arkadiusz", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7545-2488"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran 1983963113, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rezadoost", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Integrative Oncology Department, Breast Cancer Research Center, Moatamed Cancer Institute, ACECR, Tehran 1517964311, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ansari", "ForeName": "Alireza Madjid", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Integrative Oncology Department, Breast Cancer Research Center, Moatamed Cancer Institute, ACECR, Tehran 1517964311, Iran."}], "LastName": "Farahmand", "ForeName": "Leila", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6435-9915"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran 1983963113, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghassempour", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6203-0123"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Protein Research Group, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark."}], "LastName": "Larsen", "ForeName": "Martin R", "Initials": "MR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Proteome Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101128775", "ISSNLinking": "1535-3893"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "4393FR07EA", "NameOfSubstance": "safranal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36173113", "10.1021/acs.jproteome.2c00168"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
