Rosmarinic acid (RA) has shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. This investigation assessed the cardioprotective effect of RA on DOX-induced-toxicity in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Male rats were randomized on 7 groups: (1) control, (2) DOX (2\u2009mg/kg, per 48\u2009h, 12d, i.p), (3) RA (40\u2009mg/kg, 12d, i.p.), (4-6) RA (10, 20, 40\u2009mg/kg, 16d, i.p.)+ DOX, (7) Vitamin E (200\u2009mg/kg, per 48\u2009h, 16d, i.p.) + DOX and then indices of cardiac function were estimated. Also, DOX and rosmarinic acid effects were examined on MCF7 cells (breast cancer cells line) to clarify that both cardiotoxicity and anticancer effects were analyzed. DOX increased heart to body weight ratio, RRI, QA, STI, QRS duration and voltage, attenuated HR, blood pressure, Max dP/dt, Min dP/dt, LVDP, enhanced MDA, declined GSH amount, and caused fibrosis and necrosis in cardiac tissue. Administration of RA ameliorated the toxic effects of DOX. In vitro studies showed that RA did not affect the cytotoxic effect of DOX. RA as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cardioprotective compound could be a promising compound to help minimize DOX-induced cardiotoxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5491-572X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rahbardar", "ForeName": "Mahboobeh Ghasemzadeh", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacodynamics and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Eisvand", "ForeName": "Farhad", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rameshrad", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacodynamics and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Targeted Drug Delivery Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Razavi", "ForeName": "Bibi Marjan", "Initials": "BM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7755-2204"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacodynamics and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseinzadeh", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nutr Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "7905040", "ISSNLinking": "0163-5581"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cinnamates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Depsides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "80168379AG", "NameOfSubstance": "Doxorubicin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiotoxicity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamates"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Depsides"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Doxorubicin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rosmarinic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "41"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34085575", "10.1080/01635581.2021.1931362"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
