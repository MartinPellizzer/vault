With the overall desirability (OD) of Icariin content and the dry extract yield in medicinal materials extract concentrate as examining indexes, immersion time, material liquid ratio, extraction time and stress concentration temperature were investigated. Based on the single factor tests, material liquid ratio, extraction time and stress concentration temperature which impacted response values significantly were investigated by three factors and five levels of central composite design.", "Optimum extraction technology of Fufang Bajitian Shenggu Particles were as follows: material liquid ratio was 1:11.33, extraction time was 39 min, and stress concentration temperature was 66 \u00b0C.
