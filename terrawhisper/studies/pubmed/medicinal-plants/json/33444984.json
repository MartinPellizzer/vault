The structures of new compounds were respectively determined as 19-amino-19-dehydroxy 5-epi-\u03b1-cyclopiazonic acid (1), 2-hydroxymethyl-5-(3-oxobutan-2-yl)aminopyran-4(4H)-one (2) and 4-amino-2-hydroxymethylpyridin-5-ol (3) by spectroscopic analysis, ECD calculation and X-ray single crystal diffraction. Compounds 1 and 4 with 19-enamine were dynamic equilibrium of Z- and E- isomers in the solution but favored in Z- isomers in the solid state, while compound 7 with 19-enol was favored in Z- isomer in the solution but a mixture of Z- and E- isomers in solid state. This phenomenon could be explained by the quantum-mechanical energies calculations. Among the isolated compounds 1-7, compounds 1, 4 and 7 with a rare 1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1-azaacenaphtho[3,4-c]pyrrolizidine skeleton showed \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity with the IC<sub>50</sub> values of 41.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.97, 232.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.45 and 243.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.36\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively, and the binding modes were performed by silico docking studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
