From June to September 2021, severe leaf spot disease was observed on 3 tree peony cultivars ('Luoyanghong', 'Moyushenghui', 'Roufurong') in Xinxiang (35\u00ba29\u00b4N, 113\u00ba95\u00b4E) and Luoyang (34\u00ba64\u00b4N, 112\u00ba49\u00b4E), Henan Province, China. Leaf spot incidence was as high as 28% ('Luoyanghong'), 45% ('Moyushenghui') and 67% ('Roufurong'), respectively. Symptoms appeared initially as small purple spots less than 1 mm in diameter in the middle and upper parts of the leaves, and then evolved to coalescent lesions, causing brown scorch ultimately. From each cultivar, 5 diseased leaves were collected. Leaflet tissues (3-4 mm2) cut from spot margins were surface sterilized in 75% alcohol for 45 s, washed 5 times with sterile distilled water, and then cultivated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium at 28 \u00b0C in the dark. Eleven isolates were obtained, and colonies grown from single conidia on PDA were 80-85 mm in diameter after 10 d, with scattered small, dark-based spikes on the surface of the colonies. The aerial mycelium was cottony, dense, and dark gray near the center on the reverse side. Conidia were cylindrical to clavate, with rounded apex and rounded base, and the conidia contents were granular, 8.44-14.06\u00d73.60-4.31 \u03bcm (mean=11.28\u00d73.69 \u03bcm, n=40). Appressoria were mostly subglobose or with a few broad lobes, pale to medium brown, 3.36-6.72\u00d73.35-5.60 \u03bcm (mean=5.02\u00d74.55 \u03bcm, n=20). Based on the culture representation and conidial morphology, the isolates were characterized as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al. 2012; Fu et al. 2019). To further identity the species, the actin (ACT), calmodulin (CAL), chitin synthase (CHS-1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and the ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS) loci of isolates PSW0002, PSW0008 and PSW0009 were amplified using ACT-512F/ACT-783R, CL1C/CL2C, CHS-79F/CHS-345R, GDF/GDR, and ITS1/ITS4, primers (Weir et al. 2012; Schena et al; 2014; Kim et al. 2021; Li et al. 2021). Fifteen sequences were deposited in GenBank (ACT for OP225605, OP225606, and OP225607, CAL for OP225608, OP225609 and OP225610, CHS for OP225611, OP225612 and OP225613, GAPDH for ON321897, OP225614, and OP225615, and ITS for ON323473, OP214349 and OP214350 ), which showed 100% sequence similarity to Colletotrichum aenigma (JX009443 and JX009519 for ACT, JX009683 and JX009684 for CAL, JX009774 and JX009903 for CHS-1, JX010244 and JX009913 for GAPDH, JX010243 and JX010148 for ITS). Three isolates clustered with C. aenigma (ex-holotype culture ICMP 18608) in the multi-locus phylogenetic tree with a bootstrap value of 100%. To achieve Koch's postulates, pathogenicity was tested on 5-year-old healthy potted plants ('Luoyanghong'). Thirty leaves were inoculated with 10 \u00b5L conidial suspension (isolate PSW0002, 1\u00d7106 conidia/mL) and the controls were inoculated with sterile water. Plants were placed in a greenhouse at 28\u00b0C under conditions with 12 h photoperiod and 90% relative humidity. After 5 to 10 days, distinct spots were observed on the inoculated leaves, while the control leaves showed no symptoms. C. aenigma was reisolated from all inoculated leaves, but not from the control. C. aenigma has been reported to cause anthracnose on Pyrus pyrifolia (Weir et al. 2012), Camellia sasanqua (Chen et al. 2019), Juglans regia (Wang et al. 2020), Paeonia ostii (Ren et al. 2020), and Capsicum annuum (Sharma et al. 2022). A previous study reported C. gloeosporioides as a pathogen of anthracnose in tree peonies in China (Xuan et al. 2017), the typical symptoms were big necrotic lesions (5-10 mm diam) on leaves\uff0cwhich were significantly different from those caused by C. aenigma. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. aenigma causing anthracnose in tree peonies in China. This finding may help to take effective control of anthracnose in tree peonies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Institute of Science and Technology, Postdoctoral Research Base, Xinxiang, Henan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; yanliwang0218@yeah.net."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yanli", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Institute of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, Henan, China; ylxyky@126.com."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Wenqing", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Institute of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, Henan, China; 304292476@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Xiaopei", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Institute of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, Henan, China; mizr@hist.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Mi", "ForeName": "Zhaorong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Luoyang Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Science, Luoyang, Henan, China; 1078070473@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Erqiang", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China; halley0729@163.com."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Guanhong", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Luoyang International Peony Garden, Luoyang, China; 2405361010@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Sanni", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Luoyang Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Science, Luoyang, Henan, China; wxhnky@126.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiaohui", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; kzxy303@163.com."}], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Dezheng", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Institute of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, Henan, China; hsl213@yeah.net."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Songlin", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36131500", "10.1094/PDIS-08-22-1916-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
