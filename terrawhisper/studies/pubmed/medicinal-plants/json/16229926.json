The proteins were demonstrated as non-glycoproteins, with molecular mass of 18 and 13 kDa, respectively, comprising of peptide subunits from 6.5 to 9 kDa in the forms of heterodimer and homodimer. All of them have similar N-terminal amino acid sequences with only minor variations and are matched to non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) of the other plants such as wheat LTP using NCBI Blast searching for short, nearly exact matches. Furthermore, they explicated each other as isoforms originated putatively from a multigene family with various molecular weight, binding affinity, ionic strength, and subunits. However, the potencies for antiproliferation of HL-60 cell line and inhibition of the growth of the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa are different in that those of the fetuin-binding protein are greater than non-fetuin binding proteins. The non-specific lipid transfer proteins of P. amaryllifolius exhibit weak to moderate hemagglutinating activity toward rabbit erythrocytes, but, this activity could not be reversed by mannose. They thus could be easily differentiated from the previously reported mannose-binding lectin isolated from this plant, which has subunits with similar molecular weight."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ooi", "ForeName": "Linda S M", "Initials": "LS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "Elaine Y L", "Initials": "EY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Samuel S M", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ooi", "ForeName": "Vincent E C", "Initials": "VE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Peptides", "NlmUniqueID": "8008690", "ISSNLinking": "0196-9781"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carrier Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "lipid transfer proteins, plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Carrier Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HL-60 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pandanaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16229926", "10.1016/j.peptides.2005.08.019", "S0196-9781(05)00403-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
