One important factor is the binding of test chemicals to soil, which is affected by the age of the contamination and soil type. The present study investigated the effect of contamination age by introducing an aging period of 1 to 12 weeks between mixing the test substance, copper sulfate, in with soil and introducing the test plant, Fallopia convolvulus (L.) A. L\u00f6ve. Copper accumulation, emergence of cotyledons, and growth were assessed and related to total (boiling with HNO(3)) and 0.01 M CaCl(2)- and DTPA-extractable soil copper concentrations. Aging of the copper-contaminated soil had only small effects on bioaccumulation of copper, copper toxicity, and extractable soil copper fractions. Soil copper had no effect on emergence of cotyledons. Estimated EC(50) values for shoot and root growth averaged 280 mg Cu/kg. Effects on growth in these laboratory-treated soils were much more severe than in a study performed in soil from an old copper-contaminated field site. Neither CaCl(2)- nor DTPA-extractable copper fractions could explain all of the differences in effects between aged spiked soil and field soil. The accumulation pattern for roots and shoots of F. convolvulus indicated that excessive copper was accumulated and adsorbed mainly by the fine roots, whereby the copper concentrations of other plant parts were kept low until the plant was no longer able to maintain this regulation. An internal threshold for effects on growth of about 20 mg Cu/kg shoot dry weight was estimated, coinciding with a soil copper concentration of approximately 200 mg/kg."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Environmental Research Institute, Department of Terrestrial Ecology, Vejlsovej 25, PO Box 314, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pedersen", "ForeName": "M B", "Initials": "MB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kjaer", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elmegaard", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Environ Contam Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "0357245", "ISSNLinking": "0090-4341"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Cotyledon"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11031302", "10.1007/s002440010124", "10.1007/s002440010124"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
