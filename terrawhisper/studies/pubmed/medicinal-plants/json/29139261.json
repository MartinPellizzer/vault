In this paper, taking Sichuan province as an example, based on TM image, digital elevation model (DEM), meteorology, soil and other data, and using remote sensing and GIS technology to extract grassland, elevation, temperature and precipitation, soil and other influencing factors, the spatial distribution of the suitability of safflower was studied, and the field investigation was carried out. The results indicate that Sichuan safflower resources are mainly concentrated in the eastern and northeastern parts of Sichuan, and the suitable distribution area is about 6 277.14 km2. The area of suitable area of Dazhou is 1 143.45 km\u00b2, which is suitable for the province area of 18.22%. From the county point of view, the suitable area of Dachuan is about 507.15 km\u00b2, and accounting for 17.9% of county. In addition, Naxi, Qingshen, Jiangan and other 12 counties of the suitable area of more than 100 km\u00b2, and accounted for more than 10% of the county. The results of remote sensing and GIS analysis are in accordance with the real area of Sichuan safflower resources. It is feasible to find out the area suitable for the growth of Sichuan safflower by 3S technologies. It can provide a scientific basis for the monitoring and development of Chinese herbal resources."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Institute Geography and Resources Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610068, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Land Resources Evaluation and Monitoring in Southwest, Ministry of Education, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610068, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Wu-Xue", "Initials": "WX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Institute Geography and Resources Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610068, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Land Resources Evaluation and Monitoring in Southwest, Ministry of Education, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610068, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Guang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Institute Geography and Resources Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610068, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Land Resources Evaluation and Monitoring in Southwest, Ministry of Education, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610068, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ming-Yan", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Institute Geography and Resources Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610068, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Land Resources Evaluation and Monitoring in Southwest, Ministry of Education, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610068, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Lan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Institute Geography and Resources Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610068, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Land Resources Evaluation and Monitoring in Southwest, Ministry of Education, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610068, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jia-Li", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Carthamus tinctorius"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geographic Information Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Telemetry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29139261", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170714.020"]}}]}
