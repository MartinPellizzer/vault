The planting area of <i>D. opposita</i> is near 500,000 hectares in China, mainly in Shangdong, Hebei, Henan, Jiangxi and Yunnan provinces. In August 2021, we observed that some <i>D. opposita</i> plants grew poorly with smaller and chlorotic leaves in Changyuan (35\u00b08'12\"N; 114\u00b043'52\"E), Henan Province, China. Galls with hook-shaped roots and tuber damage were also observed, typical of root-knot nematode. Thirty tubers were randomly collected and 60% were infested with root-knot nematodes. During a disease survey in Changyuan, the incidences of root-knot nematode damage were 31.5%, 21%, and 18% in three fields (0.33, 0.67, and 4 ha, respectively) at harvest. The average tuber length of infected plants was decreased by 65.8%, and the average weight was decreased by 70.1% compared to the healthy plants. Males, females, second-stage juveniles (J2s), and eggs were extracted from individual diseased tubers from the three fields for morphological identification. Females were white, pear-shaped with a projecting neck. Males showed a trapezoidal labial region with prominent stylet knobs, including a high head cap which had a stepped outline and was centrally concave in lateral view. Morphological measurements are described in the supplementary material. All data and descriptions conformed to the morphological characteristics of <i>Meloidogyne incognita</i>. Genomic DNA was extracted from J2s (n=9) using PCR lysis buffer, and used for PCR amplification of the sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers specific for <i>M. incognita</i>. Two pairs of the SCAR primers, Mi-F/Mi-R, and Inc-K14-F/Inc-K14-R, were used to diagnose whether these nematodes from <i>D. opposita</i> were <i>M. incognita</i> (Meng et al. 2004; Randig et al. 2002). The PCR produced expected amplification products of 955 and 399 bp, confirming the nematode to be <i>M. incognita</i>. Primers specific for <i>M. arenaria</i> (Far/Rar) and <i>M. javanica</i> (Fjav/Rjav) were used but failed to amplify fragments (Randig et al. 2002; Zijlstra et al. 2000). The obtained PCR fragments were sequenced and deposited in GenBank (accession no. OQ420602.1, OQ427638.1). They showed 99.9 and 100% identity to the available GenBank <i>M. incognita</i> sequence (accession no. MK410954.1, ON861825.1), respectively. A pathogenicity test was conducted in greenhouse conditions. Bulbils of <i>D. opposita</i> were sown in the pots filled with 2,000 ml of autoclaved soil mixture (loamy soil/sand, 1:1). One month later, 15 seedlings (five to six leaf stage) were inoculated with 1,000 <i>M. incognita</i> J2s individually. Five plants without nematode inoculation were used as the control. Two months after inoculation, all of the inoculated roots had galling symptoms similar to those observed in the field, and 100% of root system tissues had galls. The root gall index was ~6 according to a 0 to 10 RKN damage rating scale (Poudyal et al. 2005). No symptoms were found on the control plants. The nematodes were reisolated from root tissue and identified. <i>M. incognita</i> has a broad host range in many species of economic importance including <i>Salvia miltiorrhiza</i> (Wen et al. 2023), <i>Ipomoea batatas</i> (Maleita et al. 2022), and <i>Zea mays</i> (L\u00f3pez-Robles et al. 2013). So far, <i>M. incognita</i> has been reported in <i>D. alata</i> and <i>D. rotundata</i> in Africa (Onkendi et al. 2014). To our best knowledge, this is the first record of <i>M. incognita</i> on <i>D. opposita</i> in Henan Province, China. With the increased planting area of <i>D. opposita</i> in China, root-knot nematodes are becoming more serious and reducing tuber production, with yield losses more than 60%. This identification is a preliminary step in developing effective disease management schemes. Declaration of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.
