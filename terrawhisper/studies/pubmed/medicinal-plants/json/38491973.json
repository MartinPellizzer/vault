The results of the biological activity assays showed that compound <b>9</b> exhibited broad spectrum antifungal activities against all tested fungi <i>in vitro</i> and a significant inhibitory effect on <i>Phytophthora nicotianae</i> with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 3.00 \u03bcg/mL. Notably, compound <b>9</b> demonstrated greater curative and protective effects against tobacco balack shank than those of osthol <i>in vivo</i>. Thus, <b>9</b> was structurally modified to obtain new promising antifungal agents, and the novel derivatives (<b>17b</b>, <b>17j</b>, and <b>17k</b>) exhibited better effects on <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> than did lead compound <b>9</b>. Preliminary mechanistic exploration illustrated that <b>9</b> could enhance cell membrane permeability, destroy the morphology and ultrastructure of cells, and reduce the exopolysaccharide content of <i>P. nicotianae</i> mycelia. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity results revealed that compound <b>9</b> exhibited relatively low cytotoxicity against HEK293 cell lines with an inhibition rate of 33.54% at 30 \u03bcg/mL. This research is promising for the discovery of new fungicides from natural coumarins with satisfactory ecological compatibility."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
