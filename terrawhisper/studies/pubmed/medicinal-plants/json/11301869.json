Manoyl oxide and its isomers, 3 beta-hydroxy-manoyl oxide, 3 beta-hydroxy-13-epi-manoyl oxide, as well as 3 beta-acetoxy-13-epi-manoyl oxide were detected for the first time in C. monspeliensis L. Ent-13-epimanoyl oxide was isolated from the hexane extract of leaves and its structure was determined using spectroscopic methods. In vitro cytotoxic activity of ent-13-epi-manoyl oxide and mixtures of manoyl oxide isomers at 10(-4) M concentrations ranged from 11.1 to 32.2% of the activity for a vinblastine control evaluated against nine leukemic cell lines. The results showed that the manoyl oxide isomer mixtures as well as ent-13-epi-manoyl oxide exhibited a slight growth inhibiting activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Angelopoulou", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Demetzos", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dimas", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Perdetzoglou", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Loukis", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Letter"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ent-13-epi-manoyl oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5V9KLZ54CY", "NameOfSubstance": "Vinblastine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Vinblastine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11301869", "10.1055/s-2001-11497"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
