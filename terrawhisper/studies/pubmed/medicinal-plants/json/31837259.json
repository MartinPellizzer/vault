Previously, the extract of Ruta angustifolia was shown to have potential anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity without any cytotoxicity, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 3.0 \u03bcg/mL and a 50% cytotoxicity concentration of >100 \u03bcg/mL. Furthermore, the combination of medicinal plants and current anti-HCV agents, such as a direct-acting antiviral agent, was shown to potentiate their overall effectiveness. In the course of this study, the ethanolic extract of R. angustifolia was evaluated for its anti-HCV effects; specifically, the mechanism of action on HCV NS3 and NS5A protease was investigated. Methods Analysis of the use of this extract in conjunction with current NS3 inhibitor drugs, simeprevir (SMV) and telaprevir (TVR), was performed. Anti-HCV activity was performed by in vitro culture of hepatocyte cells. The cells were infected and treated with various concentrations of the sample. HCV inhibition was calculated and CompuSyn software analysis was used to determine the synergistic effect of the combination. Results Results demonstrated that R. angustifolia extract inhibited the post-entry step and decreased the protein levels of HCV NS3 and NS5A. The combination of extract and SMV and TVR mediated a synergistic effect. Conclusions These findings suggest that combining R. angustifolia extract with current anti-HCV drugs should be considered when developing alternative and complementary anti-HCV medicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Airlangga University, Surabaya 60115, Indonesia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Tropical Disease, Airlangga University, Surabaya 60115, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Wahyuni", "ForeName": "Tutik Sri", "Initials": "TS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Airlangga University, Surabaya 60115, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Mahfud", "ForeName": "Humairoh", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Tropical Disease, Airlangga University, Surabaya 60115, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Permatasari", "ForeName": "Adita Ayu", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Airlangga University, Surabaya 60115, Indonesia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Tropical Disease, Airlangga University, Surabaya 60115, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Widyawaruyanti", "ForeName": "Aty", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Airlangga University, Surabaya 60115, Indonesia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Tropical Disease, Airlangga University, Surabaya 60115, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Fuad", "ForeName": "Achmad", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9101750", "ISSNLinking": "0792-6855"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NS3 protein, hepatitis C virus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligopeptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Nonstructural Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "655M5O3W0U", "NameOfSubstance": "telaprevir"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9WS5RD66HZ", "NameOfSubstance": "Simeprevir"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.7.48", "NameOfSubstance": "NS-5 protein, hepatitis C virus"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hepacivirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oligopeptides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ruta"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Simeprevir"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Viral Nonstructural Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31837259", "10.1515/jbcpp-2019-0348", "/j/jbcpp.ahead-of-print/jbcpp-2019-0348/jbcpp-2019-0348.xml"]}}]}
