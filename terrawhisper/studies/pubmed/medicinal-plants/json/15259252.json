In the NPIS, the prevalent use of medicinal plants or pharmaceuticals in any community depended on the distance of the community from the nearest village and from a PHC with medical doctor (r = 0.85 and r = -0.96; both P = 0.05. The NPIS communities' knowledge of plants expressed as the average number of medicinal plants mentioned correlated positively and negatively with distance from the nearest village and use of pharmaceuticals, respectively (r= 0.95, P < 0.005 and r = -0.90, P < 0.05, respectively).", "The cultural importance of traditional medicine and the physical isolation of communities, both in general and from PHCs, are factors that influence the use of and knowledge about medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Associate, Ghent University, Laboratory of Tropical and Subtropical Agriculture and Ethnobotany, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium. ivdbroek@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vandebroek", "ForeName": "Ina", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Calewaert", "ForeName": "Jan-Bart", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De jonckheere", "ForeName": "Stijn", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sanca", "ForeName": "Sabino", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Semo", "ForeName": "Lucio", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van Damme", "ForeName": "Patrick", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van Puyvelde", "ForeName": "Luc", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De Kimpe", "ForeName": "Norbert", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Bull World Health Organ", "NlmUniqueID": "7507052", "ISSNLinking": "0042-9686"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bolivia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services Accessibility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Indians, South American"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medically Underserved Area"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Primary Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Self Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Social Isolation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15259252", "PMC2585970"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
