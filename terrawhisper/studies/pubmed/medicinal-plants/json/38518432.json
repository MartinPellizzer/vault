The identification of miRNA molecules in medicinal plants and exploration of their mechanisms not only contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular genetic mechanisms of plant growth, development and resistance to stress, but also provide a theoretical basis for elucidating the pharmacological effects of authentic medicinal materials and constructing bioreactors for the synthesis of medicinal secondary metabolite components. This paper summarizes the research reports on the discovery of miRNA in medicinal plants and their regulatory mechanisms on the synthesis of secondary metabolites by searching the relevant literature in public databases. It summarizes the currently discovered miRNA and their functions in medicinal plants, and summarizes the molecular mechanisms regulating the synthesis and degradation of secondary metabolites. Furthermore, it provides a prospect for the research and development of medicinal plant miRNA. The compiled information contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the research progress on miRNA in medicinal plants and provides a reference for the industrial development of related secondary metabolite biosynthesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS.
