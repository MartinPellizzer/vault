(RC) (Anacardiaceae)] is used as a folk medicine in the treatment of diabetes in Turkey. Objective This study investigates the in vivo healing and protective effects of lyophilized extract sumac against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic complications. Materials and methods Toxicity test was conducted in three different dosages (250, 500 and 1000\u2009mg/kg of plant extracts, respectively). Six groups of seven rats each were used in experiments. Groups were designed as Normal control, Diabetic (DM), DM\u2009+\u2009AC-20\u2009mg/kg, DM\u2009+\u2009Extract-100\u2009mg/kg, DM\u2009+\u2009Extract 250\u2009mg/kg and DM\u2009+\u2009Extract 500\u2009mg/kg group. Experimental diabetes [50\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)] was induced by STZ. The effects of oral administration of the extract for 21 d on the level of serum glucose, insulin, C-peptide, lipid profile (LP), hepatic and renal damage biomarkers (HRDB), diabetic serum biomarkers (DSB), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), antioxidant defence system constituents (ADSCs), malondialdehyde (MDA) and \u03b1-glucosidase activity in small intestine tissue were evaluated. Results The extract decreased the levels of blood glucose in diabetic groups (an average of 31%). Triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein levels were balanced by plant extract (500\u2009mg/kg) supplementation in the diabetic group. Decreased levels of aspartate aminotransferase (89%), alanine aminotransferase (91%), lactate dehydrogenase (35%), alkaline phosphatase (47%), creatinine (25%) and urea (29%) were detected in plant extract (500\u2009mg/kg) supplemented diabetic group. Additionally, a considerable increase in the HRDB, DSB, LP, MDA and fluctuated ADSC levels were restored in RC-extract supplemented groups. Conclusion RC lyophilized extract has a healing effect on diabetes and diabetes-related complications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Faculty of Science, Department of Biology , Yuzuncu Yil University , Van , Turkey ;"}], "LastName": "Do\u011fan", "ForeName": "Abdulahad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Faculty of Science, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics , Yuzuncu Yil University , Van , Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00c7elik", "ForeName": "\u0130smail", "Initials": "\u0130"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812552", "ISSNLinking": "1388-0209"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycated Hemoglobin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Complications"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycated Hemoglobin"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intestine, Small"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26957014", "10.3109/13880209.2016.1145702"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
