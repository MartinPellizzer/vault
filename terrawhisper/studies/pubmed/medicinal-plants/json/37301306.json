Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAM), as part of indigenous and pluralistic medical systems, are important contributors to primary health care worldwide. However, this knowledge remains relatively undocumented in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa such as the Tutume subdistrict of Central Botswana, where CAM is widely used including potentially for HIV/AIDS and HIV-associated conditions.", "To explore the extent to which CAM is used by the BaKalanga Peoples of the Tutume subdistrict, we performed an exploratory community-based project to record medicinal plant use from this relatively undocumented region, with a particular focus on species used for management of HIV/AIDS and HIV-associated conditions.", "Using the snowball sampling technique, we recruited 13 Traditional Health Practitioners (THPs) and conducted in-depth interviews to explore medicinal plant uses and treatment regimens. Plant specimens were collected and bio-authenticated.", "We documented 83 plant species used as CAM to treat or manage a variety of conditions including HIV/AIDS, HIV-associated conditions, and other health conditions. Plants from the family Leguminosae were most frequently reported, comprising 21 species (25.3%), followed by 5 from both Euphorbiaceae and Combretaceae families (6.0%). Four plants (4.8%) were used specifically to manage HIV (Lannea edulis (Sond.) Engl. root, Aloe zebrina Baker root, Myrothamnus flabellifolia Welw. whole plant, and Harpagophytum procumbens var. subulobatum (Engl.) tuber), while an additional 7 (8.4%) were reported specifically for treating combinations of HIV-related symptoms. Notably, 25 (30.1%) have not been reported previously as CAM and/or lack reported bioactivity data.", "To our knowledge, this is the first detailed ethnobotanical survey of CAM used by the BaKalanga Peoples of the Tutume subdistrict to manage HIV/AIDS and HIV-associated and other health conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
