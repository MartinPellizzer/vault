A fixed combination of three plant substances (Phytolacca americana, Guajacum officinale, Capsicum annuum) was used in either solid (tablet) or liquid (drop) formulation: 107 patients were treated and no antibiotics were used. The objective and subjective symptoms of acute tonsillitis were noted. A significant decrease in symptoms was observed as early as 2.5 days after treatment startup; no serious adverse effects were reported. It was concluded that acute tonsillitis can be treated with a homeopathic remedy characterized by its immunomodulatory, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wiesenauer", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Adv Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "8611864", "ISSNLinking": "0741-238X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tablets"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Homeopathy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tablets"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Tonsillitis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10351119", "155"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
