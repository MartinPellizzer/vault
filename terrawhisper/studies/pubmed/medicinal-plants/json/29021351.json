Our early studies demonstrated that CYP3A catalyzed the biotransformation of BBR to epoxide intermediate(s) that reacted with sulfur nucleophiles of protein to form protein covalent binding both in vitro and in vivo. The present study attempted to define the correlation between metabolic epoxidation and hepatotoxicity of BBR by manipulating the structure of BBR. We rationally designed and synthesized three halogenated BBR derivatives, fluorinated BBR (6-F-BBR), chlorinated BBR (6-Cl-BBR), and brominated BBR (6-Br-BBR), to decrease the potential for cytochrome P450-mediated metabolic activation. Both in vitro and in vivo uricosuric activity assays showed that 6-F-BBR achieved favorable uricosuric effect, while 6-Cl-BBR and 6-Br-BBR showed weak uricosuric efficacy. Additionally, 6-F-BBR elicited much lower hepatotoxicity in mice. Fluorination of BBR offered advantage to metabolic stability in liver microsomes, almost completely blocked the formation of epoxide metabolite(s) and protein covalent binding, and attenuated hepatic and plasma glutathione depletion. Moreover, the structural manipulation did not alter the efficacy of BBR. This work provided solid evidence that the formation of the epoxide(s) is a key step in the development of BBR-induced hepatotoxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation (H.W., Y.P., H.Z., Y.Z., X.W., J.Z.) and Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drug Design and Discovery (Ministry of Education) (W.W., S.W.), School of Pharmaceutical Engineering, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, P.R.
