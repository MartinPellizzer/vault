Considering the evidence that this species has anti-inflammatory effects, the present study aims to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of VLN in vivo and in silico. Swiss mice (n\u00a0=\u00a06) were orally treated according to their treatment groups as follows: VLN (10, 100 or 300\u00a0mg/kg), negative control (0.9% saline), and positive controls (indomethacin 25\u00a0mg/kg or promethazine 6\u00a0mg/kg). The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in murine models of acute and chronic inflammation. The inhibition of acute inflammation was evaluated in models of paw edema induced by different inflammatory agents (carrageenan, dextran, histamine, and arachidonic acid (AA)) and carrageenan-induced pleurisy and peritonitis. The modulation of chronic inflammation was evaluated in a granuloma model induced cotton pellets implantation. The interaction with inflammatory targets was evaluated in silico using molecular docking analysis. The administration of VLN to challenged mice significantly inhibited paw edema formation with no significant difference between the administered doses. The compound also reduced albumin extravasation, leukocyte recruitment, and the production of myeloperoxidase (MPO), IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 in both pleural and peritoneal lavages. According to the mathematical-statistical model observed in silico analysis, this compound has favorable energy to interact with the cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2) and the histamine 1 (H1) receptor. Finally, animals treated with the sesquiterpene showed a reduction in both granuloma weight and concentration of total proteins in a chronic inflammation model. Given these findings, it is concluded that NLV presents promising pharmacological activity in murine models of acute and chronic inflammation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
