Natural products have been extensively utilized in treating NAFLD because of their distinctive advantages over chemotherapeutic drugs, despite the fact that there are no approved drugs for therapy. Notably, the limitations of many natural products, such as poor water solubility, low bioavailability <i>in vivo</i>, low hepatic distribution, and lack of targeted effects, have severely restricted their clinical application. These issues could be resolved <i>via</i> hepatic targeted drug delivery systems (HTDDS) that boost clinical efficacy in treating NAFLD and decrease the adverse effects on other organs. Herein an overview of natural products comprising formulas, single medicinal plants, and their crude extracts has been presented to treat NAFLD. Also, the clinical efficacy and molecular mechanism of active monomer compounds against NAFLD are systematically discussed. The targeted delivery of natural products <i>via</i> HTDDS has been explored to provide a different nanotechnology-based NAFLD treatment strategy and to make suggestions for natural-product-based targeted nanocarrier design. Finally, the challenges and opportunities put forth by the nomenclature update of NAFLD are outlined along with insights into how to improve the NAFLD therapy and how to design more rigorous nanocarriers for the HTDDS. In brief, we summarize the up-to-date developments of the NAFLD-HTDDS based on natural products and provide viewpoints for the establishment of more stringent anti-NAFLD natural-product-targeted nanoformulations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7605-0379"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing City Key Laboratory of Drug Delivery Technology and Novel Formulation, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &amp;
