Hair mineral and trace element analysis was performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The obtained data demonstrate that hair levels of Mg, P, I, Cr, Si, Zn, and Pb in Down's syndrome patients exceeded the respective control values by 36, 36, 93, 57, 45, 28, and 54%, whereas hair mercury was more than twofold lower in children with Down's syndrome. The observed difference in the levels of trace elements was age-dependent. In particular, in 1-year-olds, major differences were observed for essential elements (Cr, Si, Zn), whereas in 2-year-olds-for toxic elements (Hg, Pb). At the same time, hair P levels in Down's syndrome patients were 14 and 35% higher at the age of 1 and 2\u00a0years in comparison to the respective controls. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that a model incorporating all elements, being characterized by a significant group difference, accounted for 42.5% of status variability. At the same time, only hair phosphorus was significantly interrelated with Down's syndrome status (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.478; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Principal component analysis (PCA) used As, Ca, Cr, Fe, Hg, I, Mg, P, Pb, Se, Si, Sn, and Zn as predictors, with the resulting R<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.559. The OPLS-DA models also separated between Down's and health control groups. Therefore, 1-2-year-old patients with Down's syndrome are characterized by significant alterations of mineral and trace element status."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yaroslavl State University, Yaroslavl, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Peoples' Friendship University of Russia (RUDN University), Moscow, Russian Federation."}], "LastName": "Grabeklis", "ForeName": "Andrey R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yaroslavl State University, Yaroslavl, Russia. skalny3@microelements.ru."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Peoples' Friendship University of Russia (RUDN University), Moscow, Russian Federation. skalny3@microelements.ru."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "All-Russian Research Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (VILAR), Moscow, Russia. skalny3@microelements.ru."}], "LastName": "Skalny", "ForeName": "Anatoly V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia."}], "LastName": "Skalnaya", "ForeName": "Anastasia A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Peoples' Friendship University of Russia (RUDN University), Moscow, Russian Federation."}], "LastName": "Zhegalova", "ForeName": "Irina V", "Initials": "IV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orenburg State University, Orenburg, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Research Centre of Biological Systems and Agro-technologies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Orenburg, Russia."}], "LastName": "Notova", "ForeName": "Svetlana V", "Initials": "SV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yaroslavl State University, Yaroslavl, Russia."}], "LastName": "Mazaletskaya", "ForeName": "Anna L", "Initials": "AL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yaroslavl State University, Yaroslavl, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Peoples' Friendship University of Russia (RUDN University), Moscow, Russian Federation."}], "LastName": "Skalnaya", "ForeName": "Margarita G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yaroslavl State University, Yaroslavl, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Peoples' Friendship University of Russia (RUDN University), Moscow, Russian Federation."}], "LastName": "Tinkov", "ForeName": "Alexey A", "Initials": "AA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "18-013-01026", "Agency": "Russian Foundation for Basic Research", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biol Trace Elem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7911509", "ISSNLinking": "0163-4984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Down Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hair"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30209729", "10.1007/s12011-018-1506-8", "10.1007/s12011-018-1506-8"]}}]}
