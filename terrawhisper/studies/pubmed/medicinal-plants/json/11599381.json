The stock segments taken in the period of rapid growth of the plant were suitable for tissue culture. The induction rate of callus from the stock segments was as high as 21.9% and easy to differentiate micro-stock and plantlets, which may result from an activate function of stock cambium to enhance cell division during the stage of sprouting to rapid growth.", "The tissue culture method is a practicable and potential biotechnological way to multiply Trillium tsehonoskii plants. One key point to establish an in vitro system is to further improve the plantlet differentiation rate of the callus induced."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Liliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11599381"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
