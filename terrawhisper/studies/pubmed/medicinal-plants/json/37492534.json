Previous studies have shown that <i>R. angustifolia</i> leaves can inhibit the hepatitis C virus in Huhit culture cells, reduce the value of NS3 protein, and possess a synergistic effect in combination with antiviral drugs. Therefore, this plant is potential to be developed as a drug candidate. Characteristics of plants including microscopic, physicochemical properties, and phytochemical profiles are necessary information to ensure the quality of raw material in drug development.", "This study was carried out to examine the microscopic and physicochemical including the standardized parameter of <i>R. angustifolia</i> leaves to fulfil the quality raw materials as traditional medicine.", "Simplicia of <i>R. angustifolia</i> leaves obtained from Jombang, East Java, were observed <b>under</b> a microscope and determined its physicochemical properties referred to the Materia Medica Indonesia V.
