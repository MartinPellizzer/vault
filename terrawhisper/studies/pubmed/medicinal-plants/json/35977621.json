The synthesis of CuNPs was performed using the leaves of T. subulata (TS-CuNPs) and characterized using UV-visible spectrophotometry, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Produced TS-CuNPs showing transmittance peaks approximately 707-878\u00a0cm<sup>-1</sup>, with a spherical shape particle with an average size of 58.5\u00a0nm. As synthesized TS-CuNPs were used as a coating material in cotton fabrics and tested the efficacy against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. TS-CuNPs inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus on cotton fabrics. Antibiofilm activity of TS-CuNPs showed a 4-fold reduction in the biofilm formation of E. coli and S. aureus. Structural morphology of TS-CuNPs coated on cotton fabric analysis using SEM-EDX confirmed the attachment of TS-CuNPs and reduction in the bacterial attachment to the cotton fabrics. Thus, this study provides a potential strategy to improve the antibacterial property of cotton fabrics in textile production for medical, sportswear, and casual wear applications. Further, the photocatalytic activity against the tested dyes evident the potential in dye industry wastewater treatment. Hence, this work represents a simple, greener, and cost-effective route for in situ synthesis of CuNPs with the potential antibacterial and as a dye degradation agent for water remediation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
