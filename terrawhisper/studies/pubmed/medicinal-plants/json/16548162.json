The pollen surface of all populations sticks out with spines, varying in size and density, the base and top part of spinules was different among populations. The pollen grains patterns of germination apertures of P. ternata was likely to have colpate cover."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Nanjing Agricultural University, China. gqs@herbstimes.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Qiao-sheng", "Initials": "QS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qing-ya", "Initials": "QY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Hong-zhuan", "Initials": "HZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Pinellia"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16548162"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
