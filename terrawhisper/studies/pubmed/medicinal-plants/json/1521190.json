Nodule occupancy was determined with strain-specific fluorescent antibodies. The strains were divided into three groups according to their overall competitive abilities on pole bean cv. Kentucky Wonder and bush bean cv. Bountiful. Strains TAL 182 and TAL 1472 were highly competitive (greater than 70% nodule occupancy); strains KIM-5, Viking 1, and CIAT 899 were moderately competitive (approximately 50% nodule occupancy); and strain CIAT 632 was poorly competitive (less than 5% nodule occupancy). The competitiveness of the six strains was similar on the two host cultivars. The proportion of competing strains in the inoculum influenced the nodule occupancy of the highly competitive and moderately competitive strains, but not that of the poorly competitive strain. Two outstanding strains (TAL 182 and TAL 1472) were identified as ideal model strains for molecular and genetic studies on nodulation competitiveness."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Hawaii, Honolulu 96822."}], "LastName": "George", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Robert", "ForeName": "F M", "Initials": "FM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372707", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4166"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Fixation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium leguminosarum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Symbiosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1521190", "10.1139/m92-026"]}}]}
