The dysregulation of the apoptotic pathway or programmed cell death, governed by the Bcl-2 family of proteins plays a crucial role in cancer development and progression. Bcl-B stands out as a unique anti-apoptotic protein from the Bcl-2 family that selectively binds to Bax which inhibits its pro-apoptotic function. Although several inhibitors are reported for Bcl-2 family proteins, no specific inhibitors are available against the anti-apoptotic Bcl-B protein. This study aims to address this research gap by using virtual screening of an in-house library of phytochemicals from seven anti-cancer medicinal plants to identify lead molecules against Bcl-B protein. Through pharmacokinetic analysis and molecular docking studies, we identified three lead candidates (Enterolactone, Piperine, and Protopine) based on appreciable drug-likeliness, ADME properties, and binding affinity values. The identified molecules also exhibited specific interactions with critical amino acid residues of the binding cleft, highlighting their potential as lead candidates. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations and MM/PBSA based binding free energy analysis revealed that Enterolactone (CID_114739) and Piperine (CID_638024) molecules were on par with Obatoclax (CID_11404337), which is a known inhibitor of the Bcl-2 family proteins.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
