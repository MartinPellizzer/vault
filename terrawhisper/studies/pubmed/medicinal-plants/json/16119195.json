The extract was also investigated for its radical scavenging activity using DPPH assay. The crude extract was found to possess significant enzyme inhibition activities against jack bean (74%) and Bacillus pasteurii (80%) urease and a moderate activity (54%) against alpha-Chymotrypsin. The extract also displayed excellent (83%) radical scavenging activity. On the basis of these results, the crude extract was subsequently fractionated into n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and water fractions and tested independently for the aforesaid activities. Significant inhibitory activity against urease enzyme was observed for the ethyl acetate, n-butanol and water fractions while the n-hexane and chloroform fractions were devoid of any such activity. In the alpha-Chymotrypsin enzyme inhibition studies the activity was concentrated into the ethyl acetate fraction. All the fractions displayed potent radical scavenging activity. The crude extract and fractions thereof were also subjected to total phenolic content determination. A correlation between radical scavenging capacities of extracts and total phenolic content was observed in the majority of cases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi 75270, Pakistan. taouskhan@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Taous", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Mansoor", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nisar", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Manzoor", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lodhi", "ForeName": "Muhammad Arif", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choudhary", "ForeName": "Muhammad Iqbal", "Initials": "MI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101150203", "ISSNLinking": "1475-6366"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Complex Mixtures"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chymotrypsin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.1", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-chymotrypsin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.5.1.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Urease"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chymotrypsin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Complex Mixtures"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Paeonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Urease"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16119195", "10.1080/14756360400026220"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
