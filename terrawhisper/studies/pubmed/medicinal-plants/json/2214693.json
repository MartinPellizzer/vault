All subjects were interviewed and examined. Audiometric examinations were arranged for those with significant noise exposure. Assessments of dust and noise levels were conducted. Symptoms of upper respiratory tract irritation, such as sneezing and runny nose, during work were experienced by 49.2 per cent of workers. These symptoms were maximal in the first few weeks of employment in spice grinding and did not recur in half of the affected workers. Over 26 per cent of the workers experienced a warm or burning sensation of the skin when grinding chili or pepper. None of the spice grinders had symptoms or evidence on physical examination of allergic skin disease or asthma. Noise-induced hearing loss was detected in 21 per cent of the workers examined but none had severe disabling deafness. Dust levels ranged from 0.03 to 0.82 mg/m3, with a mean value of 0.15 mg/m3. Noise exposure was significant, with levels of between 87 and 98 dBA. Control measures to reduce the noise and dust exposure are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Health, Ministry of Labour, Singapore."}], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "O Y", "Initials": "OY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "C S", "Initials": "CS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "K T", "Initials": "KT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thirumoorthy", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Soc Occup Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7503120", "ISSNLinking": "0301-0023"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dust"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Condiments"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dust"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hearing Loss, Noise-Induced"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protective Devices"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2214693", "10.1093/occmed/40.3.111"]}}]}
