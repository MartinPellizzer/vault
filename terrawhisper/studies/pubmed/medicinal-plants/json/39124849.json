American ginseng is well known as a traditional herb and is commonly used in clinical decoctions. However, the nano-characteristics and chemical composition of American-ginseng-derived vesicle-like nanoparticles (AGVNs) in decoctions are unclear. In this study, the gradient centrifugation method was used to extract and isolate AGVNs. A metabolomic method based on high-resolution mass spectrometry was established to analyze small molecules loaded in AGVNs. Zebrafish and RAW264.7 cells were employed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of AGVNs. The results showed that the particle size of AGVNs was generally 243.6 nm, and the zeta potential was -14.5 mV. AGVNs were found to contain 26 ginsenosides (14 protopanaxadiols, 11 protopanaxatriols, and 1 oleanolic acid). Ginsenoside Rb1 and malonyl-ginsenoside Rb1 tended to be enriched in AGVNs. Moreover, AGVNs were found to exert anti-inflammatory effects by reducing macrophage migration in zebrafish and regulating inflammatory factor (NO, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10) secretion in RAW 264.7 cells. The characterization and analysis of AGVNs provide references and data that support the development of nanoscale anti-inflammatory substances from medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences & Institute of Materia Medica, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250017, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Basic Pharmacology of Ministry of Education, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563006, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Taiping", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences & Institute of Materia Medica, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250017, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences & Institute of Materia Medica, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250017, China."}], "LastName": "Bi", "ForeName": "Wenjie", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences & Institute of Materia Medica, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250017, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Yonghui", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1280-2468"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Basic Pharmacology of Ministry of Education, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563006, China."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Yongai", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences & Institute of Materia Medica, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250017, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Songsong", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences & Institute of Materia Medica, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250017, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40292, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, Beijng 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Liwen", "Initials": "L"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2023103", "Agency": "The project of Key Laboratory of Basic Pharmacology of Ministry of Education, Zunyi Medical University", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2060302", "Agency": "Key Project at the Central Government Level: The ability establishment of sustainable use for valuable Chinese medicine resources", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Molecules", "NlmUniqueID": "100964009", "ISSNLinking": "1420-3049"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RAW 264.7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zebrafish"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39124849", "10.3390/molecules29153443", "molecules29153443"]}}]}
