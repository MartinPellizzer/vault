The ZTO liposomes were prepared by ethanol injection method. To determine the entrapment efficiency of the ZTO liposomes, we passed the liposome suspension through a Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated with PBS. Pharmaceutical characteristics of different liposomes such as size, zata potential, entrapment efficiency, stablility were determined and compared.", "The ZTO liposomes and free drug could be separated completely by the Sephadex G-50 chromatography, and the column recovery was (100.09+/-3.375)% (n=5). The ZTO liposomes composed of hydrogenated soybean phosphatidylcholine (HSPC) possessed the worst entrapment efficiency and sedimentation stability. The entrapment efficiency of the ZTO liposomes composed of soybean phosphatidylcholine (SPC) was equal to that of liposomes composed of both HSPC and SPC. However, The sedimentation and leakage stabilities of the latter were significantly higher than those of SPC liposomes.", "As the carrier of the ZTO liposomes, the composition of both HSPC and SPC can improve its stability."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210046, China. chenjun75@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Na-Na", "Initials": "NN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei-Mei", "Initials": "WM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bian", "ForeName": "Zheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Tu-Lin", "Initials": "TL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mao", "ForeName": "Chun-Qin", "Initials": "CQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Bao-Chang", "Initials": "BC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Carriers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Liposomes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Curcuma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Carriers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogenation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liposomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Technology, Pharmaceutical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19771852"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
