In East Asian countries, various types of herbal medicines have been used to treat cerebrovascular diseases, including SAH. In this review, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of herbal medicines for the prevention and treatment of CVS after SAH.", "Seven databases will be searched for relevant studies from inception to the present date \"June 2020\". Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assess the effect and safety of herbal medicines for the prevention and treatment of CVS after SAH will be included.
