However, its effects on allergic asthma as related to its chemical compositions have not been fully elucidated, and there is a scarcity of methods to determine multi-component contents for quality control. In this study, protective effects of Gerberae Piloselloidis Herba on ovalbumin-induced asthma models were investigated, while qualitative and quantitative analyses of multiple constituents in Gerberae Piloselloidis Herba were conducted by using an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-Q Exactive hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry and an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection. The results showed that Gerberae Piloselloidis Herba could significantly mitigate asthma symptoms, reduce eosinophils counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, as well as decrease IgE, IL-5, and IL-13 concentration, and inflammatory cellular infiltration in lung tissues. A total of 51 compounds were tentatively identified, in which the content of 10 representative compounds was determined in 24 batches of Gerberae Piloselloidis Herba by using an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography method with good linearity, precision, repeatability, accuracy, and stability. This research presents a comprehensive strategy combining biological activity evaluation with chemical profiling, providing a useful and comprehensive reference for further application and quality control of Gerberae Piloselloidis Herba."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8703-7532"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, P.
