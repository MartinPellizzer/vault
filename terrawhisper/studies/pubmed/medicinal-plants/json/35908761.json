The leaves of Crataegus pinnatifida Bge. var major N.E.Br (hawthorn leaves) could be harvested in summer and autumn according to the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China (Pharmacopoeia). However, little is known about the difference of the chemical constituents in hawthorn leaves with the harvest seasonal variations.", "The chemical constituents of hawthorn leaves in different months were comprehensively analysed to determine the best harvest time.", "Initially, the chemical information of the hawthorn leaves were obtained by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS). Subsequently, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to compare the chemical compositions of hawthorn leaves harvested in different months. Then, an absolute quantitation method was established using high-performance liquid chromatography-charged aerosol detector (HPLC-CAD) to determine the contents of five compounds and clarify the changes of these components with the harvest seasonal variations. Meanwhile, a semi-quantitative method by integrating HPLC-CAD with inverse gradient compensation was also established and verified.", "Fifty-eight compounds were identified through UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS. PCA revealed that the harvest season of hawthorn leaves had a significant effect on the chemical compositions. The contents of five components were relatively high in autumn. Other four main components without reference standards were further analysed through the semi-quantitative method, which also showed a high content in autumn.", "This work emphasised the effect of harvest time on the chemical constituents of hawthorn leaves and autumn is recommended to ensure the quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Thermo Fisher Scientific (China), Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Chai", "ForeName": "Rui-Ping", "Initials": "RP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Hai-Zhen", "Initials": "HZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hui", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Thermo Fisher Scientific (China), Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Bao-Lin", "Initials": "BL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0810-0466"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Bai-Ping", "Initials": "BP"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2017ZDCXL-SF-01-02-01", "Agency": "Project of Key Research and Development Plan of Shaanxi", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2017ZDXM-SF-017", "Agency": "The Key Project of Research and Development Plan of Shaanxi", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "IRT_15R55", "Agency": "Programme for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research in University", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "82074008", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochem Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "9200492", "ISSNLinking": "0958-0344"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Crataegus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Newman DJ, Cragg GM.
