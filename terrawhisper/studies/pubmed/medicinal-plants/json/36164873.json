The chemical structures of all isolated compounds were identified in the light of their physicochemical properties, spectroscopic analyses, and comparisons of their physicochemical and spectroscopic data with the reported data in literature. As a result, 20 compounds were isolated and characterized from the 90% ethanol extract of the branches and leaves of A. incisus, which were identified as tephrosin(1), 6-hydroxy-6 a, 12 a-dehydrodeguelin(2), sarcolobin(3), lupiwighteone(4), 12-deoxo-12\u03b1-methoxyelliptone(5), 6 a\u03b1,12 a\u03b1-12 a-hydroxyelliptone(6), homopterocarpin(7), 3-hydroxy-8,9-dimethoxypterocarpan(8), pterocarpin(9), maackiain(10), medicarpin(11), calycosin(12), genistein(13), formononetin(14), 5-hydroxy-4',7-dimethoxy isoflavone(15), liquiritigenin(16), 4(15)-eudesmene-1\u03b2,7\u03b1-diol(17), ent-4(15)-eudesmene-1\u03b2,6\u03b1-diol(18), 1\u03b1-hydroxyisodauc-4-en-15-al(19), and guaianediol(20). Except compounds 13 and 16, all other compounds were isolated from the Artocarpus plants for the first time. Additionally, using MTS assay, compounds 1-20 were eva-luated for their anti-rheumatoid arthritis activities by measuring their anti-proliferative effects on synoviocytes in vitro. As a consequence, compounds 1-16 showed notable anti-rheumatoid arthritis activities, which displayed inhibitory effects on the proliferation of MH7 A synovial fibroblast cells, with the IC_(50) values in range of(9.86\u00b10.09)-(218.07\u00b11.96) \u03bcmol\u00b7L~(-1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resources Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Yu-Tong", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resources Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Shu-Hong", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resources Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Bian", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resources Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resources Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Ruo-Qing", "Initials": "RQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resources Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Suo", "ForeName": "Xin-Yuan", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resources Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "DU", "ForeName": "Meng-Ran", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resources Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Hainan Provincial Engineering Research Center of Key Technology for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plant Resources, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Haikou Key Laboratory of Tropical Fruit and Vegetable Research and Development, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yan-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resources Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Hainan Provincial Engineering Research Center of Key Technology for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plant Resources, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Haikou Key Laboratory of Tropical Fruit and Vegetable Research and Development, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Yan-Hui", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60650-90-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Silica Gel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DH2M523P0H", "NameOfSubstance": "Genistein"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artocarpus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genistein"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silica Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Synoviocytes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "22"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36164873", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220506.203"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
