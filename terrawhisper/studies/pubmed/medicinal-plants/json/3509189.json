Treatments were performed on blastula stage (+/- 15 h after first cleavage) and on adult snails (11-18 mm). In both instances they were exposed for 24 h to different concentrations of the extracts on snails (200 to 2500 ppm) and embryos (20 to 300 ppm) at 25 +/- 1 degree C. The embryos were observed for a period of 20 days after treatment and the snails for 10 days. Results obtained with leaf aqueous extracts have shown a degree of toxicity on embryos starting at a concentration of 125 ppm, the flower extract being effective at 35 ppm. The malformation obtained with the different concentrations falls into the unespecific type category, however some cephalic and shell malformations were found in embryos treated with concentrations over 50 ppm (leaves) and 25 ppm (flowers). The LD90 on adult snails obtained by treatments with flower and leaf extract was observed at concentrations of 340 ppm and 1900 ppm respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Biologia, Instituto de Bioci\u00eancias-USP, Brasil."}], "LastName": "R\u00e9", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kawano", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz", "NlmUniqueID": "7502619", "ISSNLinking": "0074-0276"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "embryology"], "DescriptorName": "Biomphalaria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blastocyst"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3509189", "10.1590/s0074-02761987000800060", "S0074-02761987000800060"]}}]}
