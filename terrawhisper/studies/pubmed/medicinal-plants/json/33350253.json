This plant has been used with a long history as traditional herbal medicine for the treatment of alcoholism and liver protection. Modern pharmacological research shows that the crude extracts or pure compounds from Hovenia have anti-alcoholism, hepatoprotective, anti-hyperuricemia, anti-viral and anti-tumor activities, etc. Previous phytochemical studies have indicated that flavonoids, triterpenoid saponins, phenylpropanoids and polysaccharides are the major constituents in this plant. In this paper, we systematically summarized and analyzed the chemical constituents and pharmacological activities of Hovenia, providing the scientific evidences for the rational use and comprehensive development of Hovenia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Chirality Research on Active Components of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Second Affiliated Hospital,Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Fang-Fang", "ForeName": "X U", "Initials": "XU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Chirality Research on Active Components of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Second Affiliated Hospital,Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Bo", "ForeName": "Liu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center for Modernization of Traditimal Chinese Medicine, Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Natural Products,College of Pharmacy, Ji'nan University Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao-Qi", "ForeName": "Zhang", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33350253", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200706.602"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
