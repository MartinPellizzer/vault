AGIIb-1 mainly consisted of arabinose, galactose, rhamnose and galacturonic acid in a molar ratio of 2.2:1.0:0.3:0.4, and AGIIb-2 mainly consisted of arabinose, galactose, galacturonic acid, and glucuronic acid in a ratio of 1.0:1.0:0.08:0.1. AGIIb-1 was found to form molecular aggregates as the result of self-aggregation in water. The aggregated form was found in the void volume by gel filtration using Sepharose CL-2B in water. However, AGIIb-2 did not show this behavior. When the AGIIb-1 aggregate was applied to a gel filtration column in 8 M urea or NaCl solution, the position of the peak fraction shifted to a lower molecular weight region, and the molecular weight of AGIIb-1 decreased with the increase of NaCl concentration in the gel filtration. These results suggested that the molecular aggregation of AGIIb-1 was caused by hydrogen bonding and ionic interaction and was Ca2+ ion independent. The anti-complementary activity of AGIIb-1 was seen to be dependent upon the degree of molecular aggregation, and the AGIIb-1 aggregate in water showed the highest activity. The results of methylation analysis indicated that AGIIb-1 contained a large amount of 3,5- or 3,4-di-O-substituted arabinosyl residues whereas AGIIb-2 contained a large amount of 6-O-substituted galactopyranosyl residues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kiyohara", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cyong", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Otsuka", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Pharmacobiodyn", "NlmUniqueID": "7901854", "ISSNLinking": "0386-846X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Complement Inactivator Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Galactans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Uronic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SL4SX1O487", "NameOfSubstance": "arabinogalactan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complement Inactivator Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Galactans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Uronic Acids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3735056", "10.1248/bpb1978.9.339"]}}]}
