In a C57BL/6J mouse model for diet induced type 2 diabetes, intervention for 12 weeks using ADHF as a diet supplement resulted in a significant inhibition of diabetes related changes in major organs usually targeted by type 2 diabetes and a significant reduction in circulating levels of glucose and insulin. Young male mice were randomly assigned to receive ad libitum exposure to either a standard rodent chow diet or to a high fat, high simple sugar, low fibre diet (diabetes induction diet), respectively for 8 weeks. All mice fed the induction diet developed abnormally high blood glucose levels at 8 weeks. Animals with confirmed diet induced diabetic blood glucose levels were again randomly assigned into one of three groups (10 subjects per group), one group was thereafter fed only the diabetes induction diet and the other two groups were thereafter fed the diabetes induction diet into which ADHF had been mixed at 4% or at 8% fi nal concentrations. Normal mice were also randomized into two groups that were fed either a regular diet alone or 8% ADHF mixed in the regular diet. Blood glucose levels markedly increased over the 20 weeks of study in the diabetic mice fed the diabetes induction diet only. In contrast, diabetic mice fed induction diet into which 4% or 8% ADHF had been incorporated showed significantly decreased blood glucose and insulin levels over the time of the study. Additional parameters significantly reduced in diabetic mice fed ADHF included insulin resistance and histopathological changes in the pancreas and liver. This is the fi rst report to our knowledge to show in vivo evidence for significantly decreased circulating glucose and insulin levels and a significant reduction of progressive damage to major target organs by the addition of an herbal diet supplement to a diabetes induction diet proven to be capable of causing and maintaining type 2 diabetes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA. wintersw@uthcsa.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Winters", "ForeName": "Wendell D", "Initials": "WD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huo", "ForeName": "Yu Shu", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Da-Lin", "Initials": "DL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12820223", "10.1002/ptr.1079"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
