S. Lo and three populations of S. epigaea H. S. Lo from Yunnan province were evaluated by direct amplification of length polymorphism (DALP) markers. Five primer groups were screened, and a total of 287 DNA fragments were amplified, among which 266 were polymorphic, averaging 53.2 polymorphic bands per primer group in S. yunnanensis. The percentage of polymorphic bands of S. yunnanensis was 92.68% at the species level and 61.92% within the ten populations sampled. At the species level, the observed number of alleles (N (a)) was 1.9268 and the effective number of alleles (N (e)) was 1.5933; Nei's gene diversity (H) was 0.3414; Shannon's information index (I) was 0.5057. At the population level, N (a) = 1.6192, N (e) = 1.4001, H = 0.2298, and I = 0.3401. Total gene diversity of S. yunnanensis was 0.3419. Gene diversity within population was 0.2298, coefficient of gene differentiation was 0.3278, and estimated gene flow was 1.0254. The results indicated that the genetic differentiation was relatively higher among populations of S. yunnanensis. DALP markers were an informative and useful method for assaying genetic diversity and authenticating species of Stephania. These data could provide basic molecular evidence for establishing a reasonable strategy for protecting and exploiting the resource of S. yunnanensis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Ecological Genetics, School of Life Science, Yunnan University, Kunming, 650091, P.R.
