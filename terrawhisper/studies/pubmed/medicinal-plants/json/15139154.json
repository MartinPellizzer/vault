Rats were treated with isoproterenol 1.25 micrograms.kg-1 i.p., and then the increasing of heart rate and the bradycardia effect were measured after administrated with Zhimu or Huangqi for 3 days. 2. Mice cardiac hypertrophy model was established by s.c. ISO 1 mg.kg-1, 2 times per day for 14 days and heart-weight-index was measured after Zhimu and Huangqi was given orally alone or jointly for 14 days. 3. Abdominal aorta banding operation was done in mice and 3 weeks after operation, they were administrated for 2 weeks, and then run-time(exercise capacity), quiet heart rate, ISO response heart rate after i.p. isoproterenol and heart-weight-index were measured. 4. Cardiac hypertrophy model (inject ISO 14 days) mice were administrated for 12 days, and the mortality and dying time of mice in cold (-20 degrees C) and heat(45 degrees C) stimulative condition were observed.", "Zhimu could cut down the increasing of heart rate induced by ISO, decrease significantly heart-weight-index in cardiac hypertrophy mice, reduce the quiet heart rate and prolong the run time in abdominal banding model.
