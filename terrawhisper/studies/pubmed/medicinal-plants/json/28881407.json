A PLSR model was built from the obtained spectral data using 70% of the AKBA working standard solutions (training set), ranging from 0.1\u00a0ppm to 100\u00a0ppm. The final PLSR showed a R<sup>2</sup> value of 99% with a root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) value of 0.39% and a R<sup>2</sup> value of 99%.", "The results showed that a 50% CHCl<sub>3</sub> /n-hexane sub-fraction has the highest concentration of AKBA (14.8%), followed by 55% CHCl<sub>3</sub> /n-hexane (13.6%), and 40% CHCl<sub>3</sub> /n-hexane (6.1%).", "As the results achieved with the proposed NIRS methodology are in close agreement to the results of AKBA analysis using HPLC, we suggest that our proposed NIRS method is a fast alternative and non-destructive method for the analysis of AKBA in different samples of B. sacra.
