Twelve rabbits were killed at the end of this period for baseline observations (Group I). The remaining animals were divided into two groups; Group II was fed stock diet and Group II was fed essential oil of garlic added to the stock diet. All the animals were killed at the end of 12 months. Blood lipids and fibrinolysis were monitored during the progression and regression phases. After cholesterol feeding was discontinued, serum total cholesterol and triglyceride concentration decreased gradually in both the groups. However, there was an increase in HDL levels in the garlic fed groups. Cholesterol feeding resulted in 80.9% atheromatous involvement of aortic surface in Group I. This remained almost the same (71.1%) after 9 months of stock feeding (Group II) while in the garlic fed group only 30.4% of the aortic surface had lesions. Correspondingly, the aortic lipid content of garlic fed animals was reduced by 72%, while in the control group there was no significant reduction. The data suggests that cholesterol is depleted from experimentally induces atherosclerosis by garlic administration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bordia", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Artery", "NlmUniqueID": "7508494", "ISSNLinking": "0098-6127"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aorta"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Arteriosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fibrinolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7213027"]}}]}
