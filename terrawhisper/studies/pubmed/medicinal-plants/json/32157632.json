In this study, the biological and physicochemical characteristics of a nanostructured iron-polysaccharide complexes (Nano-IPC) biosynthesized by Enterobacter sp. were evaluated. Furthermore, the serum biochemical parameters, tissue iron level, red blood cell parameters, and organ ferritin of rats were measured for investigating the effect of the Nano-IPCs in comparison with FeSO<sub>4</sub> as a supplement for iron deficiency. The biosafety data demonstrated 35% increment of viability in Hep-G2 hepatocarcinoma cell lines when treated with nanoparticles (500\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) for 24\u00a0h. Besides, iron concentration in serum and tissue as well as the expression of ferritin L subunit in animals treated with the Nano-IPCs supplement were meaningfully higher than the FeSO<sub>4</sub>-supplemented and negative control animals. Moreover, the expression level of ferritin H subunit and biochemical factors remained similar to the negative control animals in the Nano-IPC-supplemented group. These results indicated that Nano-IPCs can be considered as a nontoxic supplement for patients carrying iron-deficiency anemia (IDA)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, P.O.
