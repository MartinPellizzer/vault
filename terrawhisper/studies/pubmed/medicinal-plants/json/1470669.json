A. Meyer, were compared for their anti-ulcer activity. Of these four polysaccharide fractions, the water-soluble crude polysaccharide fraction (GL-2) from the leaves and the alkaline-soluble crude polysaccharide fraction (GRA-2) from the roots prevented HCl/ethanol-induced ulcerogenesis in mice potently. The most potent fraction, GL-2, was further fractionated into four polysaccharide fractions by precipitation with cethyltrimethylammonium bromide, and the weakly acidic polysaccharide fraction, GL-4, showed the most potent inhibition of gastric lesion formation. The activity of GL-4 decreased after treatment with periodate or digestion with endo-polygalacturonase, indicating that the carbohydrate moiety may contribute to the expression of the activity. GL-4 was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration, and the most active purified polysaccharide, GL-4IIb1III was obtained. GL-4IIb1III (average relative molecular mass, 16,000 d) had the nature of a pectic polysaccharide, and was composed mainly of galactose and galacturonic acid with small proportions of rhamnose, arabinose, mannose, glucose, and glucuronic acid. GL-4IIIb1III prevented HCl/ethanol-induced ulcerogenesis in mice dose dependently."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oriental Medicine Research Center, Kitasato Institute, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "X B", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsumoto", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1470669", "10.1055/s-2006-961510"]}}]}
