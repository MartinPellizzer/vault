Twenty two patients with CHF (13 dilated, 4 restrictive cardiomyopathy, 5 congenital heart defects) and 7 cases with hypertension were treated for 1 to 31 months (mean, 9 months). The dose of captopril varied from 1 to 3 mg/kg/day (mean, 2.2 mg) in CHF and from 1.1 to 6.8 mg/kg/day (mean, 3.7 mg) in hypertension. In CHF digoxin therapy was maintained while the dose of diuretics could be reduced or discontinued. In 4 severely hypertensive patients the addition of a diuretic or beta blockers was necessary. In CHF clinical improvement was observed in 13 patients (59%), while there was no response in 4 and 5 patients died. The survivors exhibited a significant decrease of the cardiothoracic index (p less than 0.05), the PEP/LVET ratio (p less than 0.05) and an increase of the echocardiographic linear ejection fraction (p less than 0.001). If hypertension was present, blood pressure decreased in all patients (p less than 0.05). Captopril was well tolerated by all patients except one who developed anaemia. This side effect disappeared after having discontinued the drug. These findings suggest that captopril is of benefit in controlling chronic CHF. Captopril alone or in combination with other drugs is effective in the management of severe hypertension."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest."}], "LastName": "Bendig", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Temesv\u00e1ri", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Hungary", "MedlineTA": "Acta Physiol Hung", "NlmUniqueID": "8309201", "ISSNLinking": "0231-424X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diuretics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9G64RSX1XD", "NameOfSubstance": "Captopril"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Captopril"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiomyopathy, Dilated"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiomyopathy, Restrictive"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Diuretics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Failure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension, Renovascular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Stroke Volume"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3075397"]}}]}
