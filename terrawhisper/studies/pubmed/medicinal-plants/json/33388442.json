Possibly, the most problematic aspect that prevents systematic method development is finding models that describe without bias the retention behaviour of the compounds in the samples. In this work, the use of global models (able to describe the whole sample) is proposed as an alternative to the use of individual models for each solute. Global models contain parameters that are specific for each solute, while other parameters \u2012related to the column and solvent\u2012 are common for all solutes. A special regression procedure is presented for the construction of global models, which are applied to predict highly complex chromatograms, such as chromatographic fingerprints, for diverse experimental conditions in isocratic and gradient elution. Another interesting application is the prediction of molecular properties, such as log\u00a0P<sub>o/w</sub>, from the specific solute parameters of the global models. The examined adapted models are based on the equations proposed by Snyder, Schoenmakers, Neue and Kuss, Jandera, and Bosch Ros\u00e9s to describe the retention. In all cases, the predictive capability was very satisfactory. Two cases of study were considered: chromatograms of camomile extracts analysed using acetonitrile gradients, and a set of 145\u00a0known compounds in a wide range of structures and functionalities, eluted isocratically with acetonitrile/water mobile phases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
