Melochia corchorifolia Linn. (MC) has been used as folk medicine to treat various diseases. However, the effect of MC on melanogenesis remains unknown.", "In this study, we investigated the effect of MC extract on melanogenesis and its underlying mechanisms in B16F10 mouse melanoma cells.", "B16F10 cells were treated with MC extract, and then, cell viability, melanin content, and tyrosinase activity were analyzed. The mRNA and protein expression of tyrosinase and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) were evaluated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting, respectively. Phosphorylated or total protein levels in MC extract-induced signaling pathways were analyzed by Western blotting.", "Treatment of B16F10 cells with MC extract inhibited melanin synthesis and intracellular tyrosinase activity in a dose-dependent manner with no cytotoxicity. Protein and mRNA expressions of tyrosinase and MITF were also significantly decreased by MC extract treatment. In addition, phosphorylated level of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was obviously increased by MC extract, but AKT pathway was not activated. Inhibited ERK phosphorylation by pretreatment with a selective ERK inhibitor PD98059 significantly reversed the decreased melanin content induced by treatment with MC extract in B16F10 cells.", "MC extract inhibits melanogenesis in B16F10 mouse melanoma cells through suppression of MITF-tyrosinase signaling pathway by ERK activation."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Yanbian University Hospital, Yanji, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cutaneous Aging Research, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Human-Environment Interface Biology, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Xing-Hua", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cutaneous Aging Research, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Human-Environment Interface Biology, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University Graduate School, Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Yu-Dan", "Initials": "YD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cutaneous Aging Research, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Human-Environment Interface Biology, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "Jang-Hee", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, Ha Noi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Bach", "ForeName": "Tran The", "Initials": "TT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cutaneous Aging Research, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Human-Environment Interface Biology, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University Graduate School, Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Jin Ho", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0397-3225"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Yanbian University Hospital, Yanji, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Zhe-Hu", "Initials": "ZH"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "81903196", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Cosmet Dermatol", "NlmUniqueID": "101130964", "ISSNLinking": "1473-2130"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Melanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.18.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Monophenol Monooxygenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Malvaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Melanins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Melanoma, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Monophenol Monooxygenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Slominski A, Tobin DJ, Shibahara S, et al.
