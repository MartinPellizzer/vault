HFRs have been shown to be developmentally toxic to animals and also affect plant growth. However, little was known about the molecular mechanism responded by when plants were treated with these compounds. In this study, when Arabidopsis was exposed to four HFRs (TBBPA, TCBPA, TBBPS-MDHP, TBBPS), the stress of these compounds had different inhibitory effects on seed germination and plant growth. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis showed that all four HFRs could influence the expression of transmembrane transporters to affect ion transport, Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, Plant-pathogen interaction, MAPK signalling pathway and other pathways. In addition, the effects of different kinds of HFR on plants also have variant characteristics. It is very fascinating that Arabidopsis shows the response of biotic stress after exposure to these kinds of compounds, including the immune mechanism. Overall, the findings of the mechanism recovered by methods of transcriptome and metabolome analysis supplied a vital insight into the molecular perspective for Arabidopsis response to HFRs stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
