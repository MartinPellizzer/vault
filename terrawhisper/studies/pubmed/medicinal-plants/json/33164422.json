Phytochemical studies on the plants in the genus have demonstrated a large amount of terpenoids and alkaloids. Modern pharmacological studies have demonstrated cytotoxicity, antivirus, antibacterial, anti-inflammation and other pharmacological activities. In this paper, chemical compositions and biological activities of Trigonostemon genus at home and abroad over the past decade were summarized, in order to provide scientific basis for the further development and utilization of Trigonostemon plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Hainan University Haikou 570228, China Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Resources Conservation and Development of Southern Medicine, Hainan Branch Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College Haikou 570311, China."}], "LastName": "Bo-Wen", "ForeName": "Wang", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Resources Conservation and Development of Southern Medicine, Hainan Branch Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College Haikou 570311, China Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Y U", "Initials": "YU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Resources Conservation and Development of Southern Medicine, Hainan Branch Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College Haikou 570311, China."}], "LastName": "Jian", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Resources Conservation and Development of Southern Medicine, Hainan Branch Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College Haikou 570311, China."}], "LastName": "Yang-Yang", "ForeName": "Liu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Resources Conservation and Development of Southern Medicine, Hainan Branch Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College Haikou 570311, China Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "De-Li", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Hainan University Haikou 570228, China."}], "LastName": "Ping-Huai", "ForeName": "Liu", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Euphorbiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "40"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33164422", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200710.601"]}}]}
