Pharmacopoeial standards are typically used by industry as a basis for meeting QC requirements and current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs). TLC is a relatively low-cost, highly versatile tool for developing specifications for raw materials, as well as for the various preparations for which pharmacopoeial standards are created. In addition to its use in the development of identity tests, TLC is a valuable tool for screening plant samples that pharmacopoeias must review in the development of monographs and botanical reference materials (BRMs). Specifically, HPTLC is the ideal TLC technique for these purposes because of its increased accuracy, reproducibility, and ability to document the results, compared with standard TLC. Because of this, HPTLC technologies are also the most appropriate TLC technique for conformity with GMPs. This article highlights the manner in which HPTLC is used by the American Herbal Pharmacopoeia (AHP) in the development of AHP monograph identity standards, the identification of adulterating species, and the development of AHP-verified BRMs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "American Herbal Pharmacopoeia, P.O.
