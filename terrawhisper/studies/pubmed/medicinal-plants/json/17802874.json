And the changes of catalpol and 5-HMF was determinated. The extraction of 5-HMF and catalpol was sonicated in 30% methanol for 2 h. The analysis of 5-HMF and catalpol was conducted by HPLC with reversed-phase C-18 column and detected under UV 284 nm, 204 nm. Elution was carried out at 1.0 mL min(-1) with 3% acetonitrile.", "From this analysis, we found out that the content of catalpol was decreased with the number of processing times, and content of 5-HMF was increased with the number of processing times at various processing. The temperature and concentration of ethanol can effect on content of catalpol and 5-HMF at processing. The Cooked Rehmanniae Radix processed at 100 degrees C, 10% ethanol is best. And the content of 5-HMF processed for more than 7 times was accorded with standard of Korea phamcopoetia.", "Analyze the effect of concentration of catalpol and 5-HMF from Rehmanniae Radix at various processing, and provide the foundation for further study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oriental Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Phamacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130701, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Mei-fen", "Initials": "MF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiang-qian", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ju-hee", "ForeName": "Oh", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang-soo", "ForeName": "Yook", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Je-Hyun", "ForeName": "Lee", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoid Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2415-24-9", "NameOfSubstance": "catalpol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "70ETD81LF0", "NameOfSubstance": "5-hydroxymethylfurfural"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DJ1HGI319P", "NameOfSubstance": "Furaldehyde"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Furaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iridoid Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Iridoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Tubers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rehmannia"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Technology, Pharmaceutical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17802874"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
