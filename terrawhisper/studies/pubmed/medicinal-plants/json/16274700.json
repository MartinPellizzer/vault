To overcome some of the drawbacks, we have applied high throughput pharmacological screening (HTPS) to crude plant extracts. Using a \"differential smart screen\", (DSS) the spectrum of activity contained in a crude extract is measured at several closely related receptor subtypes. This spectrum is then compared to that of known compounds. A unique spectrum suggests that the extract merits further investigation. Evaluation of species and environmental libraries of whole plants has demonstrated the value of this approach for rapid prioritization of plants for investigation. In addition, genomic and genetic manipulation of plants and plant cell cultures can increase the value of DSS. For example, the whole genomic potential of a plant species for biodiversity can be accessed by using gain of function mutations to generate a \"functional genomics library\" of mutant clonal cultures, and the bioactivity of these cultures tested by DSS. Clones that overproduce activity differing from the wild-type plant can be identified in this way. This \"Natural Products Genomics\" (NPG) strategy is limited by the massive numbers of clonal cultures that are required to cover all possible gain-of-function mutations. The rapidity and efficiency of this process can be improved by using transgenic plants expressing appropriate mammalian proteins. These may be designed to make the plant cell resemble a human cell for a specific form of toxicity. Now, \"unnatural selection\" of resistant mutant clones can be used to provide a sub-population potentially enriched in useful compounds. Alternatively, transgenic plant cells can be used for \"in situ screening\" in which a mammalian receptor protein, linked to a reporter construct, such as green fluorescent protein, is expressed. Clonal cultures that produce ligands for this receptor can now be rapidly identified visually in an ultra-HTPS. Overall, our aim is to use pharmacological screening, together with functional genomic approaches, to make plant drug discovery competitive with combinatorial chemistry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kentucky Tobacco Research and Development Center, University of Kentucky, Cooper and University Drives, Lexington, KY 40546-0236, USA. jlittlet@uky.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Littleton", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rogers", "ForeName": "Trent", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Falcone", "ForeName": "Deane", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375521", "ISSNLinking": "0024-3205"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Nicotinic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kentucky"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radioligand Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Nicotinic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16274700", "10.1016/j.lfs.2005.09.013", "S0024-3205(05)00884-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
