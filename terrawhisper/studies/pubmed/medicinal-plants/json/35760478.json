Even though, the todays first line anti-mycobacterial treatments used in the hospital have low deaths, multidrug-resistance forms of the ailment have now spread globally and become a major issue. The wide-ranging biodiversity of medicinal plants, ocean animals have gained considerable attention for drug discovery in previous spans, and the emergence of TB drug resistance has inspired interest in judging natural products (NPs) to cure this disease. Till now, several compounds have been isolated from natural sources with anti-mycobacterial activity, few of which demonstrate significant activity and have the potential for further development. Worldwide huge natural flora and fauna are existing, this flora and fauna must be investigated for new potent lead against infectious TB. This review systematically surveys various classes of terpenoid molecules obtained from different medicinal plants, fungi, sponges, and sea plumes with anti-TB activity, which could be useful for further optimization and development in this field."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Tuberculosis Association of India.
