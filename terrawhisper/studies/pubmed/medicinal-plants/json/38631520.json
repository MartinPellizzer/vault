Di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) is one of the most important factors in this type of pollution. Currently, research from international sources has demonstrated the significant reproductive toxicity of DBP. However, most of these studies have focused mainly on hormones expression at the protein and mRNA levels and the specific molecular targets of DBP and its mechanisms of action remain unclear. In this study, we established a Sprague Dawley pregnant mouse model exposed to DBP, and all male offspring were immediately euthanized at birth and bilateral testes were collected. We found through transcriptome sequencing that cell apoptosis and MAPK signaling pathway are the main potential pathways for DBP induced reproductive toxicity. Molecular biology analyses revealed a significant increase in the protein levels of JNK1(MAPK8) and BAX, as well as a significant increase in the BAX/BCL2 ratio after DBP exposure. Therefore, we propose that DBP induces reproductive toxicity by regulating JNK1 expression to activate the MAPK signaling pathway and induce reproductive cell apoptosis. In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence that the MAPK signaling pathway is involved in DBP-induced reproductive toxicity and highlights the importance of JNK1 as a potential target of DBP in inducing reproductive toxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
