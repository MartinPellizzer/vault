The butanol layer was separated and shaken with hydrochloric acid for 3 minutes to convert the TPB complexes to hydrochlorides, then washed with water until the pH reached 3, and dried. Ether was added to the dried butanol fraction, fo rming a fluffy yellow precipitate, treated again, forming an almost white precipitate, then examined by chromatography. During the n-butanol and ether treatment some serotonin known to be present in the plant was coprecipitated; in reprecipitation this remained in solution. 2 polypeptides were found. Both came from the same fraction, gave the same ultraviolet spectrum, the same color reaction, and had the same biological effect. After separation with Tlc only the compound with the highest RF value was isolated in sufficient quantities for degration. The amino acid composition has been determined and further structural studies are in progress."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["735065", "00025112"], "GeneralNote": [], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Abortifacient Agents", "Biology", "Endocrine System", "Examinations And Diagnoses", "Hormones", "Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses", "Laboratory Procedures", "Oxytocin--analysis", "Physiology", "Pituitary Hormones", "Serotonin"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "4744557", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1973", "Month": "12", "Day": "14"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2014", "Month": "11", "Day": "20"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0024-5461", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "36", "Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1973", "Month": "Jun"}}, "Title": "Lloydia", "ISOAbbreviation": "Lloydia"}, "ArticleTitle": "Isolation of oxytocic peptides from Oldenlandia affinis by solvent extraction of tetraphenylborate complexes and chromatography on sephadex LH-20.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "207", "EndPage": "208", "MedlinePgn": "207-8"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grain", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Lloydia", "NlmUniqueID": "0376626", "ISSNLinking": "0024-5461"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzene Derivatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Boron Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxytocics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzene Derivatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Boron Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Folklore"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxytocics"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Uterus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1973", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1973", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1973", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4744557"]}}]}
