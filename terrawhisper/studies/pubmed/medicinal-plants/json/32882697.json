Burtt. et Smith has been used as a flavor additive in food and a traditional medicine for centuries, especially in Guizhou Province, China, and it prolongs people's lives with multiple beneficial effects. Thus, one of the aims of this review was to expound the chemical constituents of this plant, especially its fruits. Since cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, pose a health threat to humans, another aim was to expound the possible mechanisms of its potential use as an herbal medication for atherosclerosis.", "In this study, 10 reports are cited to expound the potential bioactive compounds. Moreover, 33 reports explain the antihypertensive and antiatherosclerotic effects of the plant by ameliorating inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, increasing vasodilation, improving hyperlipidemia, downgrading the glucose status, and working as an antioxidant.", "A. zerumbetis rich in terpenes, essential oils, flavonoids, polyphenolics, and sterols. Pharmacological experiments showed that A. zerumbet has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects on the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and can ameliorate oxidative stress in the NOS-NO signaling pathway. Moreover, A. zerumbet demonstrates antihypertensive effects by accelerating vasorelaxant response and increasing 3T3-L1 intracellular cAMP, which has promising antiobesity properties, as well as hypolipidemic and anti-diabetic complication effects.", "A. zerumbet has potential functions and applications in the prevention of atherosclerosis, but further studies are required before clinical trials."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 The Author(s) Published by S.
