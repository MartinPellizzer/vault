The inhibitory effect of EtOH on acquisition was significantly reduced following single or repeated RGTS administration. The nootropic drugs, piracetam and N-methyl-D-glucamine, given orally significantly reduced impairment of acquisition induced by EtOH. On the other hand, the inhibitory effect of repeated RGTS on the EtOH-induced amnesia was blocked by the pretreatment of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MT), an inhibitor of catecholamine synthesis, in a dose-dependent manner but not p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis, whereas the inhibitory effect of repeated N-methyl-D-glucamine on the EtOH-induced amnesia was blocked neither by alpha-MT nor PCPA. These results suggest that repeated RGTS and N-methyl-D-glucamine ameliorate the impairing effect of EtOH on acquisition, and the effect of RGTS on EtOH-induced amnesia is dependent on the catecholaminergic but not serotonergic neuronal activity, while RGTS and N-methyl-D-glucamine seem to have a different mechanism on EtOH-induced amnesia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Chungnam National University, Taejon, South Korea.
