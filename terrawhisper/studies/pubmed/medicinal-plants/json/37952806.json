In our prior research, we extensively elucidated the properties of branch-structure fructo-oligosaccharides derived from Polygonatum Cyrtonema Hua (referred to as PCOS). However, the characteristics of hydrogels based on fructo-oligosaccharides remain to be fully explored. In present work, we developed an injectable, PCOS/carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) hydrogel which is a dual ion-physical cross-linked hydrogel that can be considered as a potential diabetic wound dressing. The tests showed that the optimal ratios for hydrogel preparation were 2\u00a0% CBM 940 (Carbomer 940), 5\u00a0% CMC and 10\u00a0% PCOS. The resultant hydrogel was formulated into composite hydrogels that were then used for the treatment of full-thickness excisional wounds in a db/db diabetic mouse model. Wound closure and histological evaluation confirmed its beneficial effect on wound healing. Further morphological analysis through scanning electron microscopy images revealed a porous hydrogel structure, while Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy provided structural insights on the crosslinking reaction. Physicochemical properties of the hybrid hydrogels determined by rheological properties, thermogravimetric, water loss rate, et al., indicated that the double crosslinking PCOS/CMC hybrid hydrogel showed enhanced dynamic mechanical properties and water retention capacity compared to the CMC cellulose matrix hydrogels. Thus, this novel PCOS-hybrid hydrogel exhibited good dissolvability and injectable properties, which was proved to facilitate for the diabetic wound healing both in vitro and in vivo test and holds a potential clinical application in the wound healing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
