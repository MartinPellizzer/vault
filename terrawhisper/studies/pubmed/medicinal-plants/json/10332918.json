The use of these treatments by prostate cancer patients seems to at least parallel or exceed that of recent surveys for other groups. Unfortunately, much of the attention of nontraditional treatments has focused on \"what to take and not to take,\" rather then \"how to approach\" the use of these therapies. One of the most widely used nontraditional treatments is the use of supplements. Outlined here are 10 general rules that the clinician should know before consulting on these treatments. Recording supplement use as a part of the general medical history, knowing the general behavior of supplement users, instructing individuals on the proper time to use supplements, and focusing on more than prostate cancer for our example patient are just some of the rules that will enable the health professional to be better equipped for handling this unique area of medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Urology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109-0330, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moyad", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Semin Urol Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "9514993", "ISSNLinking": "1081-0943"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Advertising"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Communication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medical History Taking"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Patient Acceptance of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Patient Education as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Prostatic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quackery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Referral and Consultation"}], "NumberOfReferences": "52"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10332918"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
