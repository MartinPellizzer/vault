Thirty diabetic patients with metabolic syndrome whose glycemic status was not controlled despite receiving full doses of oral hypoglycemic agents did not want to start insulin therapy and were randomly allocated to three groups to receive placebo, simple oxymel, or C. spinosa oxymel (10 mL/thrice daily for 3 months). All patients continued conventional therapy with hypolipidemic, antihyperlipidemic, and antihypertensive drugs during the study.", "C. spinosa oxymel significantly decreased the body weight and body mass index at the end of the study compared to the baseline. While the patients in the placebo and simple oxymel groups displayed further increase in the level of FBG or PPBG, administration of C. spinosa oxymel inhibited the progression of hyperglycemia. Nevertheless, there was not a significant difference between placebo and intervention groups regarding HbA1c at the end of the study. C. spinosa oxymel had no significant effect on the serum cholesterol but inhibited the progression of hypertriglyceridemia during the study. There were no significant changes in creatinine, microalbuminuria, AST, ALT, and ALP values following C. spinosa treatment, suggesting that it had no unwanted effects on kidney and liver function.", "The results suggest that although C. spinosa oxymel cannot enhance the effects of hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic drugs, it can prevent further increase of blood glucose and triglycerides in patients with poorly controlled diabetes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vahid", "ForeName": "Hamideh", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrine Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bonakdaran", "ForeName": "Shokoufeh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrine Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khorasani", "ForeName": "Zahra Mazloum", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jarahi", "ForeName": "Lida", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rakhshandeh", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Education, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zarghi", "ForeName": "Nazila", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yousefi", "ForeName": "Mahdi", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "101269157", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Mass Index"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Capparis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertriglyceridemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30657033", "10.2174/1871530318666180821131201", "EMIDDT-EPUB-92561"]}}]}
