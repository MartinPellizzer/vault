Across the world, these types of health problems are now considered top priorities for government health organizations. Hence, this study aimed to investigate medicinal plants' potential for treating cancer and inflammatory disorders. This network pharmacology analysis aims to learn more about the potential targets and mechanisms of action for the bioactive ingredients in <i>Sauropus androgynus</i> (L.) Merr L. The compound-target network and protein-protein interaction analysis were built using the STRING database. Using Network Analyst, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes, pathway enrichment was performed on the hub genes. 1-hexadecanol was shown to inhibit drug-metabolizing enzymes in a pharmacokinetic investigation. Those samples of 1-hexadecanol were found to be 1-hexadecanol (BBB 0.783), GI High, Pgp Substrate Yes, CYP2C19 Inhibitor Yes, CYP2D6 Yes, and HI -89.803. The intermolecular binding energies for 1-hexadecanol (4-DRI, -8.2\u2009kcal/mol) are evaluated. These results from a study on <i>S. androgynus</i> used molecular docking and network pharmacology to gain insight into the prime target genes and potential mechanisms identified for AKT1, mTOR, AR, PPID, FKBP5, and NR3C1. The PI3K-Akt signalling pathway has become an important regulatory node in various pathological processes requiring coordinated actions. Stability and favourable conformations have been resolved by considering nonbonding interactions such as electrostatic and hydrogen bonds in MD simulations of the perfect molecules using the Desmond package. Thus, using an appropriate platform of network pharmacology, molecular docking, and <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> experiments, this study provides for the first time a clearer knowledge of the anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory molecular bioactivities of <i>S. androgynus.</i> Further <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> and <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> confirmations are strongly needed to determine the efficacy and therapeutic effects of 1-hexadecanol in the biological process.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
