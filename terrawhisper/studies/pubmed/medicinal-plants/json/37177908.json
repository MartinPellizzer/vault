Polysaccharides and flavonoids, including anthocyanins, are important components of D. officinale that largely determine the nutritional quality and consumer appeal. There is a need to study the molecular mechanisms regulating anthocyanin and polysaccharide biosynthesis to enhance D. officinale quality and its market value. Here, we report that high light (HL) induced the accumulation of polysaccharides, particularly mannose, as well as anthocyanin accumulation, resulting in red stems. Metabolome and transcriptome analyses revealed that most of the flavonoids showed large changes in abundance, and flavonoid and polysaccharide biosynthesis was significantly activated under HL treatment. Interestingly, DoHY5 expression was also highly induced. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that DoHY5 directly binds to the promoters of DoF3H1 (involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis), DoGMPP2, and DoPMT28 (involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis) to activate their expression, thereby promoting anthocyanin and polysaccharide accumulation in D. officinale stems. DoHY5 silencing decreased flavonoid- and polysaccharide-related gene expression and reduced anthocyanin and polysaccharide accumulation, whereas DoHY5 overexpression had the opposite effects. Notably, naturally occurring red-stemmed D. officinale plants similarly have high levels of anthocyanin and polysaccharide accumulation and biosynthesis gene expression. Our results reveal a previously undiscovered role of DoHY5 in co-regulating anthocyanin and polysaccharide biosynthesis under HL conditions, improving our understanding of the mechanisms regulating stem color and determining nutritional quality in D. officinale. Collectively, our results propose a robust and simple strategy for significantly increasing anthocyanin and polysaccharide levels and subsequently improving the nutritional quality of D. officinale."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Plant Physiology and Ecology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Dongxiao", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Ornamental Plant Germplasm Innovation and Utilization, Environmental Horticulture Research Institute, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guangzhou, 510640, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Guangying", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Plant Physiology and Ecology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Plant Physiology and Ecology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Zhenqin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Plant Physiology and Ecology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Ruan", "ForeName": "Siyou", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Plant Physiology and Ecology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Ornamental Plant Germplasm Innovation and Utilization, Environmental Horticulture Research Institute, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guangzhou, 510640, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zaihua", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Plant Physiology and Ecology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Sujuan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9148-9937"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Plant Physiology and Ecology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine Research on Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, 510375, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Hong-Lei", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4957-0509"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Plant Physiology and Ecology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicinal Resource from Lingnan (Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine), Ministry of Education, Guangzhou, 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Bin", "Initials": "HB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant J", "NlmUniqueID": "9207397", "ISSNLinking": "0960-7412"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthocyanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Anthocyanins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "An, J., Liu, Y., Zhang, X., Bi, S., Wang, X., You, C. et\u00a0al.
