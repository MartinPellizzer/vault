However, they are associated with various side effects, including cardiocytotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, myelosuppression, neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, mucositis, and alopecia, which severely affect the quality of life of cancer patients. Plants harbor a great chemical diversity and flexible biological properties that are well-compatible with their use as adjuvant therapy in reducing the side effects of cancer therapy.", "This review aimed to comprehensively summarize the molecular mechanisms by which phytochemicals ameliorate the side effects of cancer therapies and their potential clinical applications.", "We obtained information from PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Google scholar, and introduced the molecular mechanisms by which chemotherapeutic drugs and irradiation induce toxic side effects. Accordingly, we summarized the underlying mechanisms of representative phytochemicals in reducing these side effects.", "Representative phytochemicals exhibit a great potential in reducing the side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to their broad range of biological activities, including antioxidation, antimutagenesis, anti-inflammation, myeloprotection, and immunomodulation. However, since a majority of the phytochemicals have only been subjected to preclinical studies, clinical trials are imperative to comprehensively evaluate their therapeutic values.", "This review highlights that phytochemicals have interesting properties in relieving the side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Future studies are required to explore the clinical benefits of these phytochemicals for exploitation in chemotherapy and radiotherapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier GmbH.
