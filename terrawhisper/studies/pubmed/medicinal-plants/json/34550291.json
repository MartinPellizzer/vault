This article will evaluate and gather evidence of the effectiveness and safety of the use of aloe vera in the treatment of burns. A systematic review was carried out on the databases: MEDLINE, LILACS, DECS, SCIELO, in the last 7 years, with the descriptors: \"Aloe\", \"Burns\" and \"treatment\". 16 articles were found. After using the exclusion criteria; research in non-humans and literature review; 5 articles were selected. The article Teplick et al. (2018) performed an in vitro clinical experiment in A. Vera solution, and demonstrated that there was proliferation and cell migration of human skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes, in addition to being protective in the death of keratonocytes. That is, it accelerates the healing of wounds. Muangman et al. (2016), evaluated 50 patients with 20% of the total body surface area burned with second-degree burns, between 18-60 years old, with half of the group receiving gauze dressings with soft paraffin containing 0.5% chlorhexidine acetate and the other half receiving polyester dressings containing extracts of medicinal plants mainly Aloe Vera. It had positive results, a higher healing speed and shorter hospital stay compared to the control group. Hwang et al. (2015) investigated the antioxidant effects of different extracts from 2,4,6,8,12 months of Aloe Vera. And the 6-month concentrated extract of 0.25 mg / mL had a higher content of flavonoids (9.750 mg catechin equivalent / g extract) and polyphenols (23.375 mg gallic acid equivalent / g extract) and the greater ferric reducing antioxidant power (0.047 mM equivalent ferrous sulfate / mg extract), that is, greater potential for free radical scavenging and also a protective effect against oxidative stress induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP), suggesting evidence of a bioactive potential of A. vera . However, in the article Kolacz et al. (2014) suggested as an alternative treatment the use of Aloe Vera dressing in combination with honey, lanolin, olive oil, wheat germ oil, marshmallow root, wormwood, comfrey root, white oak bark, lobelia inflata, glycerin vegetable oil, beeswax and myrrh, without obtaining significant and conclusive results that would allow the conventional treatment of burns to be subsidized. Finally, in the article by Zurita and Gallegos (2017), it carried out a descriptive cross-sectional study with 321 people, both sexes between 17-76 years of age, of an inductive nature, exploring the experience of this population and their behavioral attitudes regarding the treatment of dermatoses. Aloe vera had 13.8% cited by individuals in the treatment of acne and 33.6% in the treatment of burns. Even with evidence that suggests the efficacy in the treatment of burns with the use of Aloe Vera extract, further clinical trials with larger sample space on the use of Aloe vera dressings in medium burns are suggested for further conclusions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3296-0543"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centro Universit\u00e1rio S\u00e3o Camilo, Curso de Medicina, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brasil."}], "LastName": "Zago", "ForeName": "L R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9015-1958"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centro Universit\u00e1rio S\u00e3o Camilo, Curso de Medicina, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brasil."}], "LastName": "Prado", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4535-9821"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centro Universit\u00e1rio S\u00e3o Camilo, Curso de Medicina, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brasil."}], "LastName": "Benedito", "ForeName": "V L", "Initials": "VL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6614-4459"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centro Universit\u00e1rio S\u00e3o Camilo, Curso de Medicina, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brasil."}], "LastName": "Pereira", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101129542", "ISSNLinking": "1519-6984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aloe"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Burns"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "22"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34550291", "10.1590/1519-6984.249209", "S1519-69842023000100258"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
