Cross-reacting antibodies are frequently demonstrated in this family but the real clinical cross-reactivity is uncommon.", "To report a case of lupine-induced anaphylaxis and to elucidate in vivo and in vitro cross-reactivity with some legumes.", "Skin prick test (SPT) with some legumes were performed. Cap-IgE, ELISA-IgE, and immunoblotting were carried out. Open oral challenges with some legumes were performed. Cross-reactivity was studied by ELISA and immunoblotting inhibition.", "The results demonstrated type-I hypersensitivity reactions with lupine and some other legumes. Cap-IgE with peanut was positive but the SPT and ELISA-IgE were negative and the patient tolerated a peanut challenge. ELISA inhibition revealed a partial inhibition (62%) using lupine as the solid phase. Partial inhibition was demonstrated by immunoblotting inhibition. Open oral challenge with peanut and green bean were negative but positive with pea.", "We present a lupine sensitized patient with positive SPT and in vitro cross-reactivity with other legumes. Clinical cross-reactivity progressively developed over a 5-year period. Discrepancies were found between the clinical aspect and in vitro study of peanut allergy. Factors determining the wide variability in cross-reactivity among individuals are still obscure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Allergy Section, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n University General Hospital, Madrid, Spain. vmatheud@meditex.es"}], "LastName": "Matheu", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "de Barrio", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sierra", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gracia-Bara", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tornero", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Baeza", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "9503580", "ISSNLinking": "1081-1206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "37341-29-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin E"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Anaphylaxis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoblotting"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10582721", "10.1016/s1081-1206(10)62838-4"]}}]}
