MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small single-stranded non-coding RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides, known to participate in both normal and pathological development, making them ideal therapeutic targets for clinical intervention. Several recent studies have suggested that plant-derived bioactive compounds (PDBCs) can have anti-atherosclerosis, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects by regulating miRNAs. Thus, miRNAs are novel targets for the action of PDBCs.", "The aim of this review was to evaluate the current status of PDBCs targeted miRNAs by dissecting their development status through a literature review.", "A manual and electronic search was performed for English articles available from inception up to June 2022 reporting PDBCs and their regulating relationship with miRNAs for the therapeutic potential of neurological disorders. Information was retrieved from scientific databases including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Chemical Abstracts Services. Keywords used for the search engines were \"miRNAs\" AND \"Plant-derived bioactive compounds\" in conjunction with \"(native weeds OR alien invasive)\" AND \"traditional herbal medicine\".", "A total of 37 articles were retrieved on PDBCs and their related miRNAs in neurological disorders. These PDBCs from traditional herbal medicine may play a therapeutic role in neurological disorders in a variety of mechanisms by regulating the corresponding miRNAs. These mechanisms mainly include inhibiting oxidative stress, anti-neuroinflammation, anti-autophagy, and anti-apoptosis. PDBC are a group of chemically distinct compounds derived from medicinal plants, some of which have therapeutic effects on neurological disorders.", "The emergence of miRNAs as pathological regulatory factors provides a new direction for the study of bioactive compounds in Traditional Chinese medicine and the elucidating of their epigenetic effects. Elucidating the regulatory relationship between bioactive compounds and miRNAs may help to identify new therapeutic targets and promoting the application of these compounds in precision medicine through their targeted molecular activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
