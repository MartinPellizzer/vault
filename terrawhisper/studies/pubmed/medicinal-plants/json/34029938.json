This review is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of Echinacea regarding its chemical composition, pharmacological action against various hepatopathy, and safety.", "A comprehensive search of published articles was conducted to focus on original publications related to Echinacea and hepatopathy till the end of 2020 using various literature databases, including China National Knowledge Infrastructure, PubMed, and Web of Science database.", "Echinacea exhibited excellent activities in resisting a variety of hepatopathy induced by different causes in preclinical experiments and clinical trials by regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, antioxidant defense mechanism, voltage-gated sodium channels, lipid metabolism, circadian rhythm, p38 MAPK signaling pathway, JNK signaling pathway, Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and Akt/GSK3 beta signaling pathways. The high efficacy of Echinacea is related to its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities. The main ingredients of Echinacea include caffeic acid derivatives, alkylamides, and polysaccharides, which have been well established in preclinical studies of liver diseases. Studies on acute and subacute toxicity show that Echinacea preparations are well-tolerated herbal medicines.", "Echinacea may offer a novel potential strategy for clinical prevention and treatment of liver diseases and related diseases. Extensive studies are necessary to identify the underlying mechanisms and establish future therapeutic potentials of this herb. Well-designed clinical trials are still warranted to confirm the safety and effectiveness of Echinacea for hepatopathy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
