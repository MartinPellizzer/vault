Aging is a multifaceted process with numerous factors affecting it. Efficient model organisms are essential for the research and development of anti-aging agents, particularly when investigating pharmacological mechanisms are needed.", "This review discusses the application of Caenorhabditis elegans for studying aging and its related signaling pathways, and presents an overview of studies exploring the mechanism and screening of anti-aging agents in C. elegans. Additionally, the review summarizes related clinical trials of anti-aging agents to inspire the development of new medications.", "Literature was searched, analyzed, and collected using PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct. The search terms used were \"anti-aging\", \"medicinal plants\", \"synthetic compounds\", \"C. elegans\", \"signal pathway\", etc. Several combinations of these keywords were used. Studies conducted in C. elegans or humans were included. Articles were excluded, if they were on studies conducted in silico or in vitro or could not offer effective data.", "Four compounds mainly derived through synthesis (metformin, rapamycin, nicotinamide mononucleotide, alpha-ketoglutarate) and four active ingredients chiefly obtained from plants (resveratrol, quercetin, Astragalus polysaccharide, ginsenosides) are introduced emphatically. These compounds and active ingredients exhibit potential anti-aging effects in preclinical and clinical studies. The screening of these anti-aging agents and the investigation of their pharmacological mechanisms can benefit from the use of C. elegans.", "Medicinal plants provide valuable resource for the treatment of diseases. A wide source of raw materials for the particular plant medicinal compounds having anti-aging effects meet diverse pharmaceutical requirements, such as immunomodulatory, anti-inflammation and alleviating oxidative stress. C. elegans possesses advantages in scientific research including short life cycle, small size, easy maintenance, genetic tractability and conserved biological processes related to aging. C. elegans can be used for the efficient and rapid evaluation of compounds with the potential to slow down aging."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
