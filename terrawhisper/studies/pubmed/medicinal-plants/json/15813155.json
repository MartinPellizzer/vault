Cancer patients have joined this global trend, often seeking supplements to conventional oncologic care, usually without their physicians' knowledge. Among the most common forms of complementary and alternative medicine used by cancer patients are natural products such as herbs and megavitamins. The extensive use of nutritional supplements by cancer patients raises multiple questions and challenges for the physician. Since there are limited scientific data on the efficacy and safety of many nutritional supplements, advising patients about when to use them during the course of illness is difficult. This is true for each stage of cancer care: prevention, acute active care (radiation, chemotherapy, surgery), and post-acute care (follow-up visits and prevention of recurrence). The authors describe a patient-centered approach to the use of nutritional supplements in cancer care."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Complementary and Alternative Medicine Education Project, Department of Family Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555-1123, USA. mafrenke@utmb.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frenkel", "ForeName": "Moshe", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ben-Arye", "ForeName": "Eran", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baldwin", "ForeName": "Constance D", "Initials": "CD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sierpina", "ForeName": "Victor", "Initials": "V"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "IR25AT00586", "Acronym": "AT", "Agency": "NCCIH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "South Med J", "NlmUniqueID": "0404522", "ISSNLinking": "0038-4348"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combined Modality Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Communication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patient-Centered Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physician-Patient Relations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}], "NumberOfReferences": "32"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15813155", "10.1097/01.SMJ.0000154776.71057.E8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
