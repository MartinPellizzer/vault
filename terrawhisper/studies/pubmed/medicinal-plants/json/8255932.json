The results show that during the oral glucose tolerance test the peak blood glucose values in rats are obtained much earlier (15-45 min) than in human subjects (around 60 min). Pulp juice of M. charantia lowered fasting blood glucose levels in normal rats (p < 0.05 at 120 min); the effect was more pronounced with the saponin-free methanol extract of the pulp juice (p < 0.05 at 60 min and p < 0.01 at 120 min). The pulp juice also had a significant hypoglycemic effect in the glucose-fed normal rats when the extract was fed 45 minutes before the oral glucose load [percentage increments over basal value (M +/- SE): 85 +/- 10 in the control group vs. 54 +/- 7 in the pulp juice group, p < 0.01]. In the IDDM model rats the pulp juice had no significant effect on blood glucose levels either in fasting or postprandial states. In the NIDDM model rats the saponin-free methanol extract of juice produced a significant hypoglycemic effect both in fasting (p < 0.05 at 120 min) and in postprandial states (sum of percentage increments over basal value: 140 +/- 26 in the control vs. 71 +/- 7 in the pulp juice group, p < 0.05). Methanol extracts of seed and of whole plant, and saponin-free methanol extract of whole plant produced no hypoglycemic effects in normal or IDDM model rats either in fasting or in postprandial states.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Division, Bangladesh Institute of Research & Rehabilitation in Diabetes, Endocrine & Metabolic Disorders (BIRDEM), Dhaka."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mamun", "ForeName": "M I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mosihuzzaman", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nahar", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nur-e-Alam", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rokeya", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8255932", "10.1055/s-2006-959720"]}}]}
