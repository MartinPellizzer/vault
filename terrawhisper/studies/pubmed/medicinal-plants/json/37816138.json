Thus, targeting the immune microenvironment and the reprogrammed metabolic processes will aid in developing novel anti-cancer drugs. In recent decades, herbal medicine has been widely utilized to treat cancer through the modulation of the immune microenvironment and reprogrammed metabolic processes. However, labor-based herbal ingredient screening is time consuming, laborious and costly. Luckily, some computational approaches have been proposed to screen candidates for drug discovery rapidly. Yet, it has been challenging to develop methods to screen drug candidates exclusively targeting specific pathways, especially for herbal ingredients which exert anti-cancer effects by multiple targets, multiple pathways and synergistic ways. Meanwhile, currently employed approaches cannot quantify the contribution of the specific pathway to the overall curative effect of herbal ingredients. Hence, to address this problem, this study proposes a new computational framework to infer the contribution of the immune microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming (COIMMR) in herbal ingredients against human cancer and specifically screen herbal ingredients targeting the immune microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming. Finally, COIMMR was applied to identify isoliquiritigenin that specifically regulates the T cells in stomach adenocarcinoma and cephaelin hydrochloride that specifically targets metabolic reprogramming in low-grade glioma. The in silico results were further verified using in vitro experiments. Taken together, our approach opens new possibilities for repositioning drugs targeting immune and metabolic dysfunction in human cancer and provides new insights for drug development in other diseases.
