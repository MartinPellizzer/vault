From this investigation three observations have been made that may be relevant to the observed lack of crossing over in heterochromatin. (1) Differential staining indicates that heterochromatin represents a smaller fraction of the length of pachytene chromosomes than it represents in the length of mitotic metaphase chromosomes. Since the synaptonemal complex (SC) runs throughout the length of these pachytene chromosomes, it is under-represented in heterochromatin. Considering the evidence for a rough correlation between the length of SC and the amount of crossing over, this could result in less crossing over in heterochromatin than expected on the basis of its length in mitotic metaphase chromosomes. (2) Electron microscopy indicates that, unlike the SC in euchromatin, the SC in heterochromatin is densely ensheathed in highly compact chromatin. If crossing over occurs in the SC or even in the surrounding chromatin, the compaction of the chromatin may prevent the penetration of enzymes needed in recombination. (3) Finally, a difference in the structure of SCs in euchromatin versus heterochromatin was observed that could be associated with the lack of crossing over in heterochromatin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stack", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0052457", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9533"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Heterochromatin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crossing Over, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Heterochromatin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meiosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metaphase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6520145", "10.1242/jcs.71.1.159"]}}]}
