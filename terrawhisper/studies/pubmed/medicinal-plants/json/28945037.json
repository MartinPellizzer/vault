This study aims to explore the material basis for the anti-tumor activity of polysaccharide. D. huoshanense was used as raw material in the experiment, and the different protein components were obtained through low salt solution extraction and ammonium sulfate fractional precipitation. Then glycoprotein components were determined by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis staining, and were further isolated and purified by DEAE ion column and Sephadex gel column. At the same time, MTT assay was used in detecting the cytotoxicity of different products on HepG2 cells in vitro. As a result, three kinds of glycoprotein components RG1, RG2, RG3 with relative molecular mass of 22.5, 19.8, 15.6 kDa were gained, and the IC\u2085\u2080 of three compounds on human liver cancer cell HepG2 was 534.23 mg\u2022L\u207b\u00b9, meanwhile IC\u2085\u2080 of single glycoprotein component RG1, RG2 was 432.96, 413.91 mg\u2022L\u207b\u00b9 respectively, and glycoprotein component RG3 had no cytotoxicity on HepG2 cells. All in all, the experiment results suggested that two kinds of glycoproteins components with relative molecular mass of 22.5, 19.8 kDa may be one of the material basis for anti-tumor activity of D. huoshanense polysaccharide, and they had a synergistic effect."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biology and Pharmaceutical Engineering, West Anhui University, Lu'an 237012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Public Safety, Cloud Computing Center Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dongguan 523808, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Engineering Technology Research Center of Plant Cell, Lu'an 237012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Synergy Innovation Center of Industrialization Development of Dendrobium, Lu'an 237012, China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biology and Pharmaceutical Engineering, West Anhui University, Lu'an 237012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Engineering Technology Research Center of Plant Cell, Lu'an 237012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Synergy Innovation Center of Industrialization Development of Dendrobium, Lu'an 237012, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Nai-Dong", "Initials": "ND"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biology and Pharmaceutical Engineering, West Anhui University, Lu'an 237012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Engineering Technology Research Center of Plant Cell, Lu'an 237012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Synergy Innovation Center of Industrialization Development of Dendrobium, Lu'an 237012, China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biology and Pharmaceutical Engineering, West Anhui University, Lu'an 237012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Engineering Technology Research Center of Plant Cell, Lu'an 237012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Synergy Innovation Center of Industrialization Development of Dendrobium, Lu'an 237012, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Nai-Fu", "Initials": "NF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hep G2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28945037", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20161222.007"]}}]}
