A number of compounds were identified in wild and cultivated dureup (53 and 46), deodeok (47 and 51) and doraji (43 and 38). Secondary metabolites, including butanal,2-methyl-, \u03b2-caryophyllene, neoclovene, \u03b1-humulene, \u03b3-curcumene, \u03b2-bisabolene, and phytol, were identified in dureup with significantly (P\u2009<\u00a00.05) different amounts between both types. In deodeok, squalene and other main components such as acetic acid, methyl ester, furan-methyl-furfural, 2-furan-methanol, and 5-methyl-furfural, were statistically different between the two types. Doraji has significantly different compounds such as furfural, 5-methyl-furfural, 2-methoxy-phenol, 2-methoxy-4-(1-propenyl)-phenol, and 1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-propanone. Although we failed to confirm the key compounds, a new compound, namely desaspidinol, was synthesized for the first time and its retention index determined under the experimental conditions. This solventless, easy technique can be used as a simple way to discriminate between wild and cultivated types of medicinal plants via identification of volatile markers or specific fingerprints."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Institute, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Technology, School of Biotechnology, International University, HCMC National University, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Truong", "ForeName": "Lieu T B", "Initials": "LTB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abd El-Aty", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, Daejeon, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyun Jin", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Institute, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "Md Musfiqur", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Institute, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sung-Woo", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "Ho-Chul", "Initials": "HC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Institute, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Shim", "ForeName": "Jae-Han", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Republic of Korea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27859496", "10.1002/bmc.3896"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
