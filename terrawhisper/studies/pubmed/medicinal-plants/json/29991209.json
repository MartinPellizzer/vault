Several trials have found hypericum to be more effective than placebo or some antidepressant drugs, but the exact mechanism and most relevant compounds are still unclear. A possible hypothesis is that the antidepressant activity might be due to its multiplicity of bioactive compounds. Aim is to test if greater chemical complexity could result in a greater hypericum antidepressant action.", "A retrospective, 12-month, open-label, observational, controlled trial was conducted to compare the antidepressant clinical activity of a conventional Hypericum perforatum (C-Hp) versus a multi-fractionated (M-Hp) one (IperiPlex\u00ae).", "Treatment with C-Hp demonstrated no efficacy after 6 months and partial (P<0.05) efficacy after 12 months. Treatment with MF-Hp demonstrated highly (P<0.01) significant results at both 6 and 12 months.
