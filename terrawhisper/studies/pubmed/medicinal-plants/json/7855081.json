There was an increase of IDF from 18.1% in cooked beans to 22.4% in fried beans, and a decrease in SDF from 8.4% to 6.6%, respectively. Starch content decreased from 34.5% to 31.3%. No change was found in lignin. The xylose content was higher in IDF than in SDF and decreased to some extent from cooked to fried beans. Arabinose content was similar in IDF and SDF with no change caused by processing. The fraction containing glucose, mannose and galactose in IDF was higher than in SDF, the content increasing in IDF and decreasing in SDF, with processing. Protein content in IDF was higher than in SDF, with no major change when processing. About 29.5% of the total protein of beans was bound in DF. Protein digestibility and protein quality decreased from cooked to fried beans and was positively related to IDF."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Nutrition of Central America and Panama (INCAP), Guatemala."}], "LastName": "Acevedo", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vel\u00e1zquez-Coronado", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bressani", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Am J Clin Nutr. 1976 Apr;29(4):417-27", "ArticleIdList": ["773166"]}, {"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 1983 May-Jun;31(3):476-82", "ArticleIdList": ["6309935"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Clin Nutr. 1984 Feb;39(2):320-37", "ArticleIdList": ["6320629"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Latinoam Nutr. 1989 Sep;39(3):392-404", "ArticleIdList": ["2562330"]}, {"Citation": "J Assoc Off Anal Chem. 1983 Jul;66(4):933-8", "ArticleIdList": ["6309732"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7855081", "10.1007/BF01088766"]}}]}
