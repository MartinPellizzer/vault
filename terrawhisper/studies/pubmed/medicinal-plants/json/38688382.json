Thymol monoterpene and quercetin, which are present in these plants, have anti-Alzheimer's and antioxidant effects. The objectives of this research were investigating the effects of these compounds on the pathogenesis and progress of Alzheimer's disease in cells modeled by formaldehyde. MTT, flow cytometry, and RT-PCR were used to investigate the toxicity, survival rate and apoptosis of the cells, and the expression level of PP2A, GSK3, NMDAR, BACE1, and APP genes, respectively. Also, the total antioxidant capacity of the modeled cells was measured. The results showed that the two compounds as well as the plants extract and essential oil were able to increase the percentage of cell survival; among them, Thymus vulgaris essential oil had the greatest effect (93.55316\u00a0% in 48\u00a0h exposure). In addition, quercetin was able to reduce the rate of apoptosis in Alzheimer's cells (4.73\u00a0%) which was greater than the effects of other compounds. In general, the essential oil of Thymus vulgaris compared to thymol; and quercetin compared to Allium cepa extract showed more improving effects on the expression of genes involved in the disease. All four compounds increased the antioxidant capacity of the modeled cells compared to the control group, and these effects were almost equal between the compounds. According to the obtained results, both plants, especially Thymus vulgaris can be proposed as candidates to be included in the diet of Alzheimer's patients. In addition, polyphenols thymol and quercetin as derivates from the studied plants can be used in new drugs development for Alzheimer's disease, with greater safety than currently used drugs. These results are significant because most of the drug for Alzheimer's treatments such as cholinesterases (e.g. rivastigmine and donepezil) and memantine are chemically based and have many side effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
