Morphological resemblances, overlapping geographical distribution, and history of traditional nomenclature have necessitated a comprehensive qualitative report for effective quality control and removing the species ambiguity pertaining to this genus. This paper provides detailed morpho-micrometric characteristics used to differentiate between six indigenous <i>Ocimum</i> species of India. Among them, <i>O. gratissimum</i> was distinguished as the only shrub with a fleshy petiole. In green and purple forms, <i>O. tenuiflorum</i> leaves had serrate margins and showed no particular anatomical differences except for the anthocyanins containing epidermal cells of the latter. <i>O. basilicum</i> had glabrous leaves except for the veins, which were puberulous. <i>O. filamentosum</i> had tenuous anther filaments and was the least aromatic while <i>O. africanum</i> had a citrusy odour, which along with the number of xylary rows, size of mesophyll cells, and epidermal cell wall architecture, distinguished it from <i>O.\u00a0americanum</i>. An HPTLC method was developed using experimental design and validated for quantification of multi-class compounds from terpenoic, phenolic acids, and flavonoids in <i>Ocimum</i> leaves. It was found linear (<i>r</i> <sup>2</sup>\u2009>\u20090.99) with recoveries between 95\u200a-\u200a100% for all compounds. The eluted bands of marker compounds were subjected to HPTLC-MS analysis as a confirmative tool. This is the first anatomical and analytical report of <i>O. filamentosum</i> Forssk. The obtained results could be effectively used for species identification using vegetative characters alone with the anatomical-HPTLC data backing up the former as a rapid and economical tool."], "CopyrightInformation": "Thieme.
