Polyherbal suspensions were formulated using extracts showing significant activity and evaluated for both physicochemical and hepatoprotective activity in comparison with LIV-52 as standard. Petroleum ether (60-80 degrees ), chloroform, benzene, ethanol and aqueous extracts of Ferula asafetida, Momordica charantia Linn and Nardostachys jatamansi were evaluated for hepatoprotective activity against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver toxicity in Wistar rats. Polyherbal suspensions were prepared by the trituration method using a suspending agent and other excipients. Formulation F3 has shown significant hepatoprotective effect by reducing the elevated serum enzyme levels such as glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase. These biochemical observations were supplemented by histopathological examination of liver sections. Various parameters evaluated for all formulations were within the official specifications. Experimental data suggested that treatment with formulation F3 enhances the recovery from carbon tetra chloride-induced hepatotoxicity. From these results it may be concluded that the F3 formulation (containing chloroform, petroleum ether and aqueous extracts of Ferula asafetida, petroleum ether and ethanol extracts of Momordica charantia Linn. and petroleum ether and ethanol extracts of Nardostachys jatamansi) demonstrated significant hepatoprotective activity, that might be due to combined effect of all these extracts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, K.
