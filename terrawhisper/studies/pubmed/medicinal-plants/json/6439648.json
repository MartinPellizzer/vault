Micronuclei were scored on exfoliated cells taken by swabbing and stained with the Feulgen reaction and fast green. The betel (areca) nut/tobacco chewers served as their own controls. Prior to the administration of vitamin A and beta-carotene, the examined betel quid chewers had elevated frequencies of micronucleated buccal mucosa cells, averaging 4.03% +/- 1.24 SD (n = 26) and 3.43% +/- 1.22 SD (n = 25), respectively. The frequency of micronucleated buccal mucosa cells in non-chewers and non-smokers was 0.51% (n = 52). Following a 9-week ingestion of vitamin A (150,000 IU/week) and beta-carotene (180 mg/week in 6 capsules), the frequency of micronucleated cells decreased significantly (p less than 0.001) to 1.70% and 1.16%, respectively. No significant shift in the frequencies of micronucleated cells was observed following the intake of canthaxanthin (180 mg/week in 6 capsules) for 9 weeks or that of a placebo. The lack of protective activity of canthaxanthin, which is a good trapper of oxygen singlets but cannot be converted into vitamin A, suggests that vitamin A and beta-carotene exert their inhibitory effect on the formation of micronuclei by a mechanism not involving the scavenging of free radicals. The efficacy of beta-carotene as an inhibitor of micronucleated cell formation, the lack of toxicity, and its availability from a multitude of dietary sources should focus attention on this carotenoid as a promising chemopreventive agent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stich", "ForeName": "H F", "Initials": "HF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stich", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rosin", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vallejera", "ForeName": "M O", "Initials": "MO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "0042124", "ISSNLinking": "0020-7136"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "01YAE03M7J", "NameOfSubstance": "beta Carotene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11103-57-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Carotenoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4C3C6403MU", "NameOfSubstance": "Canthaxanthin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Canthaxanthin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carotenoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cheek"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "beta Carotene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "12", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6439648", "10.1002/ijc.2910340602"]}}]}
