In this complex and heterogeneous disease, androgens and their receptors play a crucial role in both progression and development. Although the search for its effective treatment is still ongoing, among other priorities it requires developing better anticancer agents with greater efficacy and fewer side effects. In this regard, herbal medicines, which have been used in cancer treatment, represent a large source of new and bioactive chemical entities for the development of chemotherapeutic agents, many of them exhibiting favorable side effect and toxicity profiles compared to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. In fact, more than 50% of the current anticancer drugs originate from natural sources. Thus, the present review aims to provide an overview of the past and recent trends in the research, the role of secondary metabolites in urogenital disorders, and phytochemical assays in prostate cancer management."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, School of Medicine, Bam University of Medical Sciences, Bam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Salehi", "ForeName": "Bahare", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Antimicrobial and Biocontrol Agents Unit, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaounde I, Ngoa Ekelle, Annex Fac.
