Their structures and absolute configurations were elucidated based on comprehensive spectroscopic analyses, HRESIMS, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. Notably, compound <b>1</b> has an undescribed tetracyclic 5/8/5/7 fused carbon skeleton, and compound <b>2</b> possesses a rare multicyclic caged ring system. The biosynthetic pathway of <b>1</b> was proposed starting from <b>6</b> via a series of oxidation and cyclization reactions. Compound <b>6</b> showed excellent antiproliferation and apoptosis induction effects against A549 cell line. Additionally, compounds <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> exhibited noticeable antimicrobial ability against <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus,</i> and <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>. These findings not only developed the chemical and bioactivities diversities of ophiobolin-sesterterpenoid but also provided an idea to boost the application of natural products in the control of food pathogens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chunmei", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Ziming", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Key Laboratory of Edible Wild Plants Conservation & Utilization, College of Life Science, Hubei Normal University, Huangshi 435002, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Xian", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Topgene Biotechnology Technical Research Institute Co., Ltd., Wuhan 430064, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Topgene Biotechnology Technical Research Institute Co., Ltd., Wuhan 430064, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Qingyi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Hucheng", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7222-2142"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yonghui", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ophiobolins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesterterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Bipolaris maydis"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sesterterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bipolaris"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38325810", "10.1021/acs.jafc.3c08134"]}}]}
