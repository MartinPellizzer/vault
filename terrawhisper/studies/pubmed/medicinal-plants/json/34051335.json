The resistance to available antimalarial agents necessitate for the development of new and safe drugs for which medicinal plants provides credible alternative sources for discovering new and cheap therapeutic agents. Calotropis procera is used in several folk or traditional medicines for the treatment of various diseases across different regions of the world. In Nigeria traditional medicine, C. procera latex is used either alone or in combination with other herbs to cure common diseases including malaria. In Malaka district (Indonesia), Calotropis gigantea (a member of Apocyanceae), is one of the most used herbs to treat malaria patient via the massage method.", "This study aimed to evaluate the anti-plasmodial activity of phosphate buffer extract of Calotropis procera latex in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei.", "The plant's anti-plasmodial agent was extracted using 0.2\u00a0M-phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), followed by precipitation using acetone. 90 (ninety) mice were divided into three main groups of 30 (thirty) mice each, used for the curative, suppressive and prophylactic tests, respectively. The 30 (thirty) mice in each of the main groups were sub-divided into five groups of 6 (six) mice. The mice in the group 1, 2 and 3 (test groups) were made to receive graded doses of 25\u00a0mg/kg, 50\u00a0mg/kg and 75\u00a0mg/kg of the extract of C. procera latex intraperitoneally; group 4 (negative control group) received 0.2\u00a0ml of normal saline; while group 5 (positive control group) were administered with 5\u00a0mg/kg chloroquine. The phytochemical constituents of the plant and its intraperitoneal median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) were also undertaken.", "The freeze-dried acetone extract exhibited acute toxicity with median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) of 745\u00a0mg/kg body weight in mice. The highest percentage parasite suppression (61.85%), percentage parasite cure (50.26%), and percentage parasite prophylaxis (65.47%), were obtained for the groups treated with 75\u00a0mg/kg bodyweight/day of the extract. The least percentage parasite suppression (44.74%), percentage parasite cure (35.21%), and percentage parasite prophylaxis (45.21%), were obtained for the groups treated with 25\u00a0mg/kg body weight of the extract. Also, a dose-dependent percentage parasite suppression (53.03%), percentage parasite cure (39.70%), and percentage parasite prophylaxis (49.82%) were obtained for the groups treated with 50\u00a0mg/kg body weight. This is comparable to the groups treated with standard chloroquine. The extract also produced a significant elevation in body weight of the animals for suppressive and curative tests. However, there were observable significant decreases in body weight of the animals in the case of prophylactic test.", "This study showed that the phosphate buffer extract of C. procera latex possess anti-plasmodial activity. The results of this study can be used as a basis for further phytochemical investigations in the search for new and locally affordable antimalarial agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
