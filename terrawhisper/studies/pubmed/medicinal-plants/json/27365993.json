It is also used as medicinal food. A. paniculata is found to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities; however, its inhibitory potential on inflammatory Group IIA phospholipases A2 (PLA2) and its associated inflammatory reactions are not clearly understood. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the inhibitory/neutralizing potential of ethanolic extract of A. paniculata on the isolated inflammatory PLA2 (VRV-PL-VIIIa) from Daboii rusellii pulchella (belonging to Group IIA inflammatory secretory PLA2 [sPLA2]) and its associated edema-induced activities in Swiss albino mice. A. paniculata extract dose dependently inhibited the Group IIA sPLA2 enzymatic activity with an IC50 value of 10.3 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcg/ml. Further, the extract dose dependently inhibited the edema formation, when co-injected with enzyme indicating that a strong correlation exists between lipolytic and pro-inflammatory activities of the enzyme. In conclusion, results of this study shows that the ethanolic extract of A. paniculata effectively inhibits Group IIA sPLA2 and its associated inflammatory activities, which substantiate its anti-inflammatory properties. The results of the present study warranted further studies to develop bioactive compound (s) in ethanolic extract of A. paniculata as potent therapeutic agent (s) for inflammatory diseases.", "This study emphasis the anti-inflammatory effect of A. paniculata by inhibiting the inflammatory Group IIA sPLA2 and its associated inflammatory activities such as edema. It was found that there is a strong correlation between lipolytic activity and pro-inflammatory activity inhibition. Therefore, the study suggests that the extract processes potent anti-inflammatory agents, which could be developed as a potential therapeutic agent against inflammatory and related diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Research, School of Chemical and Biotechnology, SASTRA University, Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Kishore", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry/Bioinformatics, Institute of Science, GITAM University, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Yarla", "ForeName": "N S", "Initials": "NS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Studies in Biotechnology, Microbiology and Biochemistry, Mahajana Life Science Research Centre, SBRR Mahajana First Grade College, Affiliated to University of Mysore, Mysore, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Zameer", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering, JSS Institution Campus, Mysore, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Nagendra Prasad", "ForeName": "M N", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Biology Unit, Centre for Emerging Technologies, Jain University, Ramanagara, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Santosh", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic and Applied Sciences, Dayananda Sagar University, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "More", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry/Bioinformatics, Institute of Science, GITAM University, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "D G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxinology/Toxicology and Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Emerging Technologies, Jain University, Kanakapura, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Dhananjaya", "ForeName": "Bhadrapura Lakkappa", "Initials": "BL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacognosy Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101558769", "ISSNLinking": "0974-8490"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Nanda BL, Nataraju A, Rajesh R, Rangappa KS, Shekar MA, Vishwanath BS.
