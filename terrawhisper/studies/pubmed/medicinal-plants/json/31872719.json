The new effects of ephedra were gradually found,and the contraindications of the drug were broken in later ages. Because the principles of expanded application were not well elucidated,it is difficult to use in the clinical flexibility. Based on the characteristics of ephedra and its classic clinical application,the authors summarized the possible principles of clinical application of ephedra and the drug property and pharmacological characteristics of ephedra.Studies showed that ephedrine substances are an important material basis for the efficacy of ephedra,and its adrenergic action is the pharmacological basis of its efficacy. It is the key to grasp the autonomic function and the interaction between sympathetic/adrenal medulla and adrenal cortex for the clinical application of ephedra. The authors discussed the principles of clinical application of ephedra and the effects of processing of ephedra. Finally,the authors put forward the basic research process of clinical application of drugs,and provide ideas for the inheritance and further development of TCM experience."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhongda Hospital of Southeast University Nanjing 210009,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhi-Gang", "Initials": "ZG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China Pharmaceutical University Nanjing 211198,China."}], "LastName": "Chai", "ForeName": "Cheng-Zhi", "Initials": "CZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GN83C131XS", "NameOfSubstance": "Ephedrine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ephedra"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ephedrine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31872719", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190314.003"]}}]}
