Rats were given aqueous extracts of garlic and onion, orally or intraperitoneally, daily for a period of 4 weeks after which the rats were sacrificed. The blood was collected from the heart without anticoagulant and the serum was prepared. The level of thromboxane B2 (TXB2) in the serum was measured by radioimmunoassay. TXB2 levels in serum of rats treated with the low dose of aqueous extract of garlic (50 mg/kg) was significantly inhibited regardless of the mode of administration (orally or intraperitoneally). At the high dose of garlic and onion (500 mg/kg), a further decrease of TXB2 levels in the serum of the rats was observed. Boiled garlic and onion at high concentration (500 mg/ kg) had very little effect on TXB2 synthesis. This shows that garlic and onion should be consumed in a raw rather than cooked form in order to achieve a beneficial effect. Boiling of these plants may cause the decomposition of the potential antithrombotic ingredient present in these herbs. Garlic was found to be more potent than onion in lowering the TXB2 levels. A high dose of garlic and onion produces toxicity in the rats (unpublished observation). These results show that garlic and onion can be taken frequently in low doses without any side effects, and can still produce a significant antithrombotic effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Kuwait University, 13060 Safat, Kuwait."}], "LastName": "Bordia", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mohammed", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thomson", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Scotland", "MedlineTA": "Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids", "NlmUniqueID": "8802730", "ISSNLinking": "0952-3278"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cell Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fibrinolytic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "54397-85-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Thromboxane B2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Allium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fibrinolytic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thromboxane B2"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8860105", "10.1016/s0952-3278(96)90014-9", "S0952-3278(96)90014-9"]}}]}
