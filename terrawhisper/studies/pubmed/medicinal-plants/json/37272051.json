Baill. is a popular and widely cultivated medicinal herb in China, which has rich nutritional value and medicinal effect. In August 2022, leaves with oval and irregularly circular light brown spots from 2 to 10 mm wide with white centers were found on Schisandra chinensis growing in Fusong district (127\u00b028'E, 42\u00b033'N) of Jilin, China. The symptoms were observed in 20% of the plants of a 2 ha-1 field of Schisandra chinensis. About 50% of the leaf areas were affected. As the disease developed, the lesions grew larger and developed necrotic centers. Leaves with light brown spot symptoms from five plants were collected from the field. Five leaf pieces (3 to 5 mm2) were excised from lesion margins, surface sterilized based on Ju et al. (Ju et al. 2021), and incubated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 25\u00b0C. Six single spores were isolated from five independently infected isolates for pure culture using the single spore isolation technique (Zhang. 2003). Representative single spore isolate (ZWWZH) was selected from pure cultures for further culture. After 5 days, fluffy white aerial mycelium with pink pigmentation on the underside of the colony were observed on PDA. Mycelia became pinkish-brown as the culture aged. Microscopic observations showed the presence of elongated or pointed, and thick-walled macroconidia (n = 50), predominantly three septate, 3.40 to 7.50 \u00d7 40.34 to 61.29 \u03bcm were observed. Chlamydospores formed in chains within or on top of the mycelium. The primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990) and Bt-2a/Bt-2b (Robideau et al., 2011) were used to amplify the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA and \u03b2-tubulin (TUB2) region, respectively. The obtained sequences were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers for OQ629789 (ITS) and OQ803521(TUB2). BLASTn analysis of both ITS sequence and TUB2 sequence, revealed 100% and 99.92% sequence identity with F. acuminatum MT566456, MT560377 and KJ396328, respectively. The pathogen was identified as F. acuminatum based on morphological and molecular data. Pathogenicity tests were carried out in the greenhouse. Select five healthy Schisandra chinensis seedlings, each with each healthy leaf surfaces inoculated a 1 \u00d7 106 spores/mL solution, 3 wells on one side, 10 \u00b5L per well. Sterile ddH2O was used in the control experiment. The inoculated seedlings were incubated at 25\u00b0C with a relative humidity of 65 to 70% in a greenhouse. Four days after inoculation, all inoculated leaves exhibited the same symptoms as observed in the field, while the controls showed no symptoms. The experiment was repeated three more times with similar results. The re-isolated fungi from the inoculated plants had the same morphology and DNA sequences as the original isolate (ZWWZH) obtained from the field samples, completing Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. acuminatum causing leaf spot on Schisandra chinensis in China. F. acuminatum has seriously affected the quality of Schisandra chinensis production. The identification of leaf spot caused by F. acuminatum will enable farmers to identify practices to minimize disease on this important crop."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, 159345, Jilin Ginseng Academy, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, 130117, China, Changchun, Jilin, China; 2507546505@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhan", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, 159345, Jilin Ginseng Academy, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, 130117, China, Changchun, Jilin, China; 3355316860@163.com."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, 159345, Jilin Ginseng Academy, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, 130117, China, Changchun, Jilin, China; 972296046@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Miao", "ForeName": "Xinyue", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, 159345, Jilin Ginseng Academy, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, 130117, China, Changchun, Jilin, China; 1932491613@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ergang", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, 159345, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Changchun, Jilin, China; 1790192914@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, 159345, Jilin Ginseng Academy, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, 130117, China, Changchun, Jilin, China; ccb2021@126.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Changbao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changchun, Jilin Province, Chinachangchun, China, 130118; wode17k@163.com."}], "LastName": "Qiong", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "40"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37272051", "10.1094/PDIS-04-23-0735-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
