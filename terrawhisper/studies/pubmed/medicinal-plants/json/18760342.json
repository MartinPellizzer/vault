These resources are usually regarded as part of a culture's traditional knowledge. Therefore, the aim of this study is to collect information from local population concerning the use of medicinal plants of the Mujib region; identify the most important medicinal plants used; determine the relative importance of the species surveyed and calculate the informant consensus factor (F(ic)) in relation to medicinal plant use.", "Qualitative tools were used for data collection and to record the interviewee's personal information and topics related to the medicinal use of specific plants. The collected data were used to calculate the F(ic) and the plant use values.", "Fifty-eight plants were identified to be still in use in traditional practice in Mujib. Our results showed that the highest use values were recorded for the species Artemisia sieberi Bess. and Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn., while the highest F(ic) was cited for digestive problems. Anthropologically, women were the primary gatherers while healers were reported to be both females, predominantly, and males; yet, herbalists are deficient in this local community."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Jordan, Amman 11942, Jordan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hudaib", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohammad", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bustanji", "ForeName": "Yasser", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tayyem", "ForeName": "Rabab", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yousef", "ForeName": "Mohammed", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abuirjeie", "ForeName": "Mustafa", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aburjai", "ForeName": "Talal", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Data Collection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Jordan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Arabic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18760342", "10.1016/j.jep.2008.07.031", "S0378-8741(08)00412-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
