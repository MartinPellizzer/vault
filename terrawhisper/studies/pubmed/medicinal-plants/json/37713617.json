In late 2020, several variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged, with increased viral fitness and transmissibility by mutations of the spike proteins of the viral particle, denting hopes of the use of early-generation vaccines for a widespread protective immunity against viral infection. The use of adjuvants may enhance the immune responses of the conventional application of the COVID-19 vaccine. We have shown that the water extract of 2 \u03b2-glucan-enriched immunostimulating natural products, Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. (AM) and Coriolus versicolor (CV), could induce innate immunity-related cytokines from human monocytes (CCL5, interleukin [IL]-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1) and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1). Using BALB/c mice, orally administrated AM and CV (1,384 and 742 mg/kg/d) for 4 d after vaccination, respectively, could enhance (1) the immunoglobulin G binding activities of BNT162b2 vaccination against ancestral and Delta SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins by 5.8- and 4.3-fold, respectively; (2) the immunoglobulin G3 subclass production of BNT162b2 vaccination against ancestral and variant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins; and (3) the in vitro antibody-neutralizing activities of BNT162b2 vaccinated mice. In conclusion, combining AM and CV was effective in acting as an oral adjuvant with the messenger RNA vaccine BNT162b2 to improve the antigen binding activities against SARS-CoV-2 ancestral and variant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, probably via trained immunity of macrophages and dendritic cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.
