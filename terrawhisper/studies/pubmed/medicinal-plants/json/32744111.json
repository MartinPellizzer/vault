The structure of the purified component was preliminary characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS), high performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC) and infrared spectroscopy (IR). By examining the degree of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) in mice and carbon particle clearance index, the immunomodulatory activity was clarified. The results showed that the extraction rate of CJP was 24.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5%. After purification, the refined polysaccharides component (CJP-2) was obtained. The structural characterization results indicated that CJP-2 was mainly composed of mannose, glucose, and galactose, and its molecular weight was 790\u2009Da. Immunomodulation results showed that the low and medium levels of CJP significantly enhanced the degree of DTH in mice (P\u2009<\u20090.05). CJP can improve the clearance index of mice and enhance their charcoal removal function. The study indicates that <i>C. javanica</i> is a good source of polysaccharides, and CJP may be a new type of immunomodulator."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medcial University, Guiyang, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacology, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Traditional Chinese Medicine Processing Technology Innovation Center of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang, PR China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Lanfang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medcial University, Guiyang, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, PR China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, PR China."}], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "Yongshuai", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medcial University, Guiyang, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, PR China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiaosheng", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medcial University, Guiyang, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, PR China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Codonopsis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunomodulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32744111", "10.1080/14786419.2020.1800694"]}}]}
