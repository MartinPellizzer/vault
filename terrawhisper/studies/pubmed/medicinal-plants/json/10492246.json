In vitro experiments were performed by observing the responses to acetylcholine (ACh) and KRG of strips of rabbit corpus cavernosum. In vivo experiments were performed by measuring the cavernosal pressures after the stimulation of pelvic nerves innervating rat corpus cavernosum.", "On rabbit cavernosal muscle strips precontracted with phenylephrine (5x10(-6) M), increasing concentrations of ACh (10(-7), 10(-6), 10(-5), 10(-4) M) showed dose dependent relaxation in the control group (10(-7) M: 15.32%, 10(-6) M: 35.44%, 10(-5) M: 59.45%, 10(-4) M: 76.54%)(p<0.01). After 3 months of KRG administration, the relaxation responses to ACh were increased significantly (10(-7) M: 34.18%, 10(-6) M: 56.35%, 10(-5) M: 75.33%, 10(-4) M: 89.86%)(p<0.01). Relaxation effects of KRG were significantly increased after administering KRG for 3 months, as evident by the intracavernousal pressure to electrostimulation being 107.52 cm. water in the control group and significantly increased to 138.34 cm. water after 3 months administration of KRG (p<0.01).", "We confirmed that the long-term administration of KRG enhances erectile capacity and that its action is mediated by endothelium-derived relaxing factor and peripheral neurophysiologic enhancement."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Y D", "Initials": "YD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rha", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Urol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376374", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5347"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Penile Erection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10492246", "S0022-5347(05)68349-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
