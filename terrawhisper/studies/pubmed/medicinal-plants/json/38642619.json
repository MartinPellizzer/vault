Hydrogels play a key role in facilitating active wound recovery by absorbing exudates, maintaining moisture, and alleviating pain through cooling. In this study, type I collagen was isolated from the skin of crucian carp (Carassius carassius) and verified by amino acid analysis, FTIR, and SDS-PAGE. By adopting a new approach, luteolin was added to collagen hydrogels in situ after being dissolved in an alkaline solution. XRD and SEM confirmed the luteolin was incorporated and entirely distributed throughout the hydrogel. The plastic compression improved the young's modulus of hydrogel to 15.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.59\u00a0kPa, which is adequate for wound protection. The drug loading efficiency was 98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.47\u00a0% in the selected formulation. The luteolin-incorporated hydrogel enabled regulated drug release. We assessed the cytotoxicity using MTT and live-dead assays, as well as examined the hemocompatibility to determine the biocompatibility of the hydrogel. In vivo experiments showed that the hydrogel with luteolin had the highest wound closure rate (94.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0%) and improved wound healing with granular tissue formation, collagen deposition, and re-epithelialization. These findings indicate that this efficient drug delivery technology can accelerate the process of wound healing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
