An orthogonal test was used to optimize the technology of ultra-fine aeropulverization of Flos Caryophylli. The preliminary powder fineness, the quantities and the types of accessories were optimized by the test, according to the indices such as ultra-fine powder yield, the average particle size and the powder flowbility.", "The super-fine powder made by the method of aeropulverization was the best, but the shape and properties were not stable. In the orthogonal test, factor A (the preliminary powder fineness) and B (the types of accessories) had little effect on all indices; Factor C (the ratio of accessories) had significant effect on the powder flowbility. The best technology was A1 B3 C3.", "In this study, the obtained powder has good flowbility, average size and quality stability, so it can be promoted as the technology of ultra-fine pulverization condition for Flos Caryophylli."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210046, China. joun.yan@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Guo-jun", "Initials": "GJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Bao-chang", "Initials": "BC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Jin-huo", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yuan-xun", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Excipients"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Powders"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Excipients"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Flavones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Powders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Syzygium"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Technology, Pharmaceutical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20218301"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
