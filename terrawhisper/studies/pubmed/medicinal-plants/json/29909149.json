The IAC was prepared by coupling N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose 4B Fast Flow gel with two group-specific monoclonal antibodies. The column capacities to six AFs and six ZEN analogs ranged from 100.2\u202fng to 167.1\u202fng and from 59.5\u202fng to 244.4\u202fng, respectively. The IAC-UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated with three different matrices (Chinese yam [Dioscorea polystachya], Platycodon grandiflorum and coix seed [Semen Coicis]). Recoveries of twelve analytes from edible and medicinal herbs were in the range of 64.7%-112.1%, with relative standard deviations below 13.7%. The limits of quantification were in the range from 0.08\u202f\u03bcg\u202fkg<sup>-1</sup> to 0.2\u202f\u03bcg\u202fkg<sup>-1</sup>.
