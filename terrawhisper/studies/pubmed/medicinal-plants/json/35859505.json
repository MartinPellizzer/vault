It has been shown that children's malnutrition is the result of low household income. Rural areas in Cameroon are mainly made up of poor families. This guided the present research to analyze some socioeconomic factors and their impact on the nutritional status of pupils. Using a simple random sampling technique, 300 pupils were recruited. About 66.33% of pupils were from poor families. Obesity was more prevalent in the category of rich pupils (09.52%) compared to poor (06.53%). The height and weight of pupils studied were lower than the reference (P < 0.001). This study carried out in a single council is proven to be limited for a better understanding of the epidemiology of malnutrition among students, and large-scale studies would be adequate to better prevent and control malnutrition in rural areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "MPH & MSc, Department of Public Health, School of Health Science, Kesmonds International University, Thika, Kenya; MSc, Department of Medical Laboratory Science, Faculty of Health Science, University of Buea, Buea; MPH & MSc, Department of Health, NGO Action for the Promotion of Health including the Production and the Environment, Ngaoundere, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Ibrahim", "ForeName": "Mbarawa Marat Kofia", "Initials": "MMK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "MSc, Department of Medical Laboratory Science, Faculty of Health Science, University of Buea, Buea; MSc, NGO, Department of regulation and regulatory, National Radiation Protection Agency, Ministry of Scientific Research and Innovation, Yaounde, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Loubou", "ForeName": "Mohamadou Lawan", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "MSc, Department of Medical Laboratory Science, Faculty of Health Science, University of Buea, Buea, Cameroon; MSc, Department of Public Health, School of Health Science, University and Strategic Institute of the Estuary, Yaounde, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Luc-Aime", "ForeName": "Kagoue Simeni", "Initials": "KS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "MPH & MSc, Department of Health, NGO Action for the Promotion of Health including the Production and the Environment, Ngaoundere, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Aminou", "ForeName": "Mohamadou", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "MSc, Department of Laboratory analysis, Institute of Medical Research and Medicinal Plants, Ministry of Scientific Research and Innovation, Yaounde, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Marcellin", "ForeName": "Ndoe Guiaro", "Initials": "NG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Public Health", "NlmUniqueID": "0400673", "ISSNLinking": "0019-557X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cameroon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Malnutrition"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritional Status"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Socioeconomic Factors"}], "CoiStatement": "None"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35859505", "10.4103/ijph.ijph_1516_21", "IndianJPublicHealth_2022_66_2_193_350645"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
