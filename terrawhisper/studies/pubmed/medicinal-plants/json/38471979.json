Of them, alternariol (AOH) has attracted great attention as an \"emerging\" mycotoxin in medicinal herbs. However, a specific and high-throughput extraction method for AOH is currently lacking. Thus, developing an efficient pre-treatment technique for AOH detection is extremely vital. Here, a novel automated magnetic solid-phase extraction method was proposed for the highly efficient extraction of AOH. Combining the aptamer-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (AMNPs) and the automatic purification instrument, AOH could be extracted in medicinal herbs in high throughput (20 samples) and a short time (30\u00a0min). The main parameters affecting extraction were optimized, and the method was finally carried out by incubation AMNPs with 3\u00a0mL of sample solution for 10\u00a0min, and then desorption in 75% methanol for liquid-phase detection. Under optimal conditions, good reproducibility, stability, and selectivity were realized with an adsorption capacity of 550.84\u00a0ng/mg. AOH extraction in three edible herbs showed good resistance to matrix interference with recovery rates from 86% to 111%. In combination with AMNPs and the automatic purification instrument, high-throughput and labor-free extraction of AOH in different complex matrices was achieved, which could be extended in other complex matrices."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Quality Standard and Testing Technology, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ruiqi", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Quality Standard and Testing Technology, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Liping", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Technology, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Fengchao", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Technology, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2661-9664"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Quality Standard and Testing Technology, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Luan", "ForeName": "Yunxia", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9943-7218"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Weijun", "Initials": "W"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "KJCX20220410", "Agency": "the Science and Technology Innovation Special Construction Funded Program of Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "KJCX20230437", "Agency": "the Science and Technology Innovation Special Construction Funded Program of Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "KJCX20230309", "Agency": "Construction Project of Science and Technology Innovation Capacity of Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "SKLTCM2022022", "Agency": "the Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Sep Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101088554", "ISSNLinking": "1615-9306"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "KN9L4260JW", "NameOfSubstance": "alternariol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnetite Nanoparticles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mycotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligonucleotides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetite Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mycotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oligonucleotides"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Solid Phase Extraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lactones"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Mujahid C, Savoy MC, Basl\u00e9 Q, Woo PM, Ee ECY, Mottier P, et\u00a0al.
