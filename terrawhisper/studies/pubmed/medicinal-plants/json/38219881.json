'Over-representation' refers to the phenomenon whereby the proportion of plants belonging to a taxonomic group is higher in ethnobotanical pharmacopoeia than in the total flora.", "This study aimed to use the Imprecise Dirichlet Model (IDM) to analyse data from ten southern African countries to establish how over-represented medicinal plant families compare with over-represented genera, how over-represented medicinal taxa differ among countries in this region of Africa, and how over-represented taxa differ among six major disease categories.", "Floral data for the total species composition of each country were obtained from online databases. Medicinal plant species lists were generated from published surveys, inventories, and books. IDM calculations were executed using the inverse of the cumulative beta probability density function in Microsoft Excel\u2122. Python programming language source code was used to calculate Pearson correlation (r) values and Jaccard coefficients (J).", "Nine of forty-two over-represented medicinal plant families in southern Africa (group 1) do not have over-represented genera. Seven of the forty genera with the highest margins of over-representation belong to under-represented families. Nineteen of the forty-two over-represented families have margins of over-representation smaller than the cumulative margins of their over-represented genera. Groups of countries with similar overall flora (J\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.333) are Botswana and Namibia (group 2), Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe (group 3). The families and genera with the highest margins of over-representation are Loganiaceae and Albizia in group 1, Combretaceae and Vachellia in group 2, Dioscoreaceae and Senna in group 3, and Sapotaceae and Solanum in group 4 (South Africa). The families and genera with the highest margins of over-representation across disease categories are Ebenaceae and Albizia, Canellaceae and Dicoma, Combretaceae and Pterocelastrus, Ebenaceae and Bersama, Francoaceae and Erythrina, and Aristolochiaceae and Strychnos for plants used in the treatment of STIs, febrile and mosquito-vector diseases, microbial infections, pain, skin conditions, and female sexual/reproductive problems, respectively.", "Genus-level calculations are more efficient in generating taxonomic lists that can be used for ethnopharmacological investigations due to the exclusion of under-represented genera. Limiting the size of geographical areas from which medicinal plant lists are sampled and targeting plants used to treat specific types of disease prevents the underestimation of niche over-represented taxa."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
