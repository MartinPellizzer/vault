An assessment of the anti-oxidant properties of all extracts was performed using DPPH and ABTS<sup>+</sup> assays. We also investigated the anti-cholinesterase, anti-xanthine oxidase and cytotoxic (against MCF-7 and OVCAR) activities.", "The study of the phytochemical composition showed that the extracts are rich in phenolics (5.38-315.65\u202fmg GAE/g dw) and tannin (0.7-73.8\u202fmg CE/g dw). Also, the results showed that the chemical composition as well as the biological activities varies considerably between regions. The DPPH and ABTS<sup>+</sup> assays revealed that the highest important antioxidant activity was in the methanolic extract for all localities (IC50: 14.8-16.5\u202fmg/l and 6.4-22.23\u202fmg/l, respectively). However, the various extracts had moderate anti-cholinesterase activity (7.52-45.36%) at 50\u202fmg/l. Regarding the xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity, ethyl acetate extract exhibited a moderate activity at a 50\u202fmg/l. The highest cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 and OVCAR was recorded in the ethyl acetate extract of Fernana region (70.1% and 70.8% inhibition at 50\u202fmg/l, respectively). The analysis of HPLC-UV indicates the presence of several phenolic compounds in different extracts of T. hirsuta, possibly accounting for its biological properties.", "The phenolic contents were highly correlated to anti-oxidant activity with very high correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) values. The findings show that the extracts are rich in antioxidant compounds and this plant may be used as a natural source of bioactive compounds with high anti-oxidant and potential anticancer activities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier GmbH.
