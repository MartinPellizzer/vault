The microscopic characteristics of D. officinale powder were examined under a microscopy and described. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) method was used for qualitative analysis of the violanthin from D. officinale stems with a mixture of ethyl acetate, butanone, formic acid and water (4\u22363\u22361\u22361) as the developing solvent on high performance silica gel precoated plate (SGF254) and using aluminium trichloride as a chromagenic agent. The results showed significant characteristics of violanthin from D. officinale stems on TLC, with certain specificity, and could be used to distinguish it from other easily confusing processed medicinal stems of D. devonianum, D. gratiosissimum and D. aphyllum. The content of naringenin, an active ingredient in D. officinale stems was determined by HPLC analysis on a Bischoff Chromatography HIPAK NC-04 ODS AB column (4.4 mm\u00d7250 mm, 5 mm) with acetonitrile-0.1% phosphoric acid solution as the mobile phase for gradient elution. The wavelength was set at 226 nm and column temperature was 25 \u2103. The HPLC method showed good linearity within the range of 3.90-250.00 g\u2022mL\u207b\u00b9 (r = 0.999 9) for naringenin. The average recovery of naringenin was 99.20% with 0.17% of RSD. The mass fraction of 20 batches of D. officinale stems was between 0.190 and 0.498 mg\u2022g\u207b\u00b9. The established qualitative and quantitative method was simple and rapid with good repeatability and accuracy, providing experimental basis for improving the quality standard of D. officinale, with a very important significance to ensure its quality and clinical effect."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM), the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Standardization of Chinese Medicine, State Administration of TCM Key Laboratory for New Resources and Quality Evaluation of Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai R&D Center for Standardization of Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Zi", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM), the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Standardization of Chinese Medicine, State Administration of TCM Key Laboratory for New Resources and Quality Evaluation of Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai R&D Center for Standardization of Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM), the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Standardization of Chinese Medicine, State Administration of TCM Key Laboratory for New Resources and Quality Evaluation of Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai R&D Center for Standardization of Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Ya-Fu", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM), the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Standardization of Chinese Medicine, State Administration of TCM Key Laboratory for New Resources and Quality Evaluation of Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai R&D Center for Standardization of Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM), the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Standardization of Chinese Medicine, State Administration of TCM Key Laboratory for New Resources and Quality Evaluation of Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai R&D Center for Standardization of Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zheng-Tao", "Initials": "ZT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28905572", "10.4268/cjcmm20161318"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
