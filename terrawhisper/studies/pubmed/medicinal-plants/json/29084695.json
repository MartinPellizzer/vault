In the present study, the antibacterial capabilities dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, methanol and aqueous extracts of endocarp and exocarp of walnut were determined against two Gram-positive bacteria and one Gram-negative bacteria. The antioxidant activity was screened by 2, 2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. The highest antioxidant activity was observed for methanol extract of endocarp in both methods and it was stronger than positive control butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT). The total phenolic contents were ranging between 34.59 to 68.34mg GAE/g DW. The results revealed that all extracts had antibacterial activity against selected bacteria except aqueous extract. The methanol extract of endocarp presented the highest zone of inhibition against tested pathogens (9-21mm). From the results it is conclude that the methanol extract from endocarp of walnut could be used as a natural preservative ingredient in food and pharmaceutical industries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural products & medicinal plants Research center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moghaddam", "ForeName": "Parastoo Zarghami", "Initials": "PZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural products & medicinal plants Research center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammadi", "ForeName": "Ameneh", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural products & medicinal plants Research center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Feyzi", "ForeName": "Peyman", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural products & medicinal plants Research center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alesheikh", "ForeName": "Peiman", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U38V3ZVV3V", "NameOfSubstance": "ferric chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disk Diffusion Antimicrobial Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Juglans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nuts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29084695"]}}]}
