Quality control of medicinal plants requires analysis of many bioactive compounds present in the plant. C-alkylated flavonoids are an important bioactive subclass of flavonoids. A simple, rapid, sensitive and selective method is presented here for the quantification of bioactive C-alkylated flavonoids. This is the first quantitative method for analysis of C-alkylated flavonoids based on the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) approach so far. This study focuses on method development for quantification of bioactive C-alkylated flavonoids. Quantification of a total of five C-alkylated flavonoids was done employing the MRM approach on an HPLC-QqQ-MS instrument. LODs and LOQs for quantified flavonoids were in the range of 0.41-1.32 and 1.23-3.96\u00a0ng/mL, respectively. Linear calibration curves between 25 and 1500\u00a0ng/mL were obtained with the regression coefficients of \u22650.996. Accuracy (% bias) and precision (% RSD) of the analyses were found to be less than 5%. Developed HPLC-ESI-MS/MS can be employed as a quality control method of plant raw materials."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.
