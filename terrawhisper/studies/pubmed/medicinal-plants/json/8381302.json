The relative ratio of the maximum activity of PFP to that of ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFK) (PFP/PFK ratio) was high in young tissues and decreased with differentiation and ageing of the tissues. The highest level of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate was observed in the youngest part of hypocotyls of V. mungo. The level was markedly decreased with ageing of tissues. The levels of PPi and ATP were also higher in younger parts than in older parts of the hypocotyls, but the ratio of the level of PPi to that of ATP was almost constant in all parts of the hypocotyl. A good correlation was found between the PFP/PFK ratio and the biosynthetic capacity, as estimated from the rate of incorporation of [U-14C]sucrose into ethanol-insoluble macromolecules."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Ochanomizu University, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ashihara", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sato", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biochim Biophys Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0217513", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fructosediphosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "79082-92-1", "NameOfSubstance": "fructose 2,6-diphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphotransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.11", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphofructokinase-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.90", "NameOfSubstance": "pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Fructosediphosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphofructokinase-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphotransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "2", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8381302", "10.1016/0304-4165(93)90126-s", "0304-4165(93)90126-S"]}}]}
