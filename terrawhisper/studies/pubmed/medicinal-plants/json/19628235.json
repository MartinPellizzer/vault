Nerve growth factor (NGF) differentiates PC12 cells into nerves, and these differentiated PC12 cells enter apoptosis when challenged with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). A screening spectrophotometer was used to assay cytotoxicity in these cells; pretreatment with test samples allowed identification of compounds that protected against this neuronal cytotoxicity. The 95% ethanol extract of Phoenix hanceana Naudin var. formosana Beccari. (PH) showed potential neuroprotective activity in these assays. The PH ethanol extract was further fractionated by sequential partitioning with n-hexane, ethyl acetate (EtOAc), n-butanol (n-BuOH), and water. Subsequent rounds of assaying resulted in the isolation of ten constituents, and their structures were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and identified by comparison with previous data as: isoorientin (1), isovitexin (2), veronicastroside (3), luteolin-7-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside (4), isoquercitrin (5), tricin-7-neohesperidoside (6), tricin-7-O-beta-d-gluco-pyranoside (7), (+)-catechin (8), (-)-epicatechin (9), and orientin 7-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside (10). Among these compounds, isovitexin (2), luteolin-7-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside (4) and (+)-catechin (8) showed significant neuroprotective activity in cell viability (WST-8 reduction), anti-apoptosis (Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide double-labeled flow cytometry), and cellular ROS scavenging assays (besides isovitexin (2)), as well as a decreased caspase-8 activity in 6-OHDA-induced PC12 cells. Hence, isovitexin (2), luteolin-7-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside (4), and (+)-catechin (8) protected PC12 cells from 6-OHDA-induced apoptotic neurotoxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Yi-Pei", "Initials": "YP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Genomics and Proteomics Core Laboratory, Department of Medical Research, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung 833, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Tai-Yuan", "Initials": "TY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical Engineering Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu 30011, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tseng", "ForeName": "Hsiang-Wen", "Initials": "HW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan; Center for Reproductive Medicine and Sciences, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei 110, Taiwan.
