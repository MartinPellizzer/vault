Cytotoxicity was determined against HeLa and L929 cells using MTT assay. Further the most potent extract was chromatographed on reverse phase HPLC towards antiplasmodial activity guided purification of metabolites.", "Of the 22 plant species assayed, the highest antiplasmodial activity (Pf3D7IC50 \u2264 5 \u00b5g/ml) was seen in leaf ethanol extracts of Corymbia citriodora (Hook.) K.D.Hill & L.A.S.Johnson, Calotropis procera (Aiton) Dryand. and Annona squamosa L. and bark ethanol extract of Holarrhena pubescens Wall. ex G.Don. Leaf ethanol extract of H. pubescens, bark ethanol extract of Pongamia pinnata (L.) Pierre and whole plant ethanol extract of Partheniumhysterophorus L. showed promising activity (IC50 6-10 \u00b5g/ml). Good antiplasmodial activity (IC50: 11-20 \u00b5g/ml) was observed in leaf ethanol extract of Bryophyllum pinnatum (Lam.) Oken and whole plant ethanol extract of Catharanthus roseus (L.) G.Don. The extracts of plants showing highest to good antiplasmodial activity exhibited HeLa/Pf3D7 selectivity indices of the order of 20-45. Bioassay guided fractionation of P. hysterophorus led to fivefold enrichment of antiplasmodial activities (IC50 ~450 ng/ml) in some fractions.", "These results provide confirmation to the traditional usage of some medicinal plants against malaria in areas around Ranchi, Jharkhand."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
