An aqueous extract of barks was administrated by gavage in single doses of 2.5-12.5 g/kg. General behaviour and mortality were examined for up to 7 days. The sub-chronic toxicity test was performed in rats. The plant extract was administered by daily gavage of 150-600 mg/kg for 42 days. Body weight, food and water intakes were followed weekly. Haematological, biochemical and organ parameters were determined at the end of the 42-day administration.", "In the acute study in mice, oral administration of the aqueous extract of Pterocarpus soyauxii caused dose-dependent general behaviour adverse effects and mortality. The no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of the extract was 5.0 g/kg. The lowest-observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) was 7.5 mg/kg. Mortality increased with the dose, LD(50) was>10.75 g/kg for the mouse. In the sub-chronic study in rats, daily oral administration of the aqueous extract of Pterocarpus soyauxii did not result in death or significant changes in haematological or biochemical parameters, excepted increased hepatic catalase activity (P<0.05) at the dose of 600 mg/kg. No alteration was observed in body weight, food and water intake. Liver, kidney, lung and pancreas histopathology did not reveal morphological alteration.", "The results showed that the aqueous stem bark extract of Pterocarpus soyauxii Taub had very low toxicity in oral acute high dose administration and no toxicity in oral sub-chronic low dose administration and indicate that the plant could be considered safe for oral medication."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
