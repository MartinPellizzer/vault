In the present work, a new flavonoid named (2<i>S</i>,1\u2033<i>R</i>,2\u2033<i>R</i>)-4'-hydroxy-7-methoxy-6-(1,2,3-trihydroxy-3-methyl-butyl)-flavanone (<b>1</b>), along with seven known compounds (<b>2-8</b>) were isolated from the seeds of <i>Cullen corylifolium.</i> Their structures, including the absolute configurations, were determined by the analysis of comprehensive spectroscopic data and computational calculation methods. All isolates were evaluated for their diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) inhibitory activity. Compounds <b>1-4</b> exhibited different level of DGAT1 inhibitory activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 28.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 to 127.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9\u2009\u03bcM.
