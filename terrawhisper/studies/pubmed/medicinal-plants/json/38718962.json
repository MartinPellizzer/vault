However, the toxicity of these compounds on medicinal plants and their differential effects on plant morphophysiology remain unclear. This study supplemented soils with MPs sized at 200\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0at a rate of 1% w/w and incubated them for 50 days to investigate the impact of MPs on the growth and metabolites of dandelion (Taraxacum mongolicum Hand.-Mazz.). The results demonstrated that the investigated MPs decreased the growth of dandelion seedlings, induced oxidative stress, and altered the activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase). Based on the comprehensive toxicity assessment results, the ecological toxicity was in the following order: PE MPs\u00a0>\u00a0PBAT MPs\u00a0>\u00a0PLA MPs. Metabolomics analyses revealed metabolic reprogramming in dandelion plants, leading to the enrichment of numerous differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) in the leaves. These pathways include carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, suggesting that dandelions respond to MP stress by enhancing the activity of sugar, organic acid, and amino acid metabolic pathways. In addition, phenolic acids and flavonoids are critical for maintaining the balance in the antioxidant defense system. Our results provide substantial insights into the toxicity of biodegradable MPs to plants and shed light on plant defense and adaptation strategies. Further assessment of the safety of biodegradable MPs in terrestrial ecosystems is essential to provide guidance for environmentally friendly management."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
