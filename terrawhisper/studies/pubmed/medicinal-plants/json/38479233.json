They serve as both a defense response during pathogen attack and a valuable drug resource. The role of microorganisms in the regulation of plant secondary metabolism has been widely recognized. The addition of specific microorganisms can increase the synthesis of secondary metabolites, and their beneficial effects depend on environmental factors and plant-related microorganisms. This article summarizes the impact and regulatory mechanisms of different microorganisms on the main secondary metabolic products of plants. We emphasize the mechanisms by which microorganisms regulate hormone levels, nutrient absorption, the supply of precursor substances, and enzyme and gene expression to promote the accumulation of plant secondary metabolites. In addition, the possible negative feedback regulation of microorganisms is discussed. The identification of additional unknown microbes and other driving factors affecting plant secondary metabolism is essential. The prospects for further analysis of medicinal plant genomes and the establishment of a genetic operation system for plant secondary metabolism research are proposed. This study provides new ideas for the use of microbial resources for biological synthesis research and the improvement of crop anti-inverse traits for the use of microbial resources."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier GmbH.
