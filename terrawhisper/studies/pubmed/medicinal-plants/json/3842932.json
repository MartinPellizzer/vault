In order to improve the overall quality of the product, chickpea was processed by different methods prior to its incorporation. A number of formulations was prepared by mixing 52% rice, 30% each, the processed chickpea sample, and 18% whole milk powder. These mixtures were processed by extrusion cooking or drum drying. In the case of the extrusion cooking method, from the nutritional and technological points of view, it was found advantageous to incorporate milk powder after cooking a mixture of rice and chickpea. The values of net protein ratio (NPR) of the products developed, whether processed by extrusion cooking or drum-drying methods, were statistically equal, and not significantly different from those of casein. Supplementing the product with methionine and threonine showed no effect in improving the NPR value, suggesting that these amino acids were not limiting. There were slight differences in the digestibilities of proteins in the products developed and all were lower than that of casein. Depending on the processing method, differences were observed in paste viscosities of the products. After partial hydrolysis of the products with pounds amylase, both the cold and hot paste viscosities were greatly reduced and were comparable with those of whole milk powder. From the results herein reported, it can be concluded that the drum-dried product prepared using rice:chickpea (carbonate presoaked):milk (52:30:18) is the best of all the products developed. Its amino acid composition compares favorably with that of the milk proteins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khaleque", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "El\u00edas", "ForeName": "L G", "Initials": "LG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "G\u00f3mez-Brenes", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Braham", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bressani", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Milk Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Infant Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Milk Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3842932"]}}]}
