Seeking alternatives through medicinal plants could have a great merit in overcoming these deleterious effects. This study was designed to investigate the potential mechanism of curcumin (CUR) in modifying the depression-like behaviour in ovariectomised (OVX) rats, inference with fluoxetine (FLX) and oestradiol (E<sub>2</sub> ). The treatments of OVX rats started after 1\u00a0month post ovariectomy and proceeded for 1\u00a0month. The experimental animals were divided into five groups: sham-operated, OVX-, OVX-FLX (20\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> , i.p., daily), OVX-E<sub>2</sub> (100\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> , i.m., every other day), and OVX-CUR- (100\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> , p.o., daily) treated groups. The results showed that CUR modulated the depression-like behaviour using forced swimming test. It improved the serotonin content in many brain regions by upregulating tryptophan hydroxylase-2 and 5-hydroxytryptamine<sub>1A,2A</sub> receptor messenger RNA (mRNA) and downregulating monoamine oxidase A mRNA in the limbic system. Furthermore, it upregulated aromatase, brain-derived neurotropic factor mRNA, and extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 protein in the limbic system, relative to FLX and E<sub>2,</sub> compared with OVX group. In conclusion, CUR appears to be safe and efficient agent as serotonin modulator similar to FLX and neurotrophic agent like E<sub>2</sub> , in improving the depression-like behaviour in OVX rats."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8589-1556"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of hormone, National Organization for Drug Control and Research, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abd-Rabo", "ForeName": "Marwa M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, National Organization for Drug Control and Research, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Georgy", "ForeName": "Gehan S", "Initials": "GS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of hormone, National Organization for Drug Control and Research, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Saied", "ForeName": "Nashwa M", "Initials": "NM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of hormone, National Organization for Drug Control and Research, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "Wafaa A", "Initials": "WA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "01K63SUP8D", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluoxetine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4TI98Z838E", "NameOfSubstance": "Estradiol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IT942ZTH98", "NameOfSubstance": "Curcumin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Curcumin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depression"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Estradiol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fluoxetine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Neuronal Plasticity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ovariectomy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swimming"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30575146", "10.1002/ptr.6232"]}}]}
