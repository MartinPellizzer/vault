The treatment of cerebrovascular disease by using herbal medicine has been applied for a long time, from which large amounts of medical experience and knowledge have been accumulated. Numerous natural bioactive compounds extracted from Chinese medicines exhibit neuroprotective activities, especially protecting the brain from ischemic injury. This review summarizes the mechanisms underlying cerebral ischemic pathophysiology, including excitotoxicity, generation of free radical, inflammation, astrocytic influence, apoptosis, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and discusses neuroprotective activities of the representative natural bioactive compounds extracted from traditional medicinal herbs, with targeting one or more signal molecules. Confirmation of potential neuroprotective activities of bioactive compounds derived from Chinese medicine in ischemic stroke treatment is discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Yu et al.
