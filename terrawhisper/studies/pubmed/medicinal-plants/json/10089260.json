St. John's Wort for the treatment of depression, chromium for improvement of abnormal glucose and insulin regulation, and garlic for hypercholesterolemia, are among the more popular nutritional supplements being used by the population at large for their respective conditions. Depression, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia are common to the renal patient. However, the efficacy of St. John's Wort, chromium, and garlic for these problems in the patient with impaired renal function is not known. This article reviews the pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and pharmokinetics of these three food supplements in the nonrenal patient. There are encouraging data suggesting successful treatment in the otherwise normal individual. However, clinical studies examining the safety of these three supplements for the treatment of depression, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia in the patient with renal disease are lacking and preclude recommendation of their use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Global Safety and Epidemiology, Wyeth-Ayerst Research, St Davids, PA, USA."}], "LastName": "Duncan", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Ren Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "9112938", "ISSNLinking": "1051-2276"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picolinic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QZV2W997JQ", "NameOfSubstance": "picolinic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["complications", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depression"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Nephropathies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ericales"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypercholesterolemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacokinetics", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Picolinic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "16"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10089260", "10.1016/s1051-2276(99)90001-8", "S1051227699000072"]}}]}
