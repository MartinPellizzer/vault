In the present work, the fresh materials were processed by smoking, sun-drying, shade-drying and oven-drying at low, moderate and high temperatures. To facilitate the selection of a suitable drying method for rhubarb, the quality of rhubarb processed under various drying conditions was evaluated based on the simultaneous determination of multiple bioactive constituents in combination with bioactivity assays.", "The total concentrations of 12 compounds in smoked rhubarb were higher than the concentrations of the same components in raw rhubarb and rhubarb products processed using other drying techniques. Smoked rhubarb was found to substantially inhibit Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup> -ATPase and thrombin. In addition, higher content of anthraquinones led to higher Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup> -ATPase inhibitory activities, and higher gallic acid content increased the antithrombin capacity.", "The results confirmed that post-harvest fresh plant materials, especially roots, were still physiologically active organs that could undergo series of anti-dehydration mechanisms, including the production of related secondary metabolites during the early stages of dehydration. Therefore, the proper design of drying processes could enhance the quality of rhubarb as well as other similar medicinal plants. \u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8801-5562"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, 300193, PR China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jiachen", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, 300193, PR China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yueting", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300072, PR China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Shengjie", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300072, PR China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0050-501X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, 300193, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300072, PR China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wenyuan", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthraquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antithrombins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smoke"}, {"RegistryNumber": "632XD903SP", "NameOfSubstance": "Gallic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Thrombin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 7.2.2.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Anthraquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antithrombins"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Desiccation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Gallic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rheum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smoke"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Thrombin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29315599", "10.1002/jsfa.8871"]}}]}
