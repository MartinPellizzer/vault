A phytochemical study on the whole plants of H. hengshanense W. T. Wang, a species endemic to China, led to the isolation and elucidation of 25 monoterpenoid acylphloroglucinols (MAPs). Among them, 10 are undescribed compounds, namely hyphengshanols A-D, (+)-empetrilatinol A, (-)-empetrilatinol B, (-)-hyperjovinol A, (9S,2'S)-dauphinol F, and (8R,2'S)-empetrikathiforin. In addition, the absolute configurations of other six compounds were firstly determined in the current study. The structures were established by ultraviolet (UV), high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrum (HR-ESI-MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) data. The absolute configurations were determined by experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD) data analyses. Cytotoxicity assays on five human cell lines HL-60, A549, SMMC-7721, MDA-MB-231, and SW480 revealed that 16 compounds exhibited broad-spectrum antiproliferative activities with IC<sub>50</sub> ranging from 7.54 to 45.70\u00a0\u03bcM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
