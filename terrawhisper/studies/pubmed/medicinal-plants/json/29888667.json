Furthermore, eight different Gram-negative and Gram-positive multidrug-resistant bacterial strains were used to investigate the antibacterial potential of the essential oil. The antibacterial activity was tested using MIC and MBC microdilution method, well and disc diffusion in different concentration. The hydro-distillation of aerial parts powder yield was 0.466% (v/w). Essential oil showed bactericidal activity against both MDR Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains. MIC and MBC results were ranged from 0.31 to 2.5 and 0.62 to 5.0 mg/mL. The inhibition zones in well-diffusion method were ranged from 7 \u00b1 0.6 mm to 15 \u00b1 1.0 mm. Disc diffusion method was ranged from 7 \u00b1 0.0 mm to 16 \u00b1 0.6 mm depending on the type of bacteria strain and essential oil concentration. Essential oil of Ch. album had the greatest potential to be considered as an antibacterial agent against MDR bacteria strain. This potential was due to different biological and bioactive compounds like phytol, linalool, \u03b1-terpineol and linolenic acid in the plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Chemistry, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Khomarlou", "ForeName": "Negin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Chemistry, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Aberoomand-Azar", "ForeName": "Parviz", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Medicinal Plants Processing Research Center, Shiraz University of Medicinal Sciences , Shiraz , Iran."}], "LastName": "Lashgari", "ForeName": "Ardalan Pasdaran", "Initials": "AP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Research Center for Prevention of Oral and Dental Disease, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4 Nanobiotechnology Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Tebyanian", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "5 Faculty Member of Production and Research Complex, Pasteur Institute of Iran , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Hakakian", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "6 Molecular Biology Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Ranjbar", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "7 Phytochemistry Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medicinal Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Ayatollahi", "ForeName": "Seyed Abdolmajid", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Hungary", "MedlineTA": "Acta Biol Hung", "NlmUniqueID": "8404358", "ISSNLinking": "0236-5383"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexane Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0RBV727H71", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Linolenic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "150-86-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "21334LVV8W", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-terpineol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D81QY6I88E", "NameOfSubstance": "linalool"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chenopodium album"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexane Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Negative Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Positive Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytol"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Linolenic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29888667", "10.1556/018.69.2018.2.4"]}}]}
