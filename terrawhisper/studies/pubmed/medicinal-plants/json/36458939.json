Architecturally, compound 1 represents the first PPAP with an unprecedented 8/6/5/6/5 pentacyclic skeleton and an intramolecular peroxy bridge, which might be derived from the [3.3.1]-type bicyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol <i>via</i> the critical Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, decarboxylation, and intramolecular cyclization. The structures were established by extensive spectroscopic analysis, ACD software calculation, and quantum chemical computations. A plausible biogenetic pathway of 1 and 2 was also proposed. Importantly, both compounds exhibited moderate cytotoxic activities against the HEL cell line with the IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 10.2 to 19.2 \u03bcM. Moreover, compound 1 showed an inhibitory effect on NO production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 cells at a lower concentration of 5 or 1 \u03bcM."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
