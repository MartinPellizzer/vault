In this study, we examined the antitumor effect of the medicinal plant Nigella sativa on the morphology, survival, and apoptosis of ACHN (human renal adenocarcinoma) and GP-293 (normal renal epithelial) cell lines. From a hydroalcoholic extract of N.\u00a0sativa, n-hexane and ethyl acetate fractions were extracted. Cells were treated with various concentrations of total hydroalcholic extract and n-hexane and ethyl acetate fractions; cell viability, morphological changes, and apoptosis were then determined. Results were presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard error of the mean (SEM). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied for the statistical analysis of the data. The total extract and the fractions in a dose- and time-dependent manner reduced the cell viability in ACHN with no effect on the GP-293 cell line. In addition, the total extract resulted in more morphological changes in the ACHN cells compared to the GP-293 cells. The effect of the total extract in inducing apoptosis after 48 hours in the ACHN cell line was greater than in GP-293. In addition, the effect of the two fractions was lower than the total extract at all used concentrations. Therefore, the effect of total extract and n-hexane and ethyl acetate fractions of N.\u00a0sativa on cell viability and apoptosis in the ACHN cell line is greater than in the GP-293 cell line. However, the effect of the total extract is higher than either of the two fractions on their own."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shahraki", "ForeName": "Samira", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Centre and Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khajavirad", "ForeName": "Abolfazl", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurocognetive Research Center and Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shafei", "ForeName": "Mohammad Naser", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahmoudi", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tabasi", "ForeName": "Nafisa Sadat", "Initials": "NS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Tradit Complement Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101605474", "ISSNLinking": "2225-4110"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Nickavar B., Mojab F., Javidnia K., Amoli M.R.
