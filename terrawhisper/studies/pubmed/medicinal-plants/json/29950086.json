We summarized Herbal textual research of \"Xishuang\" phenomenon of six herbs, such as Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus, Moutan Cortex, Atractylodis Rhizoma, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, dried persimmon frost and watermelon frost. From historical perspective, cream of Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus was firstly discovered in Lei Gong's Moxibustion Theory. Thereafter, dried persimmon frost was found in Song Dynasty, which was named \"white persimmon\" in Ben Cao Tu Jing and had become an independent medicine in Compendium of Materia Medica. Then, watermelon frost was found in Yang Yi Da Quan of the Qing Dynasty, and Moutan Cortex's \"sand star\" was recorded in Zeng Ding Wei Yao Tiao Bian of the Republic of China. After that, \"Xishuang\" phenomenon of Atractylodis Rhizomaand Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex were reported in 1950s and 1960s in succession. The pattern of \"Xishuang\" is divided into different type, natural \"Xishuang\" includes Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus, Moutan Cortex, Atractylodis Rhizoma and Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, artificial \"Xishuang\" includes watermelon frost, and dried persimmon frost formed crystals by using artificial intervention. The above 6 kinds of herbs have different crystal structure and chemical composition. Therefore, according to traditional identification experience, \"Xishuang\" phenomenon is related to varieties and quality of medicinal herbs. These research provide herbalism basis for the modern study of \"Xishuang\" medicinal materials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Da-Qing", "Initials": "DQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Conservation and Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Zha", "ForeName": "Liang-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Conservation and Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Hua-Sheng", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "moutan cortex"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atractylodes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diospyros"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnolia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Paeonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Schisandra"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29950086", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180329.011"]}}]}
