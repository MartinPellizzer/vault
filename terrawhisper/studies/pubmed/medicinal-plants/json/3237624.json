On the other hand, 28.45% of the total vicine (vicine & convicine) present in the whole faba bean samples was extracted after soaking for 72 h at room temperature. Subsequently, other soaking mediums, i.e., 0.5% sodium carbonate and/or 1% acetic acid were used in an attempt to increase the level of vicine elimination. Percentage removal of total vicine in whole faba bean was higher in the acidic (61.31%) than the alkaline (38.40%) medium under the conditions tested, i.e., at room temperature for 72 hours. The rates of vicine + convicine elimination in decorticated faba bean for the acidic acid and alkaline soaking media were 78.46 and 79.13%, respectively. The solubility ratio of total vicine relative to soaking solutions (H2O:Na2CO3:Acetic acid) was 1:1.35:2.16 in the whole broad bean and 1:2.41:2.39 in the decorticated samples. The residual amounts of total vicine (78.33% and 77.27%) present after stewing under normal and under pressure cooking conditions could be expected to be decreased to 30.33% for the former and 29.92% for the later after 72 h of soaking. Regression analysis was used to estimate the theoretical zero point of vicine elimination from faba bean through soaking in 1% acetic acid."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Science Dept., Faculty of Agriculture, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abd Allah", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Foda", "ForeName": "Y H", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abu Salem", "ForeName": "F M", "Initials": "FM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abd Allah", "ForeName": "Z S", "Initials": "ZS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrimidinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "COL14PJW3X", "NameOfSubstance": "vicine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Egypt"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Favism"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrimidinones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1953 Nov;12 (3):462-77", "ArticleIdList": ["13115456"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3237624", "10.1007/BF01092859"]}}]}
