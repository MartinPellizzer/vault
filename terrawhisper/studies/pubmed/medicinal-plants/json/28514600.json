Orchids are in high demand owing to their beautiful flowers and therapeutic properties. Overexploitation and habitat destruction have made many orchid species endangered. In the absence of effective identification methods, illicit trade of orchids continues unabated. Considering DNA barcoding as a potential identification tool, species discrimination capability of five loci, ITS, matK, rbcL, rpoB, and rpoC1, was tested in 393 accessions of 94 Indian orchid species belonging to 47 genera, including one listed in Appendix I of CITES and 26 medicinal species. ITS provided the highest species discrimination rate of 94.9%. While, among the chloroplast loci, matK provided the highest species discrimination rate of 85.7%. None of the tested loci individually discriminated 100% of the species. Therefore, multi-locus combinations of up to five loci were tested for their species resolution capability. Among two-locus combinations, the maximum species resolution (86.7%) was provided by ITS+matK. ITS and matK sequences of the medicinal orchids were species specific, thus providing unique molecular identification tags for their identification and detection. These observations emphasize the need for the inclusion of ITS in the core barcode for plants, whenever required and available."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Botany, University of Delhi, Delhi 110007, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b National Centre for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, Oxford, MS 38677, USA."}], "LastName": "Parveen", "ForeName": "Iffat", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Botany, University of Delhi, Delhi 110007, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Hemant K", "Initials": "HK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Botany, University of Delhi, Delhi 110007, India."}], "LastName": "Malik", "ForeName": "Saloni", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India."}], "LastName": "Raghuvanshi", "ForeName": "Saurabh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Botany, University of Delhi, Delhi 110007, India."}], "LastName": "Babbar", "ForeName": "Shashi B", "Initials": "SB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Genome", "NlmUniqueID": "8704544", "ISSNLinking": "0831-2796"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Amplification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Orchidaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28514600", "10.1139/gen-2016-0215"]}}]}
