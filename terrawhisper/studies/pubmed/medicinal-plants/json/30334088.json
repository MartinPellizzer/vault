However, the precise response of the microbial community has remained largely unknown. To explore the reasons, bacterial communities in ammonia-stressed reactors and control reactors were studied by amplicon pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes and the active methanogens were followed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses of mcrA/mrtA gene transcripts. The results showed that the diversity of bacterial communities decreased in two parallel ammonia-inhibited reactors compared with two control reactors, but different levels of inhibitions coinciding with different community shifts were observed. In one reactor, the process was completely inhibited, which was preceded by a decreasing relative abundance of the phylum Firmicutes. Despite the same operating conditions, the process was stabilized in the parallel, partially inhibited reactor, in which the relative abundance of Firmicutes greatly increased. In particular, both ammonia-inhibited reactors lacked taxa assumed to be syntrophic bacteria (Thermoanaerobacteraceae, Syntrophomonadaceae, and Synergistaceae). Besides the predominance of the hydrogenotrophic methanogens Methanoculleus and Methanobacterium, activity of Methanosarcina and even of the strictly aceticlastic genus Methanosaeta were found to contribute at very high ammonia levels (>\u20099\u00a0g NH<sub>4</sub>-N\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) in the stabilized reactor (partial inhibition). In contrast, the lack of aceticlastic activity in the parallel reactor might have led to acetate accumulation and thus process failure (complete inhibition). Collectively, ammonia was found to be a general inhibitor while accumulating acetate and thus acidification might be the key factor of complete process failure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province, Jiangsu Normal University, Shanghai Road 101, Xuzhou, 221116, China. zuopenglv@126.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Microbiology, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, Permoserstrasse 15, 04318, Leipzig, Germany. zuopenglv@126.com."}], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Zuopeng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Microbiology, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, Permoserstrasse 15, 04318, Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Leite", "ForeName": "Athaydes Francisco", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Microbiology, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, Permoserstrasse 15, 04318, Leipzig, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig, Deutscher Platz 5e, 04103, Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Harms", "ForeName": "Hauke", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Microbiology, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, Permoserstrasse 15, 04318, Leipzig, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Biological Sciences Applied Ecology and Phycology, University of Rostock, Albert-Einstein-Str. 3, D-18059, Rostock, Germany."}], "LastName": "Glaser", "ForeName": "Karin", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemical Conversion, Deutsches Biomasseforschungszentrum gemeinn\u00fctzige GmbH (DBFZ), Torgauer Strasse 116, 04347, Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Liebetrau", "ForeName": "Jan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Microbiology, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, Permoserstrasse 15, 04318, Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Kleinsteuber", "ForeName": "Sabine", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Microbiology, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, Permoserstrasse 15, 04318, Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Nikolausz", "ForeName": "Marcell", "Initials": "M"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "51708264", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Appl Microbiol Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8406612", "ISSNLinking": "0175-7598"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biofuels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodiversity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofuels"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Consortia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30334088", "10.1007/s00253-018-9444-0", "10.1007/s00253-018-9444-0"]}}]}
