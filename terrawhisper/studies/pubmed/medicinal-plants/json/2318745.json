Adhesion of Candida spp. to BEC was significantly reduced after both short and long time exposure of yeast to AGE. A similar inhibition of adherence was observed upon preincubation of BEC with AGE. The adherence-inhibition activity of AGE treatment was antagonized by thiols such as L-cysteine, glutathione and 2-mercaptoethanol. In addition, germ-tube formation was suppressed when C. albicans cells were pretreated with AGE. There was a significant reduction in the adherence of yeasts to BEC collected immediately or 15 min after an oral rinse with AGE. No statistical significance in the adhesion of BEC collected 30 min after oral rinse with AGE and control BEC was observed. The diminished adherence of C. albicans to BEC after exposure to various concentrations of garlic may have clinical relevance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Kuwait University, Safat."}], "LastName": "Ghannoum", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Bacteriol", "NlmUniqueID": "7503050", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8847"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mouthwashes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Candida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouthwashes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2318745", "10.1111/j.1365-2672.1990.tb02562.x"]}}]}
