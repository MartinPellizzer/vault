However, sophisticated and laborious data analysis is required to identify chemical components, especially new compounds, from a large LC-MS dataset. The aim of this study is to develop an integrated data-mining strategy that combines molecular networking (MN), in-house polygonal mass defect filtering (MDF), and diagnostic fragment ion filtering (DFIF) to identify phytochemicals in Stephania tetrandra based on LC-MS data. S. tetrandra samples were prepared by matrix solid-phase dispersion extraction methods and then raw MS spectra were acquired using LC-QTOF-MS/MS. MN and in-house polygonal MDF classified the compounds roughly. Modified DFIF were then used in succession to place each spectrum into a specific class. Finally, the exact structures were deduced by fragmentation pathways and related botanical biogenesis, with the help of the narrowed classification from MN and MDF. The total workflow was a combination of data filtering and identification methods for rapid characterization of known compounds (dereplication) and discovery of new compounds. Consequently, 144 compounds were identified or tentatively identified in the aerial parts and roots of S. tetrandra, including 11 potentially new compounds and 63 compounds first identified in this species. Among 144 compounds, 61 were from the aerial parts exclusively, 8 were from the roots exclusively, and 75 were found in both parts. Furthermore, two new biflavonoids were isolated with the guide of LC-MS analysis and structurally elucidated by spectroscopic methods. In conclusion, the proposed data-mining strategy based on LC-MS can be used to profile chemical constituents with high efficiency and guide the isolation of new compounds from medicinal plants. The comparison of the components of the aerial parts and roots of S. tetrandra would be helpful for the rational utilization of the medicinal plant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
