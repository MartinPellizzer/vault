Research contents included course beginning years, majors, class hours, characteristics of the course, teaching ways, the theory and practice contents, evaluation modes, selection of teaching material, teaching achievements, teachers and so on for undergraduates and graduates. Research results showed that with 20 years' development, Molecular Pharmacognosy had been offered for both undergraduate and graduate students in at least 20 colleges and universities and Molecular Pharmacognosy education in China showed good development momentum. At the same time, to promote the development of Molecular Pharmacognosy further, investment for it should be increased and practical teaching condition should be improved."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bi", "ForeName": "Yu-xia", "Initials": "YX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Hai-yu", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Shu-zhen", "Initials": "SZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hai-yan", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chang-xiao", "Initials": "CX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["education", "methods", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Biology"}, {"QualifierName": ["education", "methods", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacognosy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Teaching"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Workforce"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26978972"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
