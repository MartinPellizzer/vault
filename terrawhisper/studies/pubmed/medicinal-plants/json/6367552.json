Those concerning the Middle Ages were virtually non-existent. Paragraphs were found scattered in various chapters of 10th and 11th century medical and surgical works dealing with the anaesthetic techniques required by the importance of the surgical operations carried out at the time, such as above- or through-knee amputations. Avicenna, an 11th century arab doctor, has written several medical works. The most famous one, the Canon, did play an important part in medical teaching of the Middle Ages. This book included about forty plants considered to have anaesthetic properties; a detailed description of the preparation of drugs from these plants and of way in which these drugs were used was given. It seemed the dangers of these drugs were known. Examples from this book made it possible to understand better the anaesthetic practice of the time, so giving a general idea of anaesthesia in the Middle Ages."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hijazi", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Biography", "English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "L'anesth\u00e9sie chez Avicenne et les techniques anesth\u00e9siques au XIe si\u00e8cle."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Ann Fr Anesth Reanim", "NlmUniqueID": "8213275", "ISSNLinking": "0750-7658"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Anesthesiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Medieval"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Arabic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "PersonalNameSubjectList": [{"LastName": "Avicenna"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6367552", "10.1016/s0750-7658(84)80105-7", "S0750-7658(84)80105-7"]}}]}
