In current study,we aimed to propose a new strategy for fast chemical characterization of HM by using reversed phase liquid chromatography-hydrophilic interaction chromatography-predictive multiple reaction monitoring( RPLC-HILIC-p MRM),and Artemisiae Scopariae Herba was employed in this study to illustrate the entire strategy. In response to wide polarity spanning of the diverse chemical clusters in Artemisiae Scopariae Herba,RPLC and HILIC were coupled in series to retain and separate hydrophilic and hydrophobic components simultaneously by identifying the characteristics of chromatographic separation. Most of the chemical constituents in traditional Chinese medicine can be predicted by summarizing the results of chemical constituents of the same genera and introducing primary metabolites and possible substitution reaction types. Therefore,we constructed predictive ion pairs to rapidly identify the chemical constituents of Artemisiae Scopariae Herba. After comparison with control products,discussion on fragmentation pattern,and access to relevant information from literature and databases,a total of 139 components were detected and structurally annotated by matching the obtained spectral data with the information of authentic compounds. Above all,RPLC-HILIC-p MRM could be used as an eligible analytical tool for the chemical profiling of HMs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine,School of Chinese Meteria Medica,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029,China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine,School of Chinese Meteria Medica,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine,School of Chinese Meteria Medica,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029,China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine,School of Chinese Meteria Medica,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine,School of Chinese Meteria Medica,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029,China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yun-Fang", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine,School of Chinese Meteria Medica,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029,China."}], "LastName": "Tu", "ForeName": "Peng-Fei", "Initials": "PF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine,School of Chinese Meteria Medica,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029,China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Yue-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Reverse-Phase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31359675", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190327.001"]}}]}
