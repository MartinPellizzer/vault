Study participants were outpatients on long-term warfarin therapy for at least 2\u00a0months for atrial fibrillation or prosthetic cardiac valves. Interviews were carried out concerning information about the habits of medicinal herb consumption, and logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the consumption of herbs. The scientific names of the medicinal plants were identified to search for information on the effects on the hemostasis of the interactions between the medicinal herbs reported and warfarin.", "The mean age of the 273 patients included was 60.8\u00a0years; 58.7% were women. Medicinal plants were used by 67% of the participants. No association between demographic and clinical data and the use of medicinal plants was identified. Patients reported a total of 64 different plants, primarily consumed in the form of tea. The plants were mainly used to treat respiratory tract and central nervous system disorders. About 40% of the plants cited have been reported to potentially interfere with the anticoagulation therapy, principally by potentiating the effects of warfarin, which could, increase the risk of bleeding.", "The use of medicinal plants was highly common and widespread in patients receiving warfarin as an anticoagulation therapy. Univariate analysis of variables associated with the consumption of herbs showed no statistically significant difference in the consumption of medicinal plants for any of the sociodemographic and clinical data. The medicinal plants that were reportedly consumed by the patients could affect hemostasis. This study reinforces the need for further studies evaluating the habits of patients consuming medicinal plants and their clinical implications, and will help to design strategies to manage the risks associated with warfarin-herbal interactions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8499-5791"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Products, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Av.
