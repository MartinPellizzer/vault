The purpose of this study was to identify the secondary metabolites, to compare anti-inflammatory effects and to determine the quality marker components among root, stem and rhizome sections of IA.", "Chemical fingerprints of stem, root and rhizome of IA was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A reliable method using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) was established for comprehensively determining the chemical constituents of the plants. Anti-inflammatory activities of IA and its ingredients were screened by in vivo mouse ear swelling and in vitro LPS-induced release of NO from RAW264.7 cells experiments.", "Root, stem and rhizome of IA have shown high similarity in chemical fingerprints. Totally 149 compounds were characterized in IA, including triterpenoids, triterpenoid saponins, phenolic acids and lignans. 44 of them were identified based on co-occurring Mass2Motifs, including 19 unreported ones, whilst 17 were tentatively confirmed by comparison with reference compounds. No significant anti-inflammatory activity difference among root, stem and rhizome parts of IA was found. Ilexsaponin B2, protocatechualdehyde, isochlorogenic acid B and quinic acid, were screened out as quality marker compounds in IA.", "A sensitive and rapid strategy was established to evaluate the differences on secondary metabolites of different parts of IA for the first time, and this study may contribute to the quality evaluation of medicinal herbs and provide theoretically data support for further analysis of different parts of IA."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
