The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were assessed spectrophotometrically using microplate and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader.", "Methanolic and ethyl acetate extracts had antibacterial effects against Gram-positive and negative bacteria. Compared to ethyl acetate extract, the methanolic extract showed stronger effects on both Gram-positive and negative bacteria. The most antibacterial effect was related to methanolic extract with a concentration of 500 mg/ml on <i>S. aureus</i> by 14.6 mm inhibition zone. Evidence from MIC also confirmed that the lowest MIC was belonged to methanolic extract by 0.75 mg/ml against <i>S. aureus</i>. Interestingly, both of these extracts showed more antibacterial activity on Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria.", "The investigation proved the efficacy of microalgae extracts isolated from Persian Gulf as natural antimicrobials and suggested the possibility of employing them in medicines as antimicrobial agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Niazi Vahdati et al.
