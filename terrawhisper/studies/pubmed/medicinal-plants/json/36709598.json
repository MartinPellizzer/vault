It may begin early in life and stay latent and asymptomatic for an extended period before its clinical manifestation. The formation of foamy macrophages due to dysregulated lipid metabolism is a key event in the development and progression of atherosclerotic plaque. The current pharmacotherapy for atherosclerosis is not able to address multiple aetiologies associated with the disease. Lipidom, an herbal prescription medicine, has anti-oxidant, lipid lowering and anti-inflammatory properties that lead to multifaceted treatment benefits against chronic inflammation, dyslipidaemia, and oxidative stress. The present study aimed to characterize the pharmacological effects of Lipidom using various experimental models. The phytochemical analysis of Lipidom was performed on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) platform. Lipidom was evaluated for cytosafety, IL-1\u03b2 and MCP-1 release, modulation of NLRP3 pathway, NF\u03baB activity, ROS generation, lipid accumulation and gene expression in THP1 macrophages. Furthermore, Lipidom evaluation was also performed in the N2, CF1553, and TJ356 strains of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). The evaluation of brood size, adult (%), lipid accumulation, triglyceride levels, SOD-3 GFP signal, MDA formation, DAF-16 nuclear translocation, and gene expression was performed in C. elegans. Lipidom treatment significantly reduced the inflammatory mediators, lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and normalized genes involved in the development of foamy macrophages. Lipidom treated C. elegans showed a significant decline in lipid accumulation and oxidative stress. Taken together, Lipidom treatment showed a multifaceted approach in the modulation of several mediators responsible for the development and progression of atherosclerotic plaque."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
