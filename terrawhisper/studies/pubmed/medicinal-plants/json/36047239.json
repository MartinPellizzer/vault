GC-MS analysis identified thirty six phyto-compounds amounting to 98.99% of the total oil. These compounds were classified into eleven groups among which the fatty acid one exhibited the highest intensity (91.63%). Cis, 6-octadecenoic acid was the most abundant compound (70.68%). The triacylglycerol composition of MoSO was characterized by the predominance of the glycerol trioleate (OOO) (32.42\u00b10.12%). Thermogravimetric analysis of MoSO showed that the oil possess an interesting thermal stability with a highly Onset temperatures (T<sub>onset</sub>) of 390.72\u00b0C and 357.47\u00b0C, respectively in nitrogen and air atmospheres. By using the ABTS assay, MoSO exhibited an interesting antioxidant capacity of 365 \u03bcM TEAC. The oil was also endowed with a relatively strong anti-inflammatory activity since its treatment at the different concentrations tested (75, 150 and 300 \u03bcg/mL). However, no antimicrobial activity was observed. On the basis of the obtained results, MoSO could be used in diverse industrial applications such as pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food fields thanks to its thermal stability and interesting biological activities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2600-8011"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physics laboratory of Soft Matter and Electromagnetic Modeling, LR99ES16, Faculty of Science of Tunis, Tunis El Manar University."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire des Interactions Plante Sol Environnement, LR21ES01, Faculty of Science of Tunis, Tunis El Manar University."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Process engineering department, Higher Institute of Technological Studies of Zaghouan, General Direction of Technological Studies."}], "LastName": "Gharsallah", "ForeName": "Karima", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Carthage, National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology, LR11ES26, LIP-MB 'Laboratory of Protein Engineering and Bioactive Molecules'."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "High Institute of Food Industries."}], "LastName": "Rezig", "ForeName": "Leila", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Natural Substances, National Institute of Research and Physico-chemical analyses, Sidi Thabet Technology Center."}], "LastName": "B'chir", "ForeName": "Fatma", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Aromatic and Medicinal Plants, Biotechnology Center of Borj-Cedria Technopole."}], "LastName": "Bourgou", "ForeName": "Soumaya", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Carthage, National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology, LR11ES26, LIP-MB 'Laboratory of Protein Engineering and Bioactive Molecules'."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Jendouba, High Institute of Biotechnology of Beja."}], "LastName": "Achour", "ForeName": "Nahed Ben", "Initials": "NB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Manouba, ISBST."}], "LastName": "Jlassi", "ForeName": "Chaima", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physics laboratory of Soft Matter and Electromagnetic Modeling, LR99ES16, Faculty of Science of Tunis, Tunis El Manar University."}], "LastName": "Soltani", "ForeName": "Taoufik", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire des Interactions Plante Sol Environnement, LR21ES01, Faculty of Science of Tunis, Tunis El Manar University."}], "LastName": "Chalh", "ForeName": "Abdellah", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Oleo Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101175339", "ISSNLinking": "1345-8957"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Moringa oleifera"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36047239", "10.5650/jos.ess22095"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
