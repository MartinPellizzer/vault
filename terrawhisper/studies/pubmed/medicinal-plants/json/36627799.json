In September 2021, a serious leaf spot disease with symptoms similar to anthracnose was extensively observed on T. papyriferus in Shibing county (E 127\u00b012'0\", N 25\u00b011'60\"), Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou province, China. Field surveys were conducted in about 1000 T. papyriferus plants in Shibing in September 2021. The incidence of the leaf spot on leaves was 45% to 60%, significantly reducing the quality of medicinal materials. The symptoms began as small yellow spots, developing a brown center and dark brown to black margin, and eventually the diseased leaves were wiltered and rotted. Symptomatic leaves were collected from 20 trees. Symptomatic tissue from diseased leaves was surface desinfected (0.5 min in 75% ethanol and 1 min in 3% NaOCl, washed three times with sterilized distilled water), small pieces of symptomatic leaf tissue (0.2 \u00d7 0.2 cm) were plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25\u00b0C for about 7 days (Fang. 2007). Three single-spore isolates were obtained (GUTC37, GUTC310 and GUTC311) and deposited in the collection of the Plant Pathology Deparment, College of Agriculture, Guizhou University, China (GUCC) (with the accession numbers, GUCC220241, GUCC220242, GUCC220243 respectively). These isolates were identical in morphology and in the sequences of internal transcribed spacer region [ITS], glyceraldehy-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH], chitin synthase [CHS-1], actin [ACT], and calmodulin [CAL] genes (White et al. 1990; Carbone and Kohn 1999; Templeton et al. 1992). Therefore, the representative isolate GUTC37 was used for further analysis. The pathogenicity of GUTC37 was tested through a pot assay. Plants were inoculated by spraying a spore suspension (106 spores\u00b7ml-1) of isolated strains onto leaves until runoff, and the control leaves sprayed with sterile water. The inoculated plants were incubated in a growth chamber at 28 \u2103 and 95% relative humidity for 10 days. Pathogenicity tests were repeated three times (Fang. 2007). The symptoms developed on the inoculated leaves, while control remained asymptomatic. The lesions were first visible 72 h after inoculation, and typical lesions like those observed on field plants appeared after 10 days. The same fungus was reisolated and identified based on the morphological characterization and molecular analyses from the infected leaves but not from the non-inoculated leaves. Results of pathogenicity experiments of isolated fungi fulfilled Koch's postulates. Fungal colonies on PDA were villiform, creamy-white or greyish, aerial mycelium pale grey, dense, surface partly covered with orange conidial masses. The conidia were abundant, oval-ellipsoid, aseptate, and 13.89 (11.62 to 15.21) \u00d7 5.21 (4.39 to 5.65) \u00b5m (n=50). Appressorium were greyish green, nearly ovoid to cylindrical, 9.64 (6.62 to 14.61) \u00d7 6.33 (5.45-7.72) \u00b5m (n=50). The morphological features were consistent with the descriptions of Colletotrichum fructicola Prihast., L. Cai & K.D. Hyde (Prihastuti et al. 2009). The pathogen was identified to be C. fructicola by amplification and sequencing of the five genes. The sequences of the PCR products were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers OP143657 (ITS), OP177868 (GAPDH), OP177865 (CHS-1), OP278677 (ACT) and OP177862 (CAL). BLAST searches of the obtained sequences revealed 100% (509/509 nucleotides), 99.63% (269/270 nucleotides), 99.31% (287/289 nucleotides), 99.29% (280/282 nucleotides), and 99.86% (728/729 nucleotides) homology with those of C. fructicola in GenBank (JX010165, JX010033, JX009866, FJ907426, and JX009676, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis (MEGA 7.0) using the maximum likelihood method placed the isolate GUTC37 in a well-supported cluster with C. fructicola. To our knowledge, this is the first report of anthracnose on T. papyriferus caused by C. fructicola in Guizhou, China. This study provides valuable information for the identification and control of the anthracnose on T. papyriferus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University, 71206, Agricultural College, Huaxi, Guiyang, China, 550025; 18385282578@163.com."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Xian-Ying", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Agricultural College, 71206, College of Agriculture, HUAXI, Guiyang, China, 550025; 18085459104@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Zhi-Cheng", "Initials": "ZC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University, 71206, Department of Tobacco Science, huaxi, Guiyang, China, 550025."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University, 71206, Department of Plant Pathology,Agriculture, Guiyang, GUIZHOU, China, 550025; 3068312191@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University, 71206, Plant pathology, huaxi, guiyang, GUIZHOU, China, 550025; zhuwenya999@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Wen-Ya", "Initials": "WY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "guiyang, China; 2375847653@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Xue-Ping", "Initials": "XP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University, 71206, Guizhou University, Guiyang, Guiyang, Guizhou, China, 550025; hxding@gzu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Hai-Xia", "Initials": "HX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University, 71206, West Campus of Guizhou University,Huaxi District, Guiyang City, Guizhou Province,China, Guiyang, Guizhou, China, 550025; 296430006@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Li-Juan", "Initials": "LJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "33"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36627799", "10.1094/PDIS-10-22-2366-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
