After 28 days, the rats on the rice-and-bean diets showed significantly higher levels (four times higher) of liver GGT activity and a concomitant 50% lower concentration of liver GSH in comparison with control groups feeding on casein. The addition of DL-methionine to rice-and-bean diets significantly increased the liver GSH content, which reached levels 50% higher than those found in animals on casein diets. The increase in GSH was accompanied by a decrease in liver GGT activity, which did not reach levels as low as those observed in the control groups. No significant correlation could be established between GGT and GSH changes under the present experimental conditions. Linear correlation analysis only revealed that in animals submitted to unsupplemented rice-and-bean diets GSH concentration was positively associated (P < 0.05) with weight gain, food intake and food efficiency. GGT, however, was negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with food intake only, and exclusively for supplemented rice-and-bean diets. The high levels of GGT activity observed in the present study for rats receiving a rice-and-bean mixture could be a result of the poor quality of these diets associated with their deficiency in sulfur amino acids. The results also suggest that diet supplementation with methionine could be important in the reduction of the deleterious effects of GSH depletion by restoring the intracellular concentration of this tripeptide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Enfermagem em Sa\u00fade Coletiva, Escola de Enfermagem, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil. imolise@usp.br"}], "LastName": "De-Oliveira", "ForeName": "I M", "Initials": "IM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fujimori", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pereira", "ForeName": "V G", "Initials": "VG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "De-Castro", "ForeName": "V D", "Initials": "VD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Med Biol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8112917", "ISSNLinking": "0100-879X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caseins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chelating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AE28F7PNPL", "NameOfSubstance": "Methionine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.2.2", "NameOfSubstance": "gamma-Glutamyltransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caseins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chelating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food, Fortified"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Methionine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weaning"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "gamma-Glutamyltransferase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10347814", "10.1590/s0100-879x1999000400017"]}}]}
