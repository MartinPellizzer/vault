These preparations differed from controls (thylakoids from plants grown under 16-h light/8-h dark cycles) in the following respects: 15 times smaller chlorophyll/protein ratio, 10 times greater chlorophyll a/b ratio, absence of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding proteins, and 2-3-fold greater ratio of photosystem II over photosystem I. In addition we found the following: (1) Electrogenic electron transfer around cytochrome b6/f under flashing light was greatly enhanced, probably as a consequence of the greater photosystem II/photosystem I ratio. (2) The rate of proton uptake from the medium at the acceptor side of photosystem II was enhanced, probably by unshielding of the quinone binding domain. (3) The N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide sensitivity of the proton-pumping activity of photosystem II was absent, which was consistent with the attribution of a N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-induced protonic short circuit to chlorophyll a/b binding proteins. (4) The sensitivity of oxygen evolution under continuous light to variations of pH or the concentration of Ca2+ was altered. Chlorophyll a/b binding proteins serve as light-harvesting antennas. We found in addition that they modulated the activity of water oxidation and, in particular, the proteolytic reactions around photosystem II."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biophysik, Fachbereich Biologie/Chemie, Universit\u00e4t Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany."}], "LastName": "Jahns", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Junge", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0370623", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2960"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosystem I Protein Complex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosystem II Protein Complex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5712ZB110R", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorophyll b"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YF5Q9EJC8Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll A"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Intracellular Membranes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Organelles"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosystem I Protein Complex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosystem II Protein Complex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1510928", "10.1021/bi00147a025"]}}]}
