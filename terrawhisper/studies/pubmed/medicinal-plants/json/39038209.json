However, the mechanisms that regulate demethylesterification remain largely unexplored. Pectin with a high degree of methylesterification is produced in the Golgi apparatus and then transferred to the primary cell wall where it is partially demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs). Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seed mucilage, pectin demethylesterification is negatively regulated by the transcription factor ZINC FINGER FAMILY PROTEIN5 (ZAT5). Plants carrying null mutations in ZAT5 had increased PME activity, decreased pectin methylesterification, and produced seeds with a thinner mucilage layer. We provide evidence that ZAT5 binds to a TGATCA-motif and thereby negatively regulates methylesterification by reducing the expression of PME5, HIGHLY METHYL ESTERIFIED SEEDS (HMS)/PME6, PME12, and PME16. We also demonstrate that ZAT5 physically interacts with BEL1-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN2 (BLH2) and BLH4 transcription factors. BLH2 and BLH4 are known to modulate pectin demethylesterification by directly regulating PME58 expression. The ZAT5-BLH2/4 interaction provides a mechanism to control the degree of pectin methylesterification in seed coat mucilage by modifying each transcription factor's ability to regulate the expression of target genes encoding PMEs. Taken together, these findings reveal a transcriptional regulatory module comprising ZAT5, BLH2 and BLH4, that functions in modulating the de-methylesterification of homogalacturonan in seed coat mucilage."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
