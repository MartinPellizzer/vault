Thus, preventive antioxidant activity of three plant powders of homogeneous particle sizes, 50-100 \u00b5m, 100-180 \u00b5m and 180-315 \u00b5m, dissolved directly in the cellular buffer, were compared to those of hydroethanolic (HE) extract, at 2 concentrations (250 and 500 \u00b5g/mL) in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated spleen cells. Overall, compared to HE extract, the superfine powders, i. e., fractions < 180 \u00b5m, at the lowest concentration, resulted in greater reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination, increased glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and lower malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Better antioxidant and preventive effects in pre-treated cells were found with the superfine powders for SA (i. e., 50-100 \u00b5m and 100-180 \u00b5m, both <i>p</i> < 0.001), and with the intermediate powder for RC (i. e., 100-180 \u00b5m, <i>p</i> < 0.05) <i>versus</i> HE extract. The activity levels of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in pretreated splenocytes exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, albeit reduced, were near to those in unexposed cells, suggesting that pretreatment with the fine powders has relatively restored the normal levels of antioxidant-related enzymes. These findings supported that CDSp improved the biological activities of plants, avoiding the use of organic solvents and thus it could be a good alternative to conventional extraction techniques."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, Neurotoxicologie Alimentaire et Bioactivit\u00e9, Metz, France."}], "LastName": "Soualeh", "ForeName": "Nidhal", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, Neurotoxicologie Alimentaire et Bioactivit\u00e9, Metz, France."}], "LastName": "Sti\u00e9venard", "ForeName": "Ali\u00e7ia", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 AGRITECH, Nancy, France."}], "LastName": "Baudelaire", "ForeName": "Elie", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, Neurotoxicologie Alimentaire et Bioactivit\u00e9, Metz, France."}], "LastName": "Soulimani", "ForeName": "Rachid", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, Neurotoxicologie Alimentaire et Bioactivit\u00e9, Metz, France."}], "LastName": "Bouayed", "ForeName": "Jaouad", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int J Vitam Nutr Res", "NlmUniqueID": "1273304", "ISSNLinking": "0300-9831"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30816796", "10.1024/0300-9831/a000506"]}}]}
