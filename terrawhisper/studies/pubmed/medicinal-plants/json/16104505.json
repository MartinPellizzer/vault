The effects of tanshinone II A on cell cycle of NCI-H460 were observed by FCM.

The outcome of FCM showed that the apoptotic cell rate was 1.2%, 3.4%, 7.7% respectively, when cultured with tanshinone II A at 0.5 microg/ml for 24, 48, 72 h. The apoptotic cell rate was 2.6%, 5.9%, 13.4%, when cultured with tanshinone II A at 1.0 microg/ml for 24, 48, 72 h.
