Apoptosis were detected through Hoechst 33258 staining. The effect of artonin B on the cell cycle of CCRF-CEM cells were studied by propidium iodide method. The change in mitochondrial membrane potential was detected by rohdamine 123 staining. The cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activity were checked by immunoassay kits, respectively. The expression of Bcl-2 family proteins was detected by Western blot.", "Our data revealed that artonin B strongly induced human CCRF-CEM leukemia cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner by MTT assay, but not on normal epithelia cells (HaCa cells). Artonin B-induced cell death was considered to be apoptotic by observing the typical apoptotic morphological change by Hoechst 33258 staining. The induction of human CCRF-CEM leukemia cancer cell death was caused by an induction of apoptosis through mitochondrial membrane potential change, cytochrome c release, sub-G1 proportion increase, downregulation of Bcl-2 expression, upregulation of Bax and Bak expression and activation of caspase 3 pathways.", "These results clearly demonstrated that artonin B is able to inhibit proliferation by induction of hypoploid cells and cell apoptosis. Moreover, the anticancer effects of artonin B were related to mitochondrial pathway and caspase 3 activation in human CCRF-CEM leukemia cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Education and Research, Shin-Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Chun-chung", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Chun-nan", "Initials": "CN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jow", "ForeName": "Guey-mei", "Initials": "GM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "BAX protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "artocarpanone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "artonin B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-43-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochromes c"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Artocarpus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochromes c"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16923337", "10.1111/j.1745-7254.2006.00404.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
