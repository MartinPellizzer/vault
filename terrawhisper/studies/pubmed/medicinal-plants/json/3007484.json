The modified calmodulins, oleic acid, and trypsin were assayed for their ability to activate pea plant NAD kinase, bovine brain 3',5'-cAMP phosphodiesterase, and human erythrocyte Ca2+-ATPase. All modified calmodulins activated both phosphodiesterase and Ca2+-ATPase; at the highest concentration assayed, calmodulin modified with 2 mol of reagent/mol activated phosphodiesterase and Ca2+-ATPase to 53% and 100%, respectively, of the activation obtained with unmodified calmodulin. However, higher concentrations of the modified calmodulins were required to observe the same activation; at least 900-fold and 100-fold higher concentrations were required for the two enzymes, respectively. NAD kinase was not activated by any calmodulin labeled to a stoichiometry greater than 1 mol/mol even when a concentration equal to 17,000 times the apparent dissociation constant of calmodulin for NAD kinase was assayed. Therefore, the modified protein (and not some fraction resistant to labeling) is active toward the mammalian enzymes but inactive toward plant NAD kinase. The different response of the three enzymes to the chemical modification suggests that the enzymes may utilize different binding domains on calmodulin. NAD kinase also was not activated by other known activators of the two mammalian enzymes, namely lipids and limited proteolysis. In parallel experiments using the same agents on each enzyme, NAD kinase was the only enzyme of the three that was not activated by oleic acid and several other lipids or by limited trypsin digestion. These results show that NAD kinase possesses several attributes which would not be predicted by current models of the mechanism of activation of enzymes by calmodulin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jarrett", "ForeName": "H W", "Initials": "HW"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM 31733", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Calmodulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenothiazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Succinimides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2UMI9U37CP", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "92911-21-2", "NameOfSubstance": "10-(3-propionyloxysuccinimide)-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenothiazine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphotransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.23", "NameOfSubstance": "NAD kinase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.4.17", "NameOfSubstance": "3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 7.2.2.10", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium-Transporting ATPases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium-Transporting ATPases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calmodulin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oleic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenothiazines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphotransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Succinimides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "4", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3007484", "S0021-9258(19)89200-1"]}}]}
