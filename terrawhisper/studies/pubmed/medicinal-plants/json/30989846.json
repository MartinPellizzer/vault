However,the lack of genomic information on medicinal taxa leads to problems in relation to resource conservation and the downstream application of traditional Chinese medicine resources,which restricts the modernization process of traditional Chinese medicine. Molecular phylogenetics is an important tool to understand the origin and evolution of the earth's biodiversity and promote the conservation and use of medicinal taxa. With the development of sequencing technology,the combination of genomic data extends the traditional molecular phylogenetics to the research level of phylogenomics,making it more powerfully applied to all aspects of biological research. Undoubtedly,carrying out phylogenomic research on Chinese medicine species will greatly promote their resources conservation,molecular evaluation and identification,and the exploration and utilization of natural pharmacodynamic components,promoting the modernization of traditional Chinese medicine. This article starts with a brief introduction of the developing history and basic research methods of phylogenomics,and then reviews the current research progress in phylogenomics related to traditional Chinese medicine resources. Finally,it discusses the problems existing in the current research and the next direction of phylogenomics research in medicinal taxa. The article will hopefully provide a reference for relevant researches in future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy,Hubei University of Chinese Medicine Wuhan 430065,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yi-Fei", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy,Hubei University of Chinese Medicine Wuhan 430065,China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Zhi-Gang", "Initials": "ZG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica,Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Science Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jiang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica,Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Science Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shi-Lin", "Initials": "SL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30989846", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20181226.021"]}}]}
