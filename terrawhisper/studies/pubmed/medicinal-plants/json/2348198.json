Their structures were established from physical and spectral data (mp, ir, [alpha]D, uv, cd, ms, 1H and 13C nmr). High field 1H- and 13C-nmr assignments were made for each compound using 1D and 2D nmr techniques including extensive 1H single-frequency spin-decoupling and nOe difference experiments, one-bond and long-range (COLOC) carbon-hydrogen correlations, and the INADEQUATE carbon-carbon correlation experiment. This is the first report of the presence of grayanotoxins IV and XIV in this source, of complete high field (500 MHz) 1H-nmr assignments for any grayanoid, and of 13C-nmr assignments for grayanotoxins IV and XIV. For grayanotoxin I, ambiguities in the literature 13C-nmr assignments have been removed by definitive assignments made through the use of the INADEQUATE experiment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210-1291."}], "LastName": "Burke", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Doskotch", "ForeName": "R W", "Initials": "RW"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "1 S10 RR01458-01A1", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toxins, Biological"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Toxins, Biological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2348198", "10.1021/np50067a017"]}}]}
