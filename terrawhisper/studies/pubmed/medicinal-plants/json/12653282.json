The study area was frequented by frost. Leaf yield of C. angustifolia under different treatments was estimated. It was found that the shrubs produced a significantly higher yield of leaves in the vicinity of the tree species as compared to the shrubs at a far distance from the trees. This was perhaps because of more protection of crops near the canopy of the plants during frosts. The yield was not much affected by the variation of tree species indicating that the effect of tree-shrub combination was not profound. C. angustifolia as inter-crop provides support to the farming system by way of conferring stability and generating assured income."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Arid Forest Research Institute, PO Krishi Mandi, New Pali Road, Jodhpur 342 005, India. dr_ranjana@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arya", "ForeName": "Ranjana", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Bioresour Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9889523", "ISSNLinking": "0960-8524"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Desert Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forestry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Senna Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12653282", "10.1016/s0960-8524(02)00150-5", "S0960-8524(02)00150-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
