This study aims to investigate a vitamin D supplementation effect on hematological indices of inflammation in rats.", "Forty-eight middle-aged male rats were allocated into a normal diet (ND) group (10% fat) and a high-fat diet (HFD) group (60% fat). The animals were fed for 26 weeks. After this period, each group was randomly divided into three subgroups, each of 8 rats: Group (1): animals were fed the ND and HFD containing 1 IU/g vitamin D for 4 months, group (2): animals were fed the ND and HFD containing 6 IU/g vitamin D for 4 months and group (3): animals were euthanized to evaluate the HFD effect. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, white blood cell count (WBCs), platelet count, platelet crit (PCT), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) were measured.", "The HFD, significantly increased body weight, PCT, PDW, PLR, NLR, and MLR and significantly reduced serum vitamin D levels compared to the ND (P < 0.05). There was a significant decrease in food intake, MPV, PDW, and NLR after vitamin D supplementation in the ND-fed group (P < 0.05). A significant reduction in platelet count, PCT, and MLR was observed after vitamin D supplementation in HFD-fed rats (P < 0.05).", "In our study, some hemogram-derived inflammatory indices were higher in the HFD-fed group, and vitamin D supplementation lowering effects on some hematological indices were seen in both ND and HFD groups."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2023 International Journal of Preventive Medicine."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutritions, School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Agh", "ForeName": "Fahimeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mousavi", "ForeName": "Seyed H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutritions, School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aryaeian", "ForeName": "Naheed", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutritions, School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amiri", "ForeName": "Fatemehsadat", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural products and medicinal plants research center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jalilvand", "ForeName": "Mohammad R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatsitics, School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Janani", "ForeName": "Leila", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition, School of Health, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Golestan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hasani", "ForeName": "Motahareh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sepahvand", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zamani-Garmsiri", "ForeName": "Fahimeh", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Int J Prev Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101535380", "ISSNLinking": "2008-7802"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Ageing and health: World Health Organization.
