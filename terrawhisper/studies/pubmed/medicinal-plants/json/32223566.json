Thereafter, patients were treated as outpatients with oral medication for additional 5 months. Four renal function tests (RFTs) were evaluated at various time points (TPs): (1) 6 months before baseline (TP -6), (2) at baseline (TP 0), and (3) after completion of 6 months of treatment (TP +6). Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Greenhouse-Geisser correction and Friedman's ANOVA by ranks were used to analyze the RFTs. For <i>post hoc</i> tests, the Bonferroni correction was applied. Bias-corrected effect sizes (Hedges) for the treatment were calculated. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Sixty-four nondialysis CRF patients with laboratory investigations of the preceding 6 months were included; 12 patients discontinued the treatment. Fifty-two patients with stage IV or V at baseline completed the study. Mean concentrations of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatinine, and hemoglobin differed significantly between TPs (eGFR: <i>F</i>\u2009=\u200915.3, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001; serum creatinine: <i>F</i>\u2009=\u200929.3, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001; blood urea: <i>F</i>\u2009=\u20092.0, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.159; hemoglobin: <i>F</i>\u2009=\u200953.9, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001). Pairwise comparisons of the mean differences between TPs are significant for eGFR, creatinine, and hemoglobin. For blood urea, a significant decrease was observed for the treatment period [15.9(\u2193) mg/dL, standard error 4.0; <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200952], but a nonsignificant increase was observed for the pretreatment period [16.2(\u2191) mg/dL, standard error 9.8] due to insufficient data for TP -6 (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200926). The effect sizes for eGFR, creatinine, blood urea, and hemoglobin were medium (0.45, 0.53, 0.44, and 0.30). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> After 6 months of treatment, statistically and clinically significant improvements of eGFR, creatinine, blood urea, and hemoglobin and a significant shift to better CRF stages were observed. Several cardinal symptoms were also significantly reduced. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to evaluate the effects in comparison to usual care."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Panchakarma, J.
