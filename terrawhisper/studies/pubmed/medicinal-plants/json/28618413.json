The aim of this study was to determine potential cytotoxic effects of aloe-emodin on HepaRG cells and to define the underlying mechanism.", "MTT was used to evaluate cell viability. Apoptotic cell death was analyzed via Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were determined by flow cytometry, while the expression of apoptosis-related proteins was determined by Western blot analysis.", "Treatment with aloe-emodin significantly reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in HepaRG cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. It provoked ROS generation and depolarization of MMP in HepaRG cells when compared with controls. Aloe-emodin dose-dependently increased release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, and levels of Fas, p53, p21, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, as well as activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, and subsequent cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). It also induced S-phase cell cycle arrest by increasing the expression of p21 and cyclin E proteins while significantly decreasing the expression of cyclin A and CDK2.", "These results suggest that aloe-emodin inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in HepaRG cells, most probably through a mechanism involving both Fas death pathway and the mitochondrial pathway by generation of ROS. These findings underscore the need for risk assessment of human exposure to aloe-emodin."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 The Author(s). Published by S.
