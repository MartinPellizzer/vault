In our previous study, we achieved the total synthesis of ailanthoidol (AT), a neolignan from Zanthoxylum ailanthoides or Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, which are used in Chinese traditional herbal medicine. In the present study, preliminarily, AT exhibited a radical quenching property by DPPH assay. Following this, we assessed the effect of AT on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in female CD-1 mouse skin which was closely linked to tumor promotion. The topical application of AT (0.5-2.5 mM; 200 microl) reduced the formation of hydrogen peroxide and inhibited the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the mouse skin when compared with that of the TPA-treated alone group. In addition, AT presented a suppression effect on the TPA-induced hyperplasia and leukocyte infiltration in the epidermis and edema of mouse ears. Furthermore, it showed that AT inhibited the TPA-induced expression of COX-2 protein and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in epidermis. Finally, AT was evaluated for its ability to inhibit the TPA-induced promotion in skin tumors of female CD-1 mice. Topical application of AT 5 min prior to TPA (5 nmol) three times weekly for 12 weeks to mice which were initiated with benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) inhibited the incidence of skin tumors in mice and the average number of tumors per mice as compared to TPA-treated alone. These results indicate that AT possesses potential as a chemopreventive agent against tumor promotion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, National Changhua University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan, ROC."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Yean-Jang", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kao", "ForeName": "Erl-Shyh", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Chia-Yih", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Wea-Lung", "Initials": "WL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiou", "ForeName": "Yea-Huey", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tseng", "ForeName": "Tsui-Hwa", "Initials": "TH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Oncol Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "9422756", "ISSNLinking": "1021-335X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzofurans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ailanthoidol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3417WMA06D", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NI40JAQ945", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzofurans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16969515"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
