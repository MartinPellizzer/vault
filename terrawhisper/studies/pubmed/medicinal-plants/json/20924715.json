Direct inoculation of nodal segments on semi-solid MS medium augmented with various concentrations of TDZ (0.1 to 0.9 \u03bcM) produced shoots but with low regeneration response and few shoots per explant. Hence, nodal explants were pretreated with greater concentrations of TDZ (5 to 100 \u03bcM) in liquid MS media for different durations (4, 8, 12, and 16 days) with the aim of improving shoot regeneration response from cultured explants. After pretreatment, explants were transferred to agar-solidified hormone-free MS medium. Best response in terms of percent regeneration (94%), number of shoots per explant (20.00 \u00b1 1.15), and greatest shoot length (7.23\u2009\u00b1\u20090.83 cm) were obtained with nodal segments pretreated in 75 \u03bcM TDZ for 8 days. Similarly, root induction was obtained from pulse-treated microshoots for 24 h with 200 \u03bcM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) followed by their transfer to 1/2 MS medium which produced an average of 5.50 \u00b1 0.92 roots per microshoot. The rooted plantlets were transplanted to soil with 80% success rate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Biotechnology Laboratory, Department of Botany, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh 202002, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jahan", "ForeName": "Anushi A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anis", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aref", "ForeName": "Ibrahim M", "Initials": "IM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Biochem Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8208561", "ISSNLinking": "0273-2289"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylurea Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiadiazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0091WH7STF", "NameOfSubstance": "thidiazuron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "061SKE27JP", "NameOfSubstance": "indolebutyric acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Oleaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylurea Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regeneration"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Thiadiazoles"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20924715", "10.1007/s12010-010-9089-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
