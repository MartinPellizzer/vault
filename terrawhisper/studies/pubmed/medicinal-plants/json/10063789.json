The circuit added mainly a venous reservoir collecting Injectio Radix Ginseng Compositae with cardiopulmonary bypass. Injectio Radix Ginseng Compositae was pumped into the ascending aorta of the animal after mixing with cardioplegia in the venous reservoir. The circuit was acceptable in terms of price by most inland medical laboratories. Perfusion as well as biochemical results monitored were satisfactory. Significant difference was noted between the average damage rates of the reperfused myocardial mitochondria in groups by ultrastructural analysis (70.12 +/- 2.56% vs. 25.33 +/- 17.62%, p = 0.023). No complications associated with perfusion technique occurred in either group. The circuit could offer a constant arterial perfusion, and was proved to be simple, safe and effective in cohort."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, 254 Hospital of Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Q", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China (Republic : 1949- )", "MedlineTA": "Kaohsiung J Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "100960562", "ISSNLinking": "1607-551X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10063789"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
