Thereafter, they were investigated in\u00a0vitro for antiviral activity and cytokine response upon H5N1 virus infection.", "The results revealed that both water and ethanol extracts of all the five studied plants showed significant antiviral activity against H5N1 virus. Among these plants, C.\u00a0longa and K.\u00a0parviflora showed strong anti-H5N1 activity. Thus, they were selected for further studies on their cytokine response upon virus infection. It was found that ethanol and water crude extracts of C.\u00a0longa and K.\u00a0parviflora induced significant upregulation of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expressions, suggesting their roles in the inhibition of H5N1 virus replication.", "To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is among the earliest reports to illustrate the antiviral property of these Asian medicinal plants against the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus. The results of this study shed light on alternative therapeutic sources for treatment of H5N1 influenza virus infection in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Hainan Medical University.
