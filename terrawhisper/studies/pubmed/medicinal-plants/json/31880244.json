PUD occurs due to an imbalance between offensive and defensive factors and Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI), Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and antibiotics are frequently used for the treatment. Recently, medicinal plants have emerged as efficacious, safe and widely available alternative therapies for PUD. The aim of this review was to study the medicinal plants and phytochemicals, which have been used for PUD treatment to evaluate the potential role of natural compounds to develop herbal remedies for PUD. Information was obtained using a literature search of electronic databases, such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed, Sci Finder, Reaxys and Cochrane. Common and scientific names of the plants and keywords such as 'peptic ulcer', 'gastric ulcer', 'stomach ulcer' and 'duodenal ulcer' were used for search. Eventually, 279 plants from 89 families were identified and information on the plant families, part of the plant used, chemical constituents, extracts, ulcer model used and dosage were abstracted. The results indicated that most of the anti-PUD plants were from Asteraceae (7.1%) and Fabaceae (6.8%) families while flavonoids (49%), tannins (13%), saponins (10%) and alkaloids (9%) were the most common natural compounds in plants with anti-PUD activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticulture, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department Agroecology, Aarhus University, 4200 Slagelse, Denmark."}], "LastName": "Ardalani", "ForeName": "Hamidreza", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticulture, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hadipanah", "ForeName": "Amin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Halal Research Center of IRI, FDA, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sahebkar", "ForeName": "Amirhossein", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mini Rev Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101094212", "ISSNLinking": "1389-5575"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Peptic Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31880244", "10.2174/1389557520666191227151939", "MRMC-EPUB-103295"]}}]}
