The number of oral cancer cases are increasing in the recent past. Advancements in cancer therapy are continuously evolving. In spite of that, the survival rate is very low along with adverse effects associated with each treatment modality. This poses a need for a constant search for newer or alternative treatment options. Herbal medicines or plant-based medicines are derived from plant sources. Evidence supports that incorporating herbal medicines in cancer therapy offers many advantages. Hence, exploring plant species for anticarcinogenic properties can potentially benefit cancer therapy. Studies show that the two medicinal herbs Plectranthus amboinicus (Indian borage, Karpooravalli) and Glycyrrhiza glabra (Liquorice, Athimathuram) have shown excellent anticancer activity on various cancers. The present study aimed to evaluate and assess the anticancer property of two medicinal plants Plectranthus amboinicus (Indian borage, Karpooravalli) and Glycyrrhiza glabra (Liquorice, Athimathuram) on oral cancer (KB) cell line.", "Ethanolic extracts of leaves of Plectranthus amboinicus and roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra were prepared. The oral cancer (KB) cell line was procured and cultured. Cell viability (MTT) assay was performed using various concentrations of both the plant extracts on oral cancer cells. The percentage of cell viability for each concentration was calculated and the IC50 value was derived for the two plant extracts.", "The results revealed a significant decrease in the percentage of viable cells with increasing concentration of the extracts. The IC50 values of Plectranthus amboinicus and Glycyrrhiza glabra were 53.0 \u00b5g/ml and 43.6 \u00b5g/ml respectively. On comparing the anticancer effect of the two extracts, Glycyrrhiza glabra was more cytotoxic than Plectranthus amboinicus on oral cancer (KB) cells.", "The two medicinal plants Plectranthus amboinicus and Glycyrrhiza glabra exhibited potent anticancer activity against oral cancer (KB) cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chettinad Dental College and Research Institute (CDCRI), Kelambakkam, Chennai, India."}], "LastName": "Caroline M", "ForeName": "Leo", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chettinad Dental College and Research Institute (CDCRI), Kelambakkam, Chennai, India."}], "LastName": "Muthukumar R", "ForeName": "Sathish", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chettinad Dental College and Research Institute (CDCRI), Kelambakkam, Chennai, India."}], "LastName": "A H", "ForeName": "Harini Priya", "Initials": "HP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chettinad Dental College and Research Institute (CDCRI), Kelambakkam, Chennai, India."}], "LastName": "N", "ForeName": "Nachiammai", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Thailand", "MedlineTA": "Asian Pac J Cancer Prev", "NlmUniqueID": "101130625", "ISSNLinking": "1513-7368"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plectranthus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Ankola AV, Kumar V, Thakur S, et al.
