Eggs per gram (EPG) counts were determined in the droppings of chickens prior and after treatment with powdered C. crista at doses of 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg of body weight along with its extracts in water and methanol in amounts representing 50 mg/kg of crude powder. The crude drug at the dose rates of 40 and 50 mg/kg and its methanol extract induced a significant (P < 0.001) effect on post-treatment days 10 and 15 while the 30 mg/kg dose was efficacious (P < 0.05) on day 15 only. However, the aqueous extract did not show significant results. These results suggest that a 50 mg/kg dose of C. crista seed powder, its equivalent methanolic extract and piperazine (200 mg/kg) are equieffective in treating the ascarid infection of poultry. The crude C. crista powder appears to be potent and safer than its methanol extract on the basis of the side effects observed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Javed", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Akhtar", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "Z U", "Initials": "ZU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khaliq", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Hungary", "MedlineTA": "Acta Vet Hung", "NlmUniqueID": "8406376", "ISSNLinking": "0236-6290"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthelmintics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Piperazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V7P5P122LB", "NameOfSubstance": "piperazine adipate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anthelmintics"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Ascaridia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Ascaridiasis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Piperazines"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Poultry Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7810393"]}}]}
