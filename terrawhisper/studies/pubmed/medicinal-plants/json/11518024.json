We have investigated Diamed for its possible antihyperglycaemic action in rats with alloxan-induced experimental diabetes. Oral administration of Diamed (1.39 (0.25 g), 1.67 (0.30 g) or 1.94 (0.35 g) mL kg(-1)) for 30 days resulted in a significant reduction in blood glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin, and an increase in plasma insulin and total haemoglobin. The effect was highly significant after administration of the 1.94 mL (0.35 g) g(-1) body weight dose. Diamed also prevented a decrease in body weight. An oral glucose tolerance test was performed in experimental diabetic rats in which there was a significant improvement in glucose tolerance in the animals treated with Diamed. The effect was compared with 600 microg kg(-1) glibenclamide. The results showed that Diamed had antihyperglycaemic action in experimental diabetes in rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Annamalai University, Tamil Nadu, India. paribala@sancharnet.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pari", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ramakrishnan", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Venkateswaran", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11518024", "10.1211/0022357011776397"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
