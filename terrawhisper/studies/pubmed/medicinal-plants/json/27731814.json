The purpose of the study is to evaluate the ameliorative potential of the ethanolic leaf extract and fractions of Solanum trilobatum (St) against alloxan induced diabetic rats. Solanum trilobatum leaf extract and fractions were administered orally at two different concentration (100-200mg/kg body weight) to alloxan induced diabetic rats. The antidiabetic efficacy was validated through various biochemical parameters, enzyme assays, renal markers and antioxidant properties were also determined. The phytochemical analyses of St leaves were done by estimating their Chlorophyll, carotenoids, total sugar, protein, amino acid and minerals contents. The results revealed that the leaf extracts and fractions of St were efficient anti hyperglycemic agents and posses potent nephro-protective activity. However, the extracts of St leaves at a concentration of 200mg/kg bw exhibit higher efficacy in all tested concentrations. From the result it can be concluded that the leaf extracts of St can be a potential candidate in treating the hyperglycemic conditions and justifies its use in ethano medicine and can be exploits in the management of diabetes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, K.S.
