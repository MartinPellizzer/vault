Following three months of continuous hormonal treatment, the weight of prostates in estradiol/testosterone-treated castrated rats was significantly increased in comparison with sham-operated rats. Such an increase started rapidly, reached a maximum by 30 days and remained at a plateau or slightly declined thereafter. The increase of prostate total weight induced by the hormone treatment was inhibited by administration of LSESR. Indeed, the weight was significantly lower at day 60 and day 90 for the dorsal and lateral regions of the prostate. The weight of the ventral region of the prostate was significantly lower after 30 and 60 days treatment with LSESR. These results demonstrate that administering LSESR to hormone-treated castrated rats inhibits the increase in prostate wet weight. This effect of LSESR may explain the beneficial effect of this extract in human benign prostatic hypertrophy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BIO-Inova EuroLab Research Labs, Plaisir, France."}], "LastName": "Paubert-Braquet", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Richardson", "ForeName": "F O", "Initials": "FO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Servent-Saez", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gordon", "ForeName": "W C", "Initials": "WC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Monge", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bazan", "ForeName": "N G", "Initials": "NG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Authie", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Braquet", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8907422", "ISSNLinking": "1043-6618"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Androgen Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3XMK78S47O", "NameOfSubstance": "Testosterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4TI98Z838E", "NameOfSubstance": "Estradiol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J7WWH9M8QS", "NameOfSubstance": "saw palmetto extract"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Androgen Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Estradiol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Orchiectomy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Prostatic Hyperplasia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Serenoa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Testosterone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9051712", "10.1006/phrs.1996.0085", "S1043661896900857"]}}]}
