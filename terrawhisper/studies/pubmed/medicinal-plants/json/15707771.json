In the present study, the effects of aqueous extract of Danggui-Shaoyao-san on naturally aged mice were examined to investigate the pharmacological basis for its therapeutic efficacy on senile dementia. The results showed that DSS significantly prolonged latency in a step-through test and increased brain index so as to improve impaired cognitive function of aged mice after oral administration at doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg for 3 months. Using high-performance liquid chromatography technique with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD), it was found that DSS increased the content of monoamine neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in brains of aged mice. Using transmission electron microscope, it was found that DSS dose-dependently protected the ultrastructure of brain cortex in aged mice. These results indicate that DSS ameliorates memory dysfunction, modulates metabolism of monoamine neurotransmitters and protects the ultrastructure of cortex changed by aging. These findings suggest that DSS may be a useful therapeutic agent for senile dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chinese Compound Prescription, China Pharmaceutical University, Box C-09, 1 Shennong Road, Nanjing 210038, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kou", "ForeName": "Junping", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Danni", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Yongqing", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neurotransmitter Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Memory Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neurotransmitter Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15707771", "10.1016/j.jep.2004.11.020", "S0378-8741(04)00582-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
