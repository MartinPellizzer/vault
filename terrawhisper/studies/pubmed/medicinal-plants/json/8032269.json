B-RNA is able to replicate independently from M-RNA in cowpea protoplasts. Replication of mutant B-transcripts could not be supported by co-inoculated wild-type B-RNA, indicating that B-RNA cannot be efficiently replicated in trans. Hence replication of a B-RNA molecule is tightly linked to its translation and/or at least one of the replicative proteins functions in cis only. Remarkably also for efficient replication of M-RNA one of its translation products was found to be required in cis. This 58K protein possibly helps in directing the B-RNA-encoded replication complex to the M-RNA. In order to identify the viral polymerase the CPMV B-RNA-specific proteins have been produced individually in cowpea protoplasts using CaMV 35S promoter based expression vectors. Only protoplasts transfected with a vector containing the 200K coding sequence were able to support replication of co-transfected M-RNA. Despite this, CPMV-specific RNA polymerase activity could not be detected in extracts of these protoplasts using a poly(A)/oligo(U) assay. These results indicate that, in contrast to the poliovirus polymerase, the CPMV polymerase is not able to accept oligo(U) as a primer and in addition support the concept that translation and replication are linked."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology, Agricultural University, Wageningen, The Netherlands."}], "LastName": "Wellink", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "van Bokhoven", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Le Gall", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Verver", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "van Kammen", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Arch Virol Suppl", "NlmUniqueID": "9214275", "ISSNLinking": "0939-1983"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.7.6", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Comovirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Mutational Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Insecta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Biosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Protoplasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virus Replication"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8032269", "10.1007/978-3-7091-9326-6_38"]}}]}
