Although several neuroprotective drugs have been designed for the treatment of MS, complete remission is yet matter of debate. Therefore, development of novel therapeutic approaches for MS is of a high priority in immunological research. Nanomedicine is a recently developed novel medical field, which is applicable in both diagnosis and treatment of several cancers and autoimmune diseases. Although there is a marked progress in neuroimaging through using nanoparticles, little is known regarding the therapeutic potential of nanomedicine in neurological disorders, particularly MS. Moreover, the majority of data is limited to the MS related animal models. In this review, we will discuss about the brain targeting potential of different nanoparticles as well as the role of nanomedicine in the diagnosis and treatment of MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences , Yasuj , Iran ;"}], "LastName": "Ghalamfarsa", "ForeName": "Ghasem", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Oncology-Pathology, Immune and Gene Therapy Lab , Cancer Center Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institute , Stockholm , Sweden ;"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Immunology, School of Medicine , Bushehr University of Medical Sciences , Bushehr , Iran ;"}], "LastName": "Hojjat-Farsangi", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Cellular and Molecular Biology Research Center, Health Research Institute, Babol University of Medical Sciences , Babol , Iran ;"}], "LastName": "Mohammadnia-Afrouzi", "ForeName": "Mousa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine , Ilam University of Medical Sciences , Ilam , Iran ;"}], "LastName": "Anvari", "ForeName": "Enayat", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f Department of Agricultural Engineering , Islamic Azad University , Tehran ;"}], "LastName": "Farhadi", "ForeName": "Shohreh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "g Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran ;"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "h Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine , Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran ;"}], "LastName": "Yousefi", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "g Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran ;"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "h Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine , Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran ;"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "i Department of Immunology, School of Public Health , Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Jadidi-Niaragh", "ForeName": "Farhad", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Immunotoxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "101201960", "ISSNLinking": "1547-691X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood-Brain Barrier"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diagnostic Imaging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Multiple Sclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neurogenic Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Theranostic Nanomedicine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27416019", "10.3109/1547691X.2016.1159264"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
