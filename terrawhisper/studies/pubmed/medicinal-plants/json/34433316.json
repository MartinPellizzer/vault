However, typical anthracnose lesions on the leaves are usually observed in summer in Zhejiang province. A number of 100 trees have been investigated with over 70% of leaf disease incidence. The symptom initially develops from the tip or edge of the leaf and dark green infected spots appear. The diseased spots expand and become yellow brown. The lesions are covered with abundant, small and black acervuli at the center with yellow edges. The diseased leaves become brittle, cracked, and finally fall off. Sixty leaves with typical anthracnose symptoms were sampled from gardens in Lin'an, Zhejiang province. The diseased tissues were cut into pieces and incubated in moist chambers at 25\u00b0C. The spore mass was collected using a sterile needle under dissection microscope and put on 2% malt extract agar (MEA). The cultures were incubated at 25\u00b0C in the dark for one week. Thirty single spore cultures were obtained and grown on 2% MEA at 25\u00b0C for morphological characterization. White aerial mycelia and black conidiomata with orange masses of conidia developed seven days later. Conidia are cylindrical in shape, 12-19 \u03bcm, mean lengths ranging from 15.5 \u00b1 1.0 to 16.0 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcm. The morphological characteristics are consistent with those of Colletotrichum species. DNA was extracted from three selected isolates (HT-71, J-5, J-20) for sequencing. The partial regions of ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS), calmodulin (CAL), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), actin gene (ACT), beta-tubulin (TUB2), Apn2-Mat1-2 intergenic spacer and partial mating type gene (ApMat), and glutamine synthetase (GS) were amplified as described by Liu et al. (2015). Sequences of the above seven loci for the selected isolates were obtained, and deposited in the GenBank database (MZ014901 to MZ014905, MZ514915 to MZ514922, MZ514925 to MZ514930, MZ497332 and MZ497333). BLAST results indicate they represent Colletotricum siamense. Multi-locus phylogenetic analysis including ex-type of C. siamense (ICMP18578=CBS130417) and related species was conducted using Maximum Likelihood method, and C. acutatum (CBS 112996) served as the outgroup. The three obtained isolates clustered with the ex-type isolate of C. siamense. Eight leaves on two Camellia plants were inoculated to confirm the pathogenicity in the field. The leaves were surface sprayed with 75% ethanol and dried with sterilized filter paper. The leaves were inoculated using the wound/drop inoculation method: an aliquot of 10 \u03bcL of spore suspension (1.0 \u00d7 106 conidia per mL) was dropped on the left side of a leaf after wounding once by pin-pricking with a sterilized needle. The sterile water was dropped on the right side of the same leaf in parallel as control. The initial symptoms were observed seven days later, all inoculated leaves developed lesions similar to those observed in the field, and no symptoms observed in the control. The fungus was successfully re-isolated only from lesions inoculated with spore suspension exhibiting morphological characteristics resembling those in C. siamense, and further confirmed with sequence data. To our knowledge, this represents the first report of anthracnose on C. japonica caused by C. siamense worldwide. Confirmation of this pathogen in the region will be helpful for the disease management on C. japonica, considering previous report of C. camelliae-japonicae on the same host.
