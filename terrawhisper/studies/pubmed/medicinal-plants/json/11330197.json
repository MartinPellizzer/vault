Among these cell lines the best one TZ-1 which growth index was 4.12 and the flavonol glycoside content was 1.25% in dried cell which was enhanced 257.1% compared with callus. The stability in subcultures was investigated: The average content of flavonol glycoside was 1.25% in dried cells and the growth index was 3.99 during 6 subcultures. Which variation coefficient was separately 0.065 and 0.048. The results show that hypoxia stress is a efficient method to select suspension cell line of higher productivity of flavonol glycoside."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Central-south University of Technology, Changsha 410082, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "S P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9426463", "ISSNLinking": "1000-3061"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Suspensions"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Hypoxia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavonols"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Suspensions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11330197"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
