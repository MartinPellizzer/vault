Although the rationality of efficacy as natural antioxidants with different bioactive compounds in <i>Coccinia grandis</i> against monosodium glutamate (MSG) induced hepato-cardiac damage remains to be disclosed. Six different solvent extracts of the leaves of <i>Coccinia grandis</i> were chosen to evaluate <i>in vitro</i> antioxidant and free radical (FR)-scavenging activity. Due to high antioxidant content and FR-scavenging property of ethanol extract of <i>Coccinia grandis</i> leaves (EECGL) and presence of different bioactive compounds in EECGL was further tested to evaluate <i>in vivo</i> hepato-protective and cardio-protective efficacy against MSG-induced anomalies. MSG-induced dyslipidemia, increased cell toxicity markers altered functional status and histopathological peculiarities of target organs were blunted by EECGL. Additionally, MSG incited increase level of interleukin (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 which activates nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) guided inflammation via down regulation of IL-10; impaired redox-homeostasis subsequently promoted inflammation associated oxidative stress (OS) and increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which provoked microvascular proliferation related cellular damage. On the contrary, increased lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide promotes reduced cell viability, deoxyribonucleic acid damage and apoptosis via activation of caspase 3. EECGL significantly reduced MSG-induced inflammation mediated OS and apoptosis via inhibition of pro-inflammatory factors and pro-apoptotic mediators to protect liver and heart. Therefore, it can be suggested that EECGL contributed competent scientific information to validate the demands for its use to treat MSG-induced hepato-cardiac OS mediated inflammation and apoptosis from natural origin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8727-0227"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology (UG & PG), 212035Serampore College, Hooghly, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Banerjee", "ForeName": "Arnab", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4176-3496"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology (UG & PG), 212035Serampore College, Hooghly, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Mukherjee", "ForeName": "Sandip", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7017-1399"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology (UG & PG), 212035Serampore College, Hooghly, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Maji", "ForeName": "Bithin Kumar", "Initials": "BK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hum Exp Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "9004560", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "W81N5U6R6U", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Glutamate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cucurbitaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Glutamate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "25"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33887972", "10.1177/09603271211010895"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
