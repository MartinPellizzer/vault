Eight MCL-transected/herb-treated rats (group 1) were compared with 8 MCL-transected/placebo-treated controls (group 2) and 8 MCL-intact/placebo-treated rats (group 3). At 3 and 6 weeks posttransection, MCL specimens were examined under electron microscope. With analysis of 370,709 collagen fibrils, all herb-treated animals had significantly larger fibrils than the controls (p < .001) at 6 weeks postinjury. The mean diameter of those peripheral collagen fibrils of group 1 was larger than the sham group (p < .001). The mass-averaged diameters of group 1 (50.49 to 143.07 nm) and group 3 (59.69 to 188.88 nm) were larger than group 2 (50.59 to 121.94 nm). The area coverage by collagen fibrils ranged from 46.86 to 94.97% for group 1 and 43.70 to 68.08%f or group 3 as compared with 40.01 to 50.77% for group 2. Mode obliquity was 0.56 to 0.84 among groups. We concluded that herbal remedy increases collagen fibril size of healing rat MCLs homogeneously at 6 weeks posttransection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fung", "ForeName": "D T C", "Initials": "DT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ng", "ForeName": "G Y F", "Initials": "GY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Connect Tissue Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0365263", "ISSNLinking": "0300-8207"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intralesional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "injuries", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Medial Collateral Ligament, Knee"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15763927", "10.1080/03008200490442662", "CTK78DDBA9WA2NXG"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
