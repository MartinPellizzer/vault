Amongst various metals, Lead (Pb) contamination has become alarming for plant and human heath through ingesting of polluted soils and food crops. To counterfeit this, a nanotechnological neutralizer effective in form of soiling of cobalt oxide Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> Nbs to Acacia jacquemontii and Acacia nilotica with various meditations as 25, 50, 75 and 100\u00a0ppm). A Substantial result was observed on growth of plants but premium results were got by applications of cobalt oxide Nbs at 75\u00a0ppm. By this means, enhanced root length (39%), fresh weight (32%), shoot length (58%), as well as dry weight (28%) in selected Acacia species compared to control. Chlrophy contents in A. jacquemontii were estimated to be 0.23, 2.73 and 3.19\u00a0mg/L with treated with different concentrations of cobalt Nbs while in A. nilotica, the contents were 0.51, 2.93 and 3.12\u00a0mg/L respectively on same concentration. The atomic absorption (AAS), antioxidant activity and defendable positive comeback by using Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> Nbs. Hence, the greenly synthesized Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> Nbs counter acts lead toxicity to override and preserving the growth of plant. Such nanotechnological kits can consequently enhance the alternative system to stunned toxicity for distinguish the yield demand end to end with the progress of agronomic management approaches."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
