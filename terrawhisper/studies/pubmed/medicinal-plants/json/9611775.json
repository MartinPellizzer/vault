Ginsenoside Rh3 and Rh4 were recently isolated from Panax ginseng, but their biochemical and pharmacological effects remain unidentified. The present study investigated whether the ginsenoside Rh group (G-Rh1, -Rh2, -Rh3 and -Rh4) having similar structures induce differentiation of HL-60 cells and whether protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in differentiation by ginsenoside. Differentiation was assessed by Wright-Giemsa stain and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction. G-Rh2 and G-Rh3 induced differentiation of HL-60 cells into morphologically and functionally granulocytes but G-Rh1 and G-Rh4 did not. G-Rh2 and G-Rh3 arrested the cell cycle at the G1/S phase, consistent with the ability to induce differentiation in a decreasing order of retinoic acid > G-Rh2 > G-Rh3. During differentiation by G-Rh2, Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent PKC activity was increased in both the cytosol and total cell extract and Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent phosphorylation of 38 and 200 kDa endogenous proteins increased, while phosphorylation of 60, 64, 66 and 97 kDa proteins was Ca2+/phospholipid-independent. When cytosolic PKC isoforms were analyzed by immunoblotting, no significant change was observed in the alpha level, however, the immunoreactive 60 kDa band of a similar mass to the PKC catalytic fragment appeared following treatment with G-Rh2. The beta isoform was gradually increased with prolonged treatment. The gamma isoform was not detected in the cytosol of untreated cells, whereas a small amount was detected 5 days after treatment. It is concluded that G-Rh2 and G-Rh3 can induce differentiation of HL-60 cells into granulocytes and modulation of PKC isoform levels may contribute to differentiation of HL-60 cells by G-Rh2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Korea Ginseng and Tobacco Research Institute, Yousong-Gu, Taejon, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "D S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S I", "Initials": "SI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Int J Biochem Cell Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9508482", "ISSNLinking": "1357-2725"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "105558-26-7", "NameOfSubstance": "ginsenoside Rh3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5688UTC01R", "NameOfSubstance": "Tretinoin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "78214-33-2", "NameOfSubstance": "ginsenoside Rh2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Kinase C"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Granulocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HL-60 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Kinase C"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tretinoin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9611775", "10.1016/s1357-2725(97)00141-6", "S1357-2725(97)00141-6"]}}]}
