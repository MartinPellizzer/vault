The purpose of present study was to evaluate synergy potential and understanding the drug resistance reversal mechanism of chanoclavine isolated from Ipomoea muricata against the multi-drug-resistant clinical isolate of Escherichia coli (MDREC). Although chanoclavine did not show antibacterial activity of its own, but in combination, it could reduce the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tetracycline (TET) up to 16-folds. Chanoclavine was found to inhibit the efflux pumps which seem to be ATPase-dependent. In real-time expression analysis, chanoclavine showed down-regulation of different efflux pump genes and decreased the mutation prevention concentration of tetracycline. Further, in silico docking studies revealed significant binding affinity of chanoclavine with different proteins known to be involved in drug resistance. In in silico ADME/toxicity studies, chanoclavine was found safe with good intestinal absorption, aqueous solubility, medium blood-brain barrier (BBB), no CYP 2D6 inhibition, no hepatotoxicity, no skin irritancy, and non-mutagenic indicating towards drug likeliness of this molecule. Based on these observations, it is hypothesized that chanoclavine might be inhibiting the efflux of tetracycline from MDREC and thus enabling the more availability of tetracycline inside the cell for its action."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4704-7116"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Molecular Bioprospection Department , CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants , Lucknow 226015 , India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Microbiology Department , ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre , Bhubaneshwar 751023 , Odisha , India."}], "LastName": "Dwivedi", "ForeName": "Gaurav Raj", "Initials": "GR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Medicinal Chemistry Department , CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants , Lucknow 226015 , India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Pharmacopoeia Commission for Indian Medicine and Homeopathy (PCIM&H) , PLIM Campus, Ghaziabad 201002 , India."}], "LastName": "Maurya", "ForeName": "Anupam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Metabolic & Structural Biology , CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants , Lucknow 226015 , India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f College of Pharmacy , Gachon University , Hambakmoeiro 191, Yeonsu-gu, Incheon City 406-799 , Korea."}], "LastName": "Yadav", "ForeName": "Dharmendra Kumar", "Initials": "DK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Molecular Bioprospection Department , CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants , Lucknow 226015 , India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Vigyasa", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Metabolic & Structural Biology , CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants , Lucknow 226015 , India."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Feroz", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "g Department of Microbiology , King George Medical University , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Mahendra Kumar", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "g Department of Microbiology , King George Medical University , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Mastan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4397-5516"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Molecular Bioprospection Department , CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants , Lucknow 226015 , India."}], "LastName": "Darokar", "ForeName": "Mahendra P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Medicinal Chemistry Department , CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants , Lucknow 226015 , India."}], "LastName": "Srivastava", "ForeName": "Santosh Kumar", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biomol Struct Dyn", "NlmUniqueID": "8404176", "ISSNLinking": "0739-1102"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ergolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "32X6F73RE2", "NameOfSubstance": "chanoclavine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphatases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "F8VB5M810T", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetracycline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphatases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ergolines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tetracycline"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29595093", "10.1080/07391102.2018.1458654"]}}]}
