This work was undertaken to evaluate its antiurolithic potential and explore the possible underlying mechanism(s). Berberine was tested in vitro for the antioxidant effect and in vivo for diuretic and antiurolithic effects on an animal model of calcium oxalate urolithiasis. Berberine exhibited concentration-dependent (50-150\u03bcg/ml) antioxidant effect against ferrous-ascorbate induced lipid peroxidation in rat kidney homogenate with potency slightly higher than the reference antioxidant, butylated hydroxytoluene. In Wistar rats, berberine (5-20mg/kg) increased urine output accompanied by increased pH and Na(+) and K(+) excretion and decreased Ca(2+) excretion, similar to hydrochlorothiazide. In an animal model of calcium oxalate urolithiasis developed in male Wistar rats by adding 0.75% ethylene glycol in drinking water, berberine (10mg/kg) prevented as well as eliminated calcium oxalate crystal deposition in renal tubules and protected against deleterious effects of lithogenic treatment including weight loss, impaired renal function and oxidative stress, manifested as increased malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents, depleted GSH and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities of the kidneys. In na\u00efve rats, berberine (10mg/kg) increased urine volume and pH and decreased Ca(2+) excretion. Results of this study suggest the presence of antiurolithic effects in berberine against calcium oxalate stones mediated through a combination of antioxidant, diuretic, urinary alkalinizing and hypocalciuric effects. These data invite future studies on berberine to establish its efficacy for clinical use."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.
