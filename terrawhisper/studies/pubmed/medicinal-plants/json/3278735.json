The glycaemic response of healthy males to potato, bread, rice and green gram (Phaseolus aureus Roxb.) was compared with that to meals equivalent to these foods in terms of carbohydrate, protein, fat and fibre content, but made up of maize flour, casein, maize oil and ispaghula husk. 2. Natural foods led to a higher postprandial glycaemia than their respective equivalents, but the difference was significant only in the case of potato at 0.5 h (P less than 0.05). 3. The insulin response, studied only in the case of rice and green gram, followed a trend similar to the glycaemic response but the differences between natural foods and equivalents were even more marked. 4. A food is more than the sum of its major nutrients. Several poorly understood factors may contribute to the glycaemic response to a food. In addition to the quantity of nutrients, the response may be the result of the specific type of nutrients, non-nutrient chemicals and anti-nutrients composing the food, and their unique physical arrangement within the food."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi."}], "LastName": "Sud", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Siddhu", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bijlani", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Karmarkar", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0372547", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bread"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solanum tuberosum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3278735", "10.1079/bjn19880004", "S0007114588000054"]}}]}
