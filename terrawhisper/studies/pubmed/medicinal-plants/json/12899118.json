As a result, the required effect diminished very quickly. Prescriptions for Kavasporal forte showed that the daily dosage of 2 capsules per day complied with the recommendations in only 49.1% of the cases; in 38.8% of the cases, the dosage dropped below the respective recommendation. As a consequence, the lower-dosed Kavasporal forte was prescribed for longer periods than the higher-dosed Antares and Laitan.", "In the case of a low-dosage recommendation, we saw a trend to over-dose in prescribing behaviour, which increases the risk of undesirable adverse reactions. On the other hand, we saw a trend to under-dose in the case of a higher dosage recommendation. This fact may explain the unexpected inefficacy of the therapy. These trends affected the duration of therapy, whereby a dosage lower than the RDD was prescribed for a longer period than a dosage higher than the RDD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IMS HEALTH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. gdietlein@de.imshealth.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dietlein", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schr\u00f6der-Bernhardi", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf", "NlmUniqueID": "9208369", "ISSNLinking": "1053-8569"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depression"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Overdose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kava"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Practice Patterns, Physicians'"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12899118", "10.1002/pds.839"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
