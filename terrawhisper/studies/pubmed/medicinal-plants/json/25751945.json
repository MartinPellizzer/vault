With acteoside as the reference, HPLC was adopted for fingerprint analysis on Congrong Zonggan capsule. The chromatographic conditions wereas follows. Waters C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 \u03bcm) was used, with methylalcohol-0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase for gradient elution at the flow rate of 1.0 mL x min(-1). The detection wavelength was 330 nm, and the column temperature was 30 \u00b0C. This method was highly accurate and reproducible. All of the 13 components in tested samples reached the baseline resolved peak, and 15 batches of finished products showed the similarity of above 0.95. The method was accurate and feasible and could be used as a simple and effective method to evaluate the quality of the traditional Chinese medicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Su-De", "Initials": "SD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jia-Chun", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsules"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Capsules"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25751945"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
