However, complexities present in HM due to the unclear bioactive compounds, mechanisms of action, undetermined targets for therapy, and nonspecific features for metabolism, are currently an obstacle for the progression of novel drug discovery. Metabolomics could be a potential tool to overcome these issues and for the understanding of HM from a small-molecule metabolism level. The chinmedomics-based metabolomics method assesses the overall metabolism of organisms with a holistic view and shows great potential for understanding metabolic pathways, evaluating curative effects, clarifying mechanisms, discovering active ingredients, and precision medicine. This review focuses on the efficacy evaluation, active ingredient discovery, and target exploration of HM based on metabolomics and chinmedomics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
