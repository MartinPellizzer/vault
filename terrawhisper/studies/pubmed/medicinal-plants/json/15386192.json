(ribwort plantain) was effectively propagated by direct organogenesis from segments of leaves and roots using MS medium supplemented with IAA (11.42 microM), kinetin (9.29 microM) for multiplication and IAA (5.71 microM) for rooting. The plantlets were successfully hardened (80 %) and transferred to field cultivation (100 %). Two lines of callus tissue, derived from leaves and roots, were obtained on MS medium without NH (4)NO (3) and supplemented with 2,4-D (4.52 microM) and kinetin ( 0.46 microM). From plant materials--leaf rosettes from in vitro, leaves from plants in field cultivation obtained by micropropagation, root-derived callus and leaf-derived callus--sixteen phenylethanoid glucosides representing nine different structures were isolated and identified by spectral methods (1D and 2D NMR) as known for the species: lavandulifolioside ( 1), plantamajoside ( 2,) acteoside ( 3); new for the species: leucosceptoside A ( 4), martynoside ( 5), desrhamnosylisoacteoside ( 6), plantainoside D ( 7), desrhamnosylacteoside ( 8) and - 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl beta- D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->3)-4- O- trans- and cis- p-coumaroyl-beta- D-glucopyranoside ( 9)--the latter also being found for the first time in nature and named lancetoside. Only plantamajoside ( 2) and acteoside ( 3) were common to all plant materials, the former was the main constituent of calli (1.19 - 2.84 % of dry weight), while the latter was the main constituent of the leaves (1.78 - 10.43 % of dry weight). Flavonoids were present only in plants of field cultivation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, K.
