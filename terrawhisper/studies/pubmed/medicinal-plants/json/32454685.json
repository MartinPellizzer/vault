Determination of OTA was performed using HPLC-FLD after immunoaffinity column clean-up.", "OTA was detected in only one chamomile sample with a low concentration level of 0.034 \u00b5g/kg. According to the results of ICP-OES analysis, Pb in the concentration range of 4.125-6.487 mg/kg, 3.123-5.769 mg/kg and 3.229-5.985 mg/kg and Cd in the concentration range of 0.324-0.524 mg/kg, 0.365-0.51 mg/kg and 0.321-0.474 mg/kg was found in linden, chamomile, and sage teas, respectively.", "We indicated that levels of Pb and OTA were found below the maximum permissible level whereas high levels of Cd were observed in medicinal plants, which may not pose a health risk for consumers according to the exposure assessment.
