A vital part of the healthcare system is herbal medicines, consisting of therapeutic agents with high safety profile and no or least adverse effects. Herbs or medicinal plants show anticancer, antioxidant, and gene-protective activity, which is useful for pharmaceutical industries. In vitro, the extract of antioxidant compounds prevents the growth of colon and liver cancer cells, followed by a dose-dependent method. The screening of extracts is done by using in vitro models. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals lead to diseases based on age which promotes oxidative stress. Different types of ROSs available have central roles in the normal physiology and functioning of processes. Herbal or traditional plant medicines have rich antioxidant activity. Despite the limited literature on the health effect of herbal extract or spices. There are many studies examining the encouraging health effects of single phytochemicals instigating from the medicinal plant. This review provides a detailed overview on herbal antioxidants and how application of nanotechnology can improve its biological activity in managing several major diseases, and having no reported side effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
