Melanin synthesis is influenced by a variety of extrinsic and internal variables, including hormone fluctuations, inflammation, ageing, and subsequent ultraviolet light exposure. Melasma, senile lentigines, freckles, and diminished colour are all undesirable side effects of excessive melanin production. The current review provides the pursuit of effective and safe tyrosinase inhibitors derived from medicinal plants and ascribes updated inferences on current practices. Commercially available tyrosinase inhibitors provide an even skin tone and are used clinically to treat hyperpigmentation and related disorders. This review focuses on the mechanism of melanogenesis and on experimentally verified potent and natural tyrosinase inhibitors. Bioactive compounds such as phenols, flavonoids, stilbenes, and few traditional herbal formulations from the Indian system of medicine, have been used for long in India and subcontinents for the effective management of melanogenesis and related problems. Scientific information was gathered from different sources of databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Springer, Scopus, and Science Direct, as well as the literature found in medicinal plant books. This critically summarized review ensures to aid researchers and enterprises working on tyrosinase inhibitors and on conditions associated with melanogenesis, to get one-step solutions for identifying more safe and effective natural remedies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Excellence in Unani Medicine, Bioactive Natural Product Laboratory, Department of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, 110062, India."}], "LastName": "Insaf", "ForeName": "Areeba", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmaceutical Education & Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, 110062, India."}], "LastName": "Parveen", "ForeName": "Rabea", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Excellence in Unani Medicine, Bioactive Natural Product Laboratory, Department of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, 110062, India."}], "LastName": "Gautam", "ForeName": "Gaurav", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Excellence in Unani Medicine, Bioactive Natural Product Laboratory, Department of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, 110062, India."}], "LastName": "Samal", "ForeName": "Monalisha", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Excellence in Unani Medicine, Bioactive Natural Product Laboratory, Department of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, 110062, India."}], "LastName": "Zahiruddin", "ForeName": "Sultan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Excellence in Unani Medicine, Bioactive Natural Product Laboratory, Department of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, 110062, India."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Sayeed", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Melanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.18.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Monophenol Monooxygenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperpigmentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Melanins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monophenol Monooxygenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36017830", "10.2174/1389201023666220823144242", "CPB-EPUB-125809"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
