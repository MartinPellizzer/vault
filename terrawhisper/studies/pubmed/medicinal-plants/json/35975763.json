The chemical structure of <b>1</b> was elucidated by comprehensive spectral analyses. The known compounds <b>2</b>-<b>6</b> were identified by comparing their spectral data with those reported in the literature, which were isolated from <i>M. citrifolia</i> for the first time. In addition, the anti-inflammatory and anti-HIV activities of compounds <b>1</b>-<b>6</b> were evaluated <i>in\u00a0vitro</i>. Compounds <b>1</b>-<b>6</b> displayed significant inhibitory activities on NO (nitric oxide) production induced by lipopolysaccharide in mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.98\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07 to 6.32\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11\u2009\u03bcM, which was comparable to hydrocortisone.
