Willow Leaf) during subculture and differentiation. The contents of DNA and RNA were higher in differentiating callus than that in subcultured callus. After day 12, the contents of DNA and RNA in differentiating callus rose continuously while the contents of DNA and RNA in subcultured callus remained constant. Changes in RNA species and its relationship to total RNA level were also analyzed. At the stage of shoot primordium formation in differentiating callus, the activity of RNase increased markedly and the synthesis rate of RNA increased continuously; while the RNase activity and the synthesis rate of RNA in subcultured callus were much lower during the same period. During the period of shoot growth, the synthesis rate of DNA in differentiating callus was elevated compared to that in subcultured callus. The results above suggested that the metabolism of nucleic acids in differentiating callus was more active than that in subcultured callus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Plant Physiology, Lanzhou University."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Q B", "Initials": "QB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "J Q", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "L H", "Initials": "LH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "H G", "Initials": "HG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Shi Yan Sheng Wu Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "0413570", "ISSNLinking": "0001-5334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nucleic Acids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nucleic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1414125"]}}]}
