Quercetin and quercetin-rich foods have been reported to have wide range of health promoting effects, especially in the prevention and management of several diseases; however, the subject of its solubility and bioavailability has limited its use. This section will therefore, consider quercetin as a food-rich flavonoid, the various food sources, the limitations in its use and new approaches at improving its solubility and bioavailability. The therapeutic potentials of quercetin at the prevention/management of some degenerative diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as the underlying biochemical mechanisms such as free radical scavenging and enzyme inhibition will also be discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals Unit, Department of Biochemistry, Federal University of Technology, P.M.B. 704, Akure, 340001, Ondo State, Nigeria.
