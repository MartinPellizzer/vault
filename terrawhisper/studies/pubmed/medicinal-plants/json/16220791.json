Smith.", "HPLC method was applied for quality and quantitative assessment of the pharmaceutical extracts from Swertia franchetiana H. Smith. The preparation of sample, the HPLC column, mobile phase, elution mode (isocratic or gradient) and gradient program were optimized in order to obtain HPLC profile. The HPLC system consisted of a SPD-1OAvp pump, SPD-M1OAVP photodiode-array detector (PAD), SIL-10ADVP auto injector. Data were acquired and processed with the CLASS-VP6.1 workstation. HPLC analysis was performed on a Kromasil C18 column (250 mm x 4. 6 mm ID, 5 microm) with methanol and water as mobile phase. The column temperature was set up at 40 degrees C and the flow-rate was 1 mL x min(-1). The reference solution of chemical standards and sample were injected into HPLC system, separately.", "The HPLC chromatographic fingerprinting of the total glycosides, showing 16 characteristic peaks which were partitioned into three parts: one peak in 0-10 min of retention time, nine peaks containing main 1-7 peaks in 10-15 min of retention time, 6 peaks in 15-30 min of retention time, was established from 10 lots of their products. By comparison of the retention time and the on-line UV spectra and their molecule weights of chemical standards, peak 1-7 were identified as swertiamarin (1), gentiopicroside (2), sweroside (3), isoorientin (4), swertisin (5), isoswertisin (6) and swetianolin (7), respectively. The ratios of peak area between 1-16 were in their extent. Moreover, comparison of the HPLC profiles of the total glycosides, the extracts prepared using another process and the plant indicated that they were closely related to each other.", "The HPLC profiles and quantitative assessment of the total glycosides from Swertia franchetiana H.
