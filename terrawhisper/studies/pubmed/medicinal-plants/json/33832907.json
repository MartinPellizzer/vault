Plants provided a back bone for the exploration of novel medicinal compounds. Therefore, chief focus of our study was to isolate the biologically active compounds from the plant source and evaluate their antidiarrheal potentials, as diarrhea is still the most dominant disease in developing countries. The isolation and structure elucidation of two new compounds were identified from methanolic and chloroform extracts of Psidium guajava (guava) leaves. Extracts of plants were acquired by successive maceration from dried powder. Castor oil induced diarrheal-model was used to evaluate the antidiarrheal activity and therapeutic response was endorsed to the suppression of normal and wet stools in Spraug Dawley rats. Through the series of fractionations, compound-A was obtained from methanolic extract and named 3-(4-amino 1,3,8-tri-OH 5,6-di-CH<sub>3</sub> 7-propyl 1,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a-octahydronaphthalen 2-yl) propanoic3-(4-NH3 7-butyl 1,3,8-tri-OH 5,6-di-CH<sub>3</sub> 1,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a-octahydronaphthalen 2-yl)propanoic anhydride. Compound-B was entitled 5-(3-hydroxy-1,4-di-CH3-1,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a-octahydronaphthalen-2-yl)pent-3-enoic acid was acquired from the chloroform extract. The structure elucidations of both compounds were interpreted through spectroscopic data, including EI-MS, FTIR, <sup>1</sup>HNMR and <sup>13</sup>C-NMR. The significant antidiarrheal activities were determined with crude extracts and isolated compounds. In inference, present study revealed that substantial antidiarrheal feature of guava is confined to the identified compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Abbas", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan/Multan Institute of Health Sciences, Multan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ansari", "ForeName": "Muhammad Tayyab", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Central Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Alvi", "ForeName": "Muhammad Nadeem", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahwalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Mohsin Abbas", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Imran Adrees College of Pharmacy, 3Km Daska Road, Sialkot, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "Syed Saeed Ul", "Initials": "SSU"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidiarrheals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8001-79-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Castor Oil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antidiarrheals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Castor Oil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Psidium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33832907"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
