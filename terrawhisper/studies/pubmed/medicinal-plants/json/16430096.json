Using this explant, axenic cultures were established with very less contamination (10%). MS medium with 2 mg l(-1) kinetin and 0.1 mg l(-1) 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid proved to be the best for multiple shoot induction. Maximum number (35) of shoot production was achieved in MS medium with 2 mg l(-1) benzylaminopurine. Rooting of shoots (86.7%) with maximum fasciculated roots (5) occurred on Knops medium containing iron and vitamins of MS medium with 2 mg l(-1) indole-3-butyric acid and 0.1% activated charcoal. Plant survival was 80% in four weeks after their removal from in vitro conditions. Per explant 34 hardened plants generated within 50 weeks. This protocol can be useful for large-scale clonal multiplication from immature floral buds with inflorescence axis and successfully used for germplasm conservation of this rare medicinal herb without destroying the mother plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, Sardar Patel University, Vallabh Vidyanagar 388 120, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Urvashi", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohan", "ForeName": "J S S", "Initials": "JS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Liliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16430096"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
