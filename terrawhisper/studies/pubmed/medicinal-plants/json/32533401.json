However, its therapeutic use is limited because of its severe side effects, especially hepatotoxicity attributed to oxidative stress. Nasturtium officinale R. Br (watercress or WC) has pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammation, and antioxidant activities. Therefore, the present study was design to assess effects of WC or its active ingredient, quercetin (QE), against CPA-induced hepatotoxicity. For this study, 49 male Wistar rats (200-250\u00a0g) were randomly selected and categorized into seven equal groups. The animals were pre- and post-treated with both hydroalcoholic extract of WC (500\u00a0mg/kg) and quercetin (75\u00a0mg/kg) for 10 consecutive days, and intraperitoneal administration of CPA (200\u00a0mg/kg) was performed on only day 10, one hour before the last dose of WC or quercetin. On day 11, all the animals were sacrificed, and their blood and liver were gathered for evaluation of the liver enzyme, hepatic oxidative stress markers, antioxidant enzymes activity, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. CPA significantly increased malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PCO) and nitric oxide (NO) levels and liver biomarkers. Otherwise, hepatic catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH), total thiol content (tSH), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were considerably lower than the control group. Results showed that WC has the ability to reduce the changes (MDA, PCO, FRAP, CAT, ALT and AST) and QE (MDA, PCO, AST) induced by CPA (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Histopathological finding confirmed the indicated results. These findings propose that WC and QE have protective effect against the CPA-induced hepatotoxicity by decreasing oxidative stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9166-419X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Doustimotlagh", "ForeName": "Amir Hossein", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8470-8844"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kokhdan", "ForeName": "Esmaeel Panahi", "Initials": "EP"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7334-3069"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vakilpour", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5786-051X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khalvati", "ForeName": "Bahman", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7240-6614"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Barmak", "ForeName": "Mehrzad Jafari", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9702-8880"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran. hossein.sadeghi@yums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Sadeghi", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3759-8192"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran. arash.asfaram@yums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Asfaram", "ForeName": "Arash", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "IR.YUMS.REC.1396.155", "Agency": "Yasuj University of Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mol Biol Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "0403234", "ISSNLinking": "0301-4851"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunosuppressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8N3DW7272P", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclophosphamide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclophosphamide"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Immunosuppressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intraperitoneal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nasturtium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32533401", "10.1007/s11033-020-05556-7", "10.1007/s11033-020-05556-7"]}}]}
