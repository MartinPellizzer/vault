Andrographis Herba, the dried aboveground part of Andrographis paniculata, has liver-protecting, bile secretion-promoting, heat-clearing, toxin-removing, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory effects. The quality instability caused by plant varieties, environment, and technology in the production of A. paniculata is a limiting factor for the sustainable development of this industry. Based on the research methods of molecular pharmacognosy and omics, the regulation of secondary metabolites of A. paniculata has become the key solution to the quality problems of A. paniculata. This paper summarized the recent research achievements in the molecular pharmacognosy of A. paniculata, including molecular identification of the resources, genetic diversity, multi-omics, biosynthesis of active compounds, and germplasm resource innovation, and prospected the future development trend in this field. In-depth research of molecular pharmacognosy of A. paniculata will provide more scientific and effective technical support for the development of its medicinal value, give new insights into the cultivation of new A. paniculata varieties, and promote the high-quality sustainable development of this industry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement of Guangdong Province, Crops Research Institute, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences Guangzhou 510640, China Guangdong Provincial Engineering and Technology Research Center for Conservation and Utilization of the Genuine Southern Medicinal Resources Guangzhou 510640, China College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University Wuhan 430070, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Long", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement of Guangdong Province, Crops Research Institute, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences Guangzhou 510640, China Guangdong Provincial Engineering and Technology Research Center for Conservation and Utilization of the Genuine Southern Medicinal Resources Guangzhou 510640, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jing-Yu", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement of Guangdong Province, Crops Research Institute, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences Guangzhou 510640, China Guangdong Provincial Engineering and Technology Research Center for Conservation and Utilization of the Genuine Southern Medicinal Resources Guangzhou 510640, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Shi-Qiang", "Initials": "SQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement of Guangdong Province, Crops Research Institute, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences Guangzhou 510640, China Guangdong Provincial Engineering and Technology Research Center for Conservation and Utilization of the Genuine Southern Medicinal Resources Guangzhou 510640, China College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University Wuhan 430070, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ji-Hua", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "English Abstract"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacognosy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Andrographis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Andrographis paniculata"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39041115", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20240412.101"]}}]}
