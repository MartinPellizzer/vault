The biological action of extracts of medicinal plants or their essential oils (EOs) is an emerging field of interest, since they could comprise a rich source of phytochemicals that can prove promising. In the present study, the biological activity and mechanism of action of the EO of <i>Foeniculum\u00a0vulgare</i> subsp. <i>piperitum</i> fruits (FVPEO) were investigated using MTT assays, morphological analyses and western blotting in MDA\u2011MB231 cells, a triple\u2011negative breast cancer cell line. The findings revealed that FVPEO could exert strong anticancer effects, causing a dose\u2011dependent inhibition of breast cancer MDA\u2011MB231 cell growth, accompanied with DNA condensation and fragmentation. The cytotoxic effect of FVPEO was counteracted by the addition of the antioxidant N\u2011acetylcysteine and was associated with a marked increase in reactive oxygen species and stress\u2011related proteins; such as manganese superoxide dismutase, c\u2011Jun, phospho\u2011c\u2011Jun N\u2011terminal kinase and nuclear factor E2\u2011related factor 2, and the latter's transcriptional targets, Heme oxygenase\u20111 and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). As evidenced by the activation of caspase\u20113 and fragmentation of poly(ADP\u2011ribose) polymerase\u20111, which are typical apoptosis markers, FVPEO promoted apoptotic cell death accompanied with an increase in phosphorylated H2A histone family member X and the activation of the NQO1/p53 axis. In combination, the present experiments provided evidence that FVPEO could represent a reservoir of biologically active compounds suitable for both cancer prevention and treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedicine, Neurosciences and Advanced Diagnostics, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Palermo, I\u201190127 Palermo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Lauricella", "ForeName": "Marianna", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technologies, Section of Chemistry, University of Palermo, I\u201190128 Palermo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Maggio", "ForeName": "Antonella", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technologies, Section of Chemistry, University of Palermo, I\u201190128 Palermo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Badalamenti", "ForeName": "Natale", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technologies, Section of Chemistry, University of Palermo, I\u201190128 Palermo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Bruno", "ForeName": "Maurizio", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technologies, Laboratory of Biochemistry, University of Palermo, I\u201190127 Palermo, Italy."}], "LastName": "D'Angelo", "ForeName": "Giovanni Danilo", "Initials": "GD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technologies, Laboratory of Biochemistry, University of Palermo, I\u201190127 Palermo, Italy."}], "LastName": "D'Anneo", "ForeName": "Antonella", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Mol Med Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "101475259", "ISSNLinking": "1791-2997"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Foeniculum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "22"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35642658", "10.3892/mmr.2022.12759", "243"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
