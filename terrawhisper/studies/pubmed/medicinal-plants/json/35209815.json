These plants are mostly exploited on a local basis as food or traditional remedies but could have a wider usage as nutraceuticals due to their richness in ellagitannins (ETs) and other phenolic compounds. ETs are hexahydroxydiphenoyl esters of carbohydrates and the largest group of hydrolysable tannins. They are distinctly antioxidant and bioactive compounds, and therefore, are considered as majorly responsible for the biological properties of ET-rich berries. The health benefits of ETs are mainly due to the release of ellagic acid and to their metabolic transformation by the gut microbiota into urolithins, and include, among others, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, anti-bacterial, and anticancer actions.", "Based on the literature searches in the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases, ethnobotanical, pharmaceutical, medicinal, and nutritional knowledge concerning the three berry species was covered. This includes empirical use of traditional preparations and experimental studies with various extracts and fractions from fruits and other plant portions, covering in vitro, preclinical, and clinical research.", "The data reveal a wide spectrum of potential uses in health care, providing in some cases an experimental confirmation of traditional uses.", "The examined berry species can act as nutraceutical foods, having positive effects on regular consumers but could also be exploited in more technological ways to produce food complements from ET-rich extracts."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, DIFAR, University of Genova, Viale Benedetto XV 3, 16132, Genova, Italy."}], "LastName": "Burlando", "ForeName": "Bruno", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth, Environment and Life Sciences (DISTAV), University of Genova, Corso Europa 26, 16132 Genova, Italy."}], "LastName": "Cornara", "ForeName": "Laura", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, DIFAR, University of Genova, Viale Cembrano 4, 16148 Genova, Italy."}], "LastName": "Boggia", "ForeName": "Raffaella", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Altitude"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "30"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35209815", "10.2174/0929867329666220224151938", "CMC-EPUB-121128"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
