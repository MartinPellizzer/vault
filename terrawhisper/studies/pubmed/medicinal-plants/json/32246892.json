The established screening database includes retention time, exact mass, fragments, isotopic pattern, and MS<sup>2</sup> spectra library of the target compounds and thus provides automated search and identification of the targets with a single injection. The nontargeted compounds in the samples are identified through the full MS scan and MS<sup>2</sup> data by using the Chemspider database and the data analysis in XCalibur, MassFrontier and TraceFinder software. In addition, this method possesses excellent quantitative capacity. The novel approach was applied to 65 batches of samples that are claimed as \"all-natural\" products having the antihypertensive function, among which nine batches were found to be positive. Multiple targeted and nontargeted antihypertensive adulterants were detected at levels ranging from 2.8 to 27.9\u00a0mg/g. The novel database and screening method demonstrated herein will be promising and powerful tools for rapid screening of antihypertensive adulterants in dietary supplements and herbal medicines."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
