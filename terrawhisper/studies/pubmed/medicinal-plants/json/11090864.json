One such therapy is ginseng root. However, in some other disease models, ginseng has proven efficacious. Ginseng improves learning and memory in rats, and reduces neuronal death following transient cerebral ischemia. These effects of ginseng have been related to increases in the expression of nerve growth factor and its high affinity receptor in the rat brain, and antioxidant actions, inter alia. Since such actions could be beneficial in ALS as well, we studied the effect of ginseng (Panax quinquefolium), 40 and 80 mg/Kg, in B6SJL-TgN(SOD1-G93A)1Gur transgenic mice. The ginseng was given in drinking water, from age 30d onwards. We measured the time to onset of signs of motor impairment, and survival. There was no difference between the two ginseng groups (n=6, 6) in either measure. However, compared to controls (n=13), there was a prolongation in onset of signs (116d vs. 94d, P<0.001), and survival (139d vs. 132d, P<0.05). These experiments lend support to the use of ginseng root in ALS. Future experiments using this model could examine for symptomatic effects of ginseng, measure the effect of specific ginsenosides (which differ between ginseng species), and elucidate their mechanisms of action."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "McMaster University Medical Centre, Rm 4U7, 1200 Main St W, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada L8N 3Z5."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "DeSilva", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Turnbull", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Neurol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375403", "ISSNLinking": "0022-510X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Sod1 protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Sod1 protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase-1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Progression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Transgenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase-1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Survival Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11090864", "10.1016/s0022-510x(00)00421-4", "S0022-510X(00)00421-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
