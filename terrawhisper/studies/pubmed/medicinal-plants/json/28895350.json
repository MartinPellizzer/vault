Combined of different methods including study of historical records from the local chronicles and historical accounts of past event in Hubei, Sichuan, Chongqing, Henan and Shaanxi provinces, interviewing face to face with the old traditional Chinese workers and folk doctors in 20 downtowns and countrysides, such as, Laohekou, Lichuan, Fangxian, Xixia, Neixiang, and Ankang, and collecting a few plants of \"Jinchai\" for taxonomic identification. The traditional Chinese medicine names of \"Jinchai\", \"Jinchai Shihu\" were widely used by the local people from the eastern Chongqing, western Hubei, northeasten Sichuan, southeastern Shaanxi, western Henan. Those two names were frequently found in the local Chronicles and historical accounts of past event, even in the local daily life such as folk songs and stories. The botanical identification results showed that a endemic species of D. flexicaule is the original materials of the traditional Chinese medicine names \"Jinchai\" and \"Jinchai Shihu\", and this species are also called \"Longtoujin\", \"Renzijin\", \"Huanzijin\" and \"Longtoufengweijin\" by the local people. The dried artifactitious specimens of D. flexicaule are traditionally named as \"Jinerhuan\". The botanic resource plants of the traditional Chinese medicine names of \"Jinchai\", \"Jinchai Shihu\" are the endemic species of D. flexicaule that is distributed mainly in central areas of China including eastern Chongqing, western Hubei, northeasten Sichuan, southeastern Shaanxi, and western Henan, rather than D. nobile as referring in both Chinese and English version of Flora of China, and in official recorded serious versions of The Chinese Pharmacopoeia since 1977. In order to avoid confusion in the traditional Chinese medicine dendrobiums industry, the Chinese name of D. nobile is suggested as \"Biancao Shihu\", which characterized one stem feature of this species, and the traditional Chinese medicine names \"Jinchai\" or \"JinchaiShihu\" is suggested to refer to the species D. flexicaule."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Cinsese Materia Medica, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource, Center for Chinese Materia Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Ming", "ForeName": "Xing-Jia", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Cinsese Materia Medica, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource, Center for Chinese Materia Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Bo-Ran", "Initials": "BR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Cinsese Materia Medica, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource, Center for Chinese Materia Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Ji-Feng", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Cinsese Materia Medica, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource, Center for Chinese Materia Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhi-Wei", "Initials": "ZW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Import and Export Management Center of Endangered Species, State Forestry Administration, Beijing 100714, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Liang-Chen", "Initials": "LC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Luohu Agricultural Development Co., Ltd., Chongqing 404038, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Yi-Bo", "Initials": "YB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28895350", "10.4268/cjcmm20161033"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
