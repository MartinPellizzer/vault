In this study, six 6-alkoxy (10b, 15-19), and twelve 6-hydroxy-alkyl amine (20a-20l) derivatives of braylin (11 and 12) were synthesized to delineate its structural requirement for vasorelaxing activity. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for vasorelaxation response in preconstricted intact rat Main Mesenteric Artery (MMA). The compounds showed l-type VDCC channel blockade depended and endothelium-independent vasorelaxation within the range of Emax\u00a0<\u00a050.00-96.70 % at 30\u00a0\u00b5M. Amongst all, 6-alkoxy derivatives were more active than 6-hydroxy-alkyl amine derivatives. The structural refinements about braylin showed that deletion of its methoxy group or homologation beyond ethoxy group presented deleterious effect on vasorelaxation response of braylin. Interestingly, substituting the ethoxy group in 10b presented the best activity and selectivity towards l-type VDCC channel blockade, a specific target cardiovascular function."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
