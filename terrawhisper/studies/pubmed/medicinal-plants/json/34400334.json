The disease caused by Vibrio spp. (vibriosis) is considered the most devastating, which has made it the most feared bacterial disease in the shrimp sector. In aquaculture, several strategies have already been applied to control Vibrio strains, including chemicals, probiotics, antibiotics, natural products from plants, including plant oils; hence, there has been considerable attention for using plants in shrimp aquaculture to provide sustainable, eco-friendly and safe compounds, such as alkaloids, saponins, terpenoids and flavonoids for replacing chemical compounds and antibiotics in current aquaculture. Medicinal plants may also have immunostimulating activity, increase growth and resistance in shrimps. The present paper aims to review the inhibition of Vibrio spp. in shrimp by medicinal plants, using both in vitro or/and in vivo techniques. Several medicinal plants appear capable of inhibiting growth of Vibrio pathogens outside living shrimp or in the body of shrimp, through enhancing growth and immune capacity when shrimps are fed or injected with them. In the current review Gracilaria spp. (Gracilariaceae family) and Sargassum spp. (family Sargassaceae) have been used most for in vitro and in vivo experiments. Among the terrestrial plants, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Psidium guajava, Rhodomyrtus tomentosa, and Syzygium cumini (Myrtaceae family) had significant activity against Vibrio."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
