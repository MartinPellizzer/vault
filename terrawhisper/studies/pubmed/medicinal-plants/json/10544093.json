In these, the region encoding both the large (L) and small (S) viral coat proteins was replaced by the equivalent region from bean pod mottle virus (BPMV). The hybrid RNA-2 molecules were able to replicate in cowpea protoplasts in the presence of CPMV RNA-1. Though processing of the hybrid polyproteins by the CPMV-specific 24K proteinase at the site between the 58/48K and L proteins could readily be achieved, no processing at the site between the L and S coat proteins could be obtained even when the sequence of amino acids between the two coat proteins was made CPMV-like. As a result, none of the hybrids was able to form functional virus particles, and they could not infect cowpea plants. Comparison with the processing of the L-S site in cis in reticulocyte lysates demonstrated that the requirements for processing are more stringent in trans than in cis. The results suggest that the L-S cleavage site is defined by more than just a linear sequence of amino acids and probably involves interactions between the L-S loop and the beta barrels of the viral coat proteins."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 1999 Academic Press."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Virus Research, John Innes Centre, Colney Lane, Norwich, NR4 7UH, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Clark", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bertens", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wellink", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shanks", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lomonossoff", "ForeName": "G P", "Initials": "GP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Virology", "NlmUniqueID": "0110674", "ISSNLinking": "0042-6822"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Northern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Capsid"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Comovirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Biosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Processing, Post-Translational"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Structure, Secondary"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virus Replication"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10544093", "10.1006/viro.1999.9947", "S0042-6822(99)99947-6"]}}]}
