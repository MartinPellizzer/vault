This study was designed to assess the prevalence of traditional medicine use and associated factors of its use during childbearing. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and individual interviews were conducted with 140 women. The results indicated that majority of women (79%) were still using traditional medicine during childbearing for different purposes even with the availability of free health care services. The most commonly used traditional medicine used during pregnancy was isihlambezo. Umhlabelo herbal mixture was the most cited remedy used for post-partum recovery. For infant care, imbiza was the only used traditional remedy. The results of this study highlight the need for health care workers to be aware of this practice and be able to provide mediation during ante-natal care classes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Faculty of Science, Agriculture and Engineering, University of Zululand, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Ramulondi", "ForeName": "Mmbulaheni", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Faculty of Science, Agriculture and Engineering, University of Zululand, South Africa."}], "LastName": "de Wet", "ForeName": "Helene", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Faculty of Science, Agriculture and Engineering, University of Zululand, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Ntuli", "ForeName": "Nontuthuko R", "Initials": "NR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Nigeria", "MedlineTA": "Afr J Reprod Health", "NlmUniqueID": "9712263", "ISSNLinking": "1118-4841"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37585018", "10.29063/ajrh2022/v26i1.7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
