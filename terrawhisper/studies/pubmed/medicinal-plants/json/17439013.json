In the conventional procedure, chromatograms are integrated and the heights or areas of several peaks are used in a supervised pattern recognition method to confirm the authenticity of the product. We propose a new section approach in analysing chromatograms, where chromatograms are split into sections, which are described by four variables (number of peaks in the section, average retention time of peaks in the section, total area of peaks in the section and average area of peaks in the section), and these variables are then used in statistical analysis. The method is especially useful when the peaks on the chromatogram are not well separated and it is not easy to link individual peaks on one chromatogram with corresponding peaks on other chromatograms. In comparison with the standard procedure, our approach in analyzing chromatographic data of willow-herb (Epilobium and Chamaenerion spp.) extracts was more objective, gave better results and was also easier to perform."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, Askerdeva 7, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia. marko.obradovic@ffa.uni-lj.si"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Obradovic", "ForeName": "Marko", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krajsek", "ForeName": "Simona Strgulc", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dermastia", "ForeName": "Marina", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kreft", "ForeName": "Samo", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochem Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "9200492", "ISSNLinking": "0958-0344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Data Interpretation, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Capillary"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Epilobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17439013", "10.1002/pca.960"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
