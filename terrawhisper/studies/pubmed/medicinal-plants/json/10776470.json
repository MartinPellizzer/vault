Diclofenac (DICLO), a prostaglandin (PG) synthesis inhibitor was used to confirm the role of prostaglandin in restraint stress-induced elevation of central 5-HT correspondingly confirmed by elevation of plasma corticosterone and modification of the above anti-stress agents. Pg, Diaz and DICLO per se did not modify brain and hypothalamic 5-HT in control rats. But they attenuated stress-induced elevation of brain and hypothalamic 5-HT. Anti-stress action of both Pg and Diaz reflected by inhibition of stress-induced elevation of brain and hypothalamic content of 5-HT as also stress-induced concurrent elevation of plasma corticosterone were further diminished by DICLO. The mediatory action of 5-HT in anti-stress effects of Pg and Diaz may be modulated through prostaglandins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Dr. B.C.
