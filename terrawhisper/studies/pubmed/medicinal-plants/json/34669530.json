This review emphasizes the different aspects of <i>Ploygonatum</i> based research starting from its bioactive compounds, their structural characterization, various extraction methods, as well as biological activities. In view of its integral use as an essential medicinal plant, our review emphasizes on its promising food applications both as an ingredient and as a whole food, and its improved health benefits with potential for agricultural and environmental relevance are also discussed. As we collated the recent research information, we present the main challenges and limitations of the current research trend in this area which can upgrade the further expansion of <i>Polygonatum</i>-related research that will strengthen its economic and accessible nutritional value in the food and health industries. By highlighting the need for the unattended species, this review not only fills existing research gaps, but also encourages the researchers to find new avenues for the natural production of bio-based functional materials and the development of highly functional and health-promoting foods for disease prevention and treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food and Biological Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao-Li", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food and Biological Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Food Production and Safety, School of Biological Science and Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Run-Hui", "Initials": "RH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food and Biological Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Fan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food and Biological Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Food Production and Safety, School of Biological Science and Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ni", "ForeName": "Zhi-Jing", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8441-6537"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food and Biological Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Food Production and Safety, School of Biological Science and Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Thakur", "ForeName": "Kiran", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biological Science and Technology, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shaoyun", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food and Biological Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Food Production and Safety, School of Biological Science and Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jian-Guo", "Initials": "JG"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1729-209X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food and Biological Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Food Production and Safety, School of Biological Science and Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Zhao-Jun", "Initials": "ZJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Functional Food"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polygonatum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "18"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34669530", "10.1080/10408398.2021.1993783"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
