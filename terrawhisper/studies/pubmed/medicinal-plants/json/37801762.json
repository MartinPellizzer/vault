Many research interests have been directed toward the biological activities of the phytochemical constituents of garlic. However, prospects of its bioactive proteins and peptides have been understudied to date. With the advances in food proteomics/peptide research, a review of studies on garlic bioactive proteins and peptides, especially on their nature, extraction, and biological activities, is timely. Garlic has been reported to express several proteins, endogenous and protein-derived peptides with interesting bioactivities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-proliferative, antiviral, anti-hypertensive and immunomodulatory activities, suggesting their therapeutic and pharmacological potentials. Compared to legumes, the low protein contents of garlic bulbs and their low stability are possible limitations that would hinder future applications. We suggest adopting heterologous expression systems for peptide overproduction and stability enhancement. Therefore, we recommend increased scientific interest in the bioactive peptides of garlic and other spice plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
