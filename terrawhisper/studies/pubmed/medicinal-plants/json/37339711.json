To address the need for reliable anti-coronavirus therapeutics, we screened 16 active phytochemicals selected from medicinal plants used in traditional applications for respiratory-related illnesses.", "An initial screen was completed using HCoV-OC43 to identify compounds that inhibit virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) and cell death inhibition. Then the top hits were validated in vitro against both HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 by determining virus titer in cell supernatant and virus-induced cell death. Finally, the most active phytochemical was validated in vivo in the SARS-CoV-2-infected B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J mouse model.", "The phytochemicals lycorine (LYC), capsaicin, rottlerin (RTL), piperine and chebulinic acid (CHU) inhibited HCoV-OC43-induced cytopathic effect and reduced viral titres by up to 4 log. LYC, RTL and CHU also suppressed virus replication and cell death following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In vivo, RTL significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2-induced mortality by \u223c40% in human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-expressing K18 mice.", "Collectively, these studies indicate that RTL and other phytochemicals have therapeutic potential to reduce SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroimmunology Section, Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, 903 S. 4th St., Hamilton, MT, USA.
