Seven phenotypic characters of 33 samples of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis collected from Yunnan,Guizhou and Sichuan were determined by conventional methods,and the principal component analysis and cluster analysis were used to analyze the diversity of the samples. The parissaponin( polyphyllin \u2160,\u2161,\u2165,\u2166) content of the samples were detected by HPLC,and analyzed by cluster analysis. Correlation analysis of the phenotypic characters and the parissaponin content was performed. There were significant differences in seven phenotypic characters between wild and transplanted samples of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis from different habitats,with high phenotypic diversity and abundant genetic variation. The results of principal component analysis showed that leaf shape index was the main factor of morphological variation of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis. Cluster analysis showed that the phenotypic characters of wild and transplanted P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis could not be completely separated. The content of saponins in wild and transplanted samples from different habitats was quite different. Saponins content of 93. 94% samples met the criterion of Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2015 edition,and the overall quality was relatively steady. The results of independent sample t-test showed that there was no significant difference of all the active ingredient between wild and transplanted samples,and it couldn't be used to distinguish between wild and transplanted samples. It is the same as the results of cluster analysis. The results of correlation analysis showed that the phenotypic traits of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis were correlated with its medicine quality,and the total content of saponins was positively correlated with leaf length and leaf shape index( r = 0. 389,0. 441; P<0. 05). Yunnan,Guizhou and Sichuan are suitable for the growth of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis. And the transplaned P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis can be used as the same as the wild ones completely. The results provide reference for the protection and selective breeding of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "the Chongqing Engineering Laboratory for Green Cultivation and Deep Processing of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area's Medicinal Herbs,College of Food and Biological Engineering,Chongqing Three Gorges University Chongqing 404120,China College of Pharmacy and Chemistry,Dali University Dali 671000,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "the Chongqing Engineering Laboratory for Green Cultivation and Deep Processing of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area's Medicinal Herbs,College of Food and Biological Engineering,Chongqing Three Gorges University Chongqing 404120,China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy and Chemistry,Dali University Dali 671000,China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "the Chongqing Engineering Laboratory for Green Cultivation and Deep Processing of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area's Medicinal Herbs,College of Food and Biological Engineering,Chongqing Three Gorges University Chongqing 404120,China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Dong-Qin", "Initials": "DQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy and Chemistry,Dali University Dali 671000,China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "the Chongqing Engineering Laboratory for Green Cultivation and Deep Processing of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area's Medicinal Herbs,College of Food and Biological Engineering,Chongqing Three Gorges University Chongqing 404120,China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chong-Tao", "Initials": "CT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "the Chongqing Engineering Laboratory for Green Cultivation and Deep Processing of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area's Medicinal Herbs,College of Food and Biological Engineering,Chongqing Three Gorges University Chongqing 404120,China."}], "LastName": "Pang", "ForeName": "Yi-Fei", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "the Chongqing Engineering Laboratory for Green Cultivation and Deep Processing of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area's Medicinal Herbs,College of Food and Biological Engineering,Chongqing Three Gorges University Chongqing 404120,China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Nong", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Melanthiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31602873", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190527.102"]}}]}
