Incubation without NADPH, or with low concentrations (0.01 mM or lower), gave only naringenin as a reaction product. With NADH (1 mM), the major product was naringenin accompanied by a small quantity of liquiritigenin. The initial product of the assay with 1 mM NADPH was isoliquiritigenin, indicating a reaction catalyzed by 6'-deoxychalcone synthase (DOCS). Subsequent formation of liquiritigenin was attributed to the presence of chalcone isomerase in the crude extract. The results constitute the first demonstration in vitro of DOCS activity which, in G. echinata cells and other leguminous plants, is involved in the biosynthesis of retrochalcone and 5-deoxyisoflavonoid-derived phytoalexins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kitasato University, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ayabe", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Udagawa", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Furuya", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "6'-deoxychalcone synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T82SFG1584", "NameOfSubstance": "indicine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Acyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell-Free System"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Induction"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Yeasts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3355160", "10.1016/0003-9861(88)90362-1", "0003-9861(88)90362-1"]}}]}
