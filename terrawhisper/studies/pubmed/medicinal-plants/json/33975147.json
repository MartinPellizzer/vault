To fully understand the response of andrographolide biosynthesis to different N forms in Andrographis paniculata, the plants were fed with nutritional solution containing sole N source of nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), urea or glycine (Gly), and the growth, carbon (C) and N metabolisms and andrographolide biosynthesis were analyzed. We found that plants grown in urea and Gly performed greater photosynthetic rate and photosynthetic N use efficiency (PNUE) than those grown in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. Organic N sources reduced the activities of enzymes involving in C and N metabolisms such as glutamine synthase (GS), glutamate synthase (GOGAT) and NADH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (NADH-GDH), invertase (INV), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) and glycolate oxidase (GO), resulting in reduced depletion of carbohydrates and increased starch accumulation. However, they enhanced andrographolide content by up-regulating the key genes in its biosynthetic pathway including HMGR, DXS, GGPS and ApCPS. Besides, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> decreased leaf SPAD value, contents of soluble protein and amino acids and GO activity, but increased photosynthetic rate and contents of soluble sugar and starch in comparison to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Andrographolide biosynthesis was also up-regulated. The results revealed that increasing accumulation of carbohydrates, especially starch, was beneficial to the biosynthesis of andrographolide; organic N sources decreased carbohydrate depletion by reducing N metabolism, and promoted plant growth and andrographolide biosynthesis synergistically."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.
