Preliminary screening of phytochemicals showed that the extract of Ood-saleeb had flavonoids and phenolics. The significant activities in all antioxidant assays were observed in the extract of Ood-saleeb in comparison with the standard antioxidant with respect to dose of Ood-saleeb. Incredible activities to scavenge reactive oxygen species were also observed by the extract of Ood-saleeb. The IC50 values of all factors were determined using ascorbic acid as a standard. The inductive coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) was employed for the estimation of trace elements in Ood-saleeb extract. The concentrations of up to 18 elements were detected successfully. Silicon was found in high concentration (85.3\u00a0\u03bcg/g) while lithium was in low concentration (3\u00a0ng/g). The trace elements in the sample were found at different percentage levels which play a key role in the treatment of diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, PO Box 2457, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Raish", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Ajaz", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alkharfy", "ForeName": "Khalid M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, PO Box 2457, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Al-Jenoobi", "ForeName": "Fahad I", "Initials": "FI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, PO Box 2457, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Al-Mohizea", "ForeName": "Abdullah M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, PO Box 2457, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Mohsin", "ForeName": "Kazi", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ahamad", "ForeName": "Syed Rizwan", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Quality Assurance Unit, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Naushad", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, PO Box 2457, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia. faiyazs@fastmail.fm."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Excellence in Biotechnology Research (CEBR), King Saud University, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia. faiyazs@fastmail.fm."}], "LastName": "Shakeel", "ForeName": "Faiyaz", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biol Trace Elem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7911509", "ISSNLinking": "0163-4984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Paeonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26758866", "10.1007/s12011-015-0607-x", "10.1007/s12011-015-0607-x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
