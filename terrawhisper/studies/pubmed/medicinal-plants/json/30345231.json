The present study examined the cytotoxic effects of <i>F. gummosa</i> in terms of induction of apoptosis and radiosensitivity in HeLa cells.", "In order to determine <i>F. gummosa</i> cytotoxicity in HeLa cells, the cells were incubated with different concentrations of the plant resin (0-1000 \u00b5g/ml) for 24, 48 and 72 hr. Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay. The role of apoptosis in <i>F. gummosa</i> cytotoxicity was investigated using flow cytometry following propidium iodide (PI) staining of DNA. For radiosensitivity assessment, <i>F. gummosa</i>-treated cells were exposed to 2 Gy \u03b3-rays, and cytotoxicity was determined in irradiated and non-irradiated (control) groups by MTT and the synergism factor was calculated.", "<i>F. gummosa</i> decreased cell viability in HeLa cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that apoptosis is involved in <i>F. gummosa</i>-induced cytotoxicity. Co-administration of <i>F. gummosa</i> and radiotherapy<i>,</i> showed that this plant at non-toxic low doses, could result in almost 5-fold increment in sensitization of cells towards radiation-induced toxicity.", "The concurrent use of <i>F. gummosa</i> and radiation increases radiosensitivity and cell death. Therefore, <i>F. gummosa</i> can be considered as a potential radiosensitizer agent against cervical cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Faculty of Sciences, Mashhad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Forouzmand", "ForeName": "Seyed Hamid", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Toxicology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mousavi", "ForeName": "Seyed Hadi", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Faculty of Sciences, Mashhad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vazifedan", "ForeName": "Vahid", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nourbakhsh", "ForeName": "Mahnaz", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Faculty of Sciences, Mashhad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Chamani", "ForeName": "Jamshidkhan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Toxicology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hoseini", "ForeName": "Azar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fanipakdel", "ForeName": "Azar", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Avicenna J Phytomed", "NlmUniqueID": "101586220", "ISSNLinking": "2228-7930"}, "CoiStatement": "We wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ashkenazi A, Dixit VM.
