Two doses of rinbacin extract (26.25 g/l and 52.50 g/l) were administered in the rats' drinking water for 13 weeks, and various toxicologic indices tested. Histological study of the kidneys was also carried out at the expiration of the test period. Rinbacin at both dose sizes significantly (p<0.05) increased the absolute and relative kidney weights. Also the serum HCO3- level was significantly (p<0.05) increased, while the serum K+ level was decreased significantly at both dose levels. Only the high dose significantly (p<0.05) increased the serum urea level of the rats. Histological study showed that rinbacin at both dose sizes caused renal pathologic changes, which included necrosis and cellular infiltration of glomeruli and epithelia of the tubules. The effects were less marked in the low dose than the high dose group. Chronic administration of rinbacin extract induces nephrotoxicity in young rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, College of Health Sciences, Nnamdi Azikiwe University Nnewi, Anambra State, Nigeria. connice@infoweb.abs.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Afonne", "ForeName": "Onyenmechi Johnson", "Initials": "OJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Orisakwe", "ForeName": "Orish Ebere", "Initials": "OE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dioka", "ForeName": "Chudi Emma", "Initials": "CE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Obi", "ForeName": "Ejeatuluchukwu", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ezejiofor", "ForeName": "Tobias", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Asomugha", "ForeName": "Lasbery", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ukoha", "ForeName": "Ukoha", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12186402", "10.1248/bpb.25.1022"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
