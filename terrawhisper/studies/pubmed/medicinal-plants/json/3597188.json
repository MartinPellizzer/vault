Each mixture was fed in ad libitum amounts to six crossbred wether lambs weighing 35 to 45 kg. The effect of increasing proportion of legume in mixtures on dry matter digestibility (DMD), neutral detergent fiber digestibility (DNDF) and digestible dry matter intake (DDMI) differed with species combination. For all combinations, a quadratic regression (P less than .05) for DMD and DNDF indicated a small, negative associative effect for mixtures of grasses and legumes compared with pure species. Dry matter intake (DMI) showed a quadratic increase with level of legume inclusion, indicating a positive associative effect. The observed increase of DMI was approximately 6 to 7% over predicted values with 25 or 50% legume in the mixture. Intake of NDF also showed a quadratic response to level of legume, but lambs tended to eat to a fairly constant intake of 42 to 43 g NDF/kg wt.75. Mineral utilization (apparent absorption, retention) differed (P less than .05) with cutting but not species combination, and generally improved with increasing legume content in the mixture. With the exception of calcium retention (negative quadratic effect), there was little evidence for significant associative effects between grasses and legumes in mineral utilization."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Reid", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Templeton", "ForeName": "W C", "Initials": "WC", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ranney", "ForeName": "T S", "Initials": "TS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thayne", "ForeName": "W V", "Initials": "WV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Anim Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8003002", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8812"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3597188", "10.2527/jas1987.6461725x"]}}]}
