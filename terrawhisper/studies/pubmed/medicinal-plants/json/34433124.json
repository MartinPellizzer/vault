Aiming to facilitate in-depth and global characterization of the chemical compositions of PG, a profiling method based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with ion mobility quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/IM-QTOF-MS) was conducted. Consequently, as many as 187 compounds were plausibly or unambiguously identified. Most importantly, phospholipids (PLs) were first observed and identified in PG. Due to their widely confirmed bioactivities, an analysis scheme was developed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry combined with the online Patern\u00f2-B\u00fcchi reaction (HILIC-PB-MS/MS). The fatty acyl chains and C=C locations of 180 PLs molecular species, which fell into four classes, were unprecedently characterized. This exposure strategy of multi-type constituents greatly enriches the chemical profiling of PG, and helps promoting the further development of therapeutic agents and nutraceutical products from PG."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
