A pot experiment was conducted, wherein S. miltiorrhiza was subjected to Cd stress for six weeks with foliar application of 100\u00a0mg/L ZnO QDs. Physiological analyses demonstrated that compared to Cd stress alone, ZnO QDs improved biomass, reduced Cd accumulation, increased the content of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoids), and enhanced the levels of essential nutrient elements (Ca, Mn, and Cu) under Cd stress. Furthermore, ZnO QDs significantly lowered Cd-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, including H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, and MDA, while enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, APX, and GSH-PX). Additionally, ZnO QDs promoted the biosynthesis of primary and secondary metabolites, such as total protein, soluble sugars, terpenoids, and phenols, thereby mitigating Cd stress in S. miltiorrhiza. At the molecular level, ZnO QDs were found to activate the expression of stress signal transduction-related genes, subsequently regulating the expression of downstream target genes associated with metal transport, cell wall synthesis, and secondary metabolite synthesis via transcription factors. This activation mechanism contributed to enhancing Cd tolerance in S. miltiorrhiza. In summary, these findings shed light on the mechanisms underlying the mitigation of Cd stress by ZnO QDs, offering a potential nanomaterial-based strategy for enhancing Cd tolerance in medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
