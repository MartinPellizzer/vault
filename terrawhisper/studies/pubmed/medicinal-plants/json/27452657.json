Besides, finding place as health supplements, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, herbal tea etc. there has been a global insurgence of interest, including India, leading to enormous research/activities in the area of medicinal plants.", "The article is aimed to provide the effort and initiatives of ICMR towards research on medicinal plants and its contributions on consolidation of Indian research on medicinal plants that are very relevant and important in the national context.", "The various initiatives undertaken by ICMR on research on traditional medicines/medicinal plants in the past are reviewed and documented in this article.", "The multi-disciplinary, multicentric research initiatives of ICMR have resulted in validation of traditional treatment Kshaarasootra (medicated Ayurvedic thread) for anal fistula, Vijayasar (heart wood of Pterocarpus marsupium Roxb.) for diabetes mellitus, encouraging micro- and macrofilaricidal activity of Shakotak (stem bark of Streblus asper Lour.) in experimental studies an iridoid glycosides fraction isolated from root/rhizomes of Picrorhiza kurroa Royle ex Benth. (designated as Picroliv) for viral hepatitis. Other developmental and compilation of research works on Indian medicinal plants have resulted in publications of the thirteen volumes of quality standards, comprising of 449 Indian medicinal plants; three volumes of 90 phytochemical reference standards; fifteen volumes of review monographs on 4167 medicinal plant species; and one publication each on perspectives of Indian medicinal plants for management of liver disorders, lymphatic filariasis and diabetes mellitus (details available at http://www.icmr.nic.in/mpsite).", "The ICMR efforts assume special significance in the light of multifaceted use of medicinal plants, and the need of better drugs and remedies for various diseases. Further, the indigenous system of medicine, and the plant drugs, could promise to provide both concepts of therapy, as well as therapeutic agents in the areas, where modern system of medicines has few answers. The developement of quality standards and review monographs also help the regulators, pharmacopoeial bodies and drug industry towards generation of quality herbal drugs or traditional medicine preparations. These initiatives are also in favour of the World Health Organisation advocating herbal medicines as a valid alternative system of therapy in the form of phytomedicines or herbal drugs or herbal drug preparations or herbal medicinal products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
