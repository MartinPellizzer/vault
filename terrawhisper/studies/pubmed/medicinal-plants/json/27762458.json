Despite several narrative reports on the antidepressant properties of MPLR, it appears that there are no systematic reviews to summarize its outcome effects. Therefore, the aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of MPLR adjuvant therapy in patients with PSD. Seven databases were extensively searched from January 2000 until July 2016. Randomized control trials (RCTs) involving patients with PSD that compared treatment with and without MPLR were taken into account. The pooled effect estimates were calculated based on Cochrane Collaboration's software RevMan 5.3. Finally, 42 eligible studies with 3612 participants were included. Overall, MPLR adjuvant therapy showed a significantly higher effective rate (RR\u2009=\u20091.23; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.19, 1.27; p\u2009<\u20090.00001) compared to those without. Moreover, the administration of MPLR was superior to abstainers regarding Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score changes after 3\u2009weeks (WMD\u2009=\u2009-4.83; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-6.82, -2.83; p\u2009<\u20090.00001), 4\u2009weeks (WMD\u2009=\u2009-3.25; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-4.10, -2.40; p\u2009<\u20090.00001), 6\u2009weeks (WMD\u2009=\u2009-4.04; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-5.24, -2.84; p\u2009<\u20090.00001), 8\u2009weeks (WMD\u2009=\u2009-4.72; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-5.57, -3.87; p\u2009<\u20090.00001), and 12\u2009weeks (WMD\u2009=\u2009-3.07; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-4.05, -2.09; p\u2009<\u20090.00001). In addition, there were additive benefits in terms of response changes for the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and other self-rating scores. No frequently occurring or serious adverse events were reported. We concluded that there is supporting evidence that adjuvant therapy with MPLR is effective in reducing the depressive symptoms and enhancing quality of life for patients with PSD. More well-designed RCTs are necessary to explore the role of MPLR in the treatment of PSD.
