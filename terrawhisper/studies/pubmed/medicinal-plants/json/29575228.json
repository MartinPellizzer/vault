Ovid Medline, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library were searched for herbal medicines with both pharmacological and clinical evidence of psychotropic activity. This updated review now covers clinical trial evidence for 24 herbal medicines in 11 psychiatric disorders. High-quality evidence was found to exist for the use of Piper methysticum (Kava), Passiflora spp. (passionflower) and Galphimia glauca (galphimia) for anxiety disorders; and Hypericum perforatum (St John's wort) and Crocus sativus (saffron) for major depressive disorder. Other encouraging herbal medicines with preliminary evidence include Curcuma longa (turmeric) in depression, Withania somnifera (ashwagandha) in affective disorders, and Ginkgo biloba (ginkgo) as an adjunctive treatment in Schizophrenia. Although depression and anxiety are commonly researched, many other mental disorders still require further prospective investigation. Although the previous review suggested increasing the adjunctive study of select herbal medicines with pharmaceuticals, this was still only found to sparingly occur in research designs. Aside from this, future focus should involve the incorporation of more biomarker analysis, in particular pharmacogenomics, to determine genetic factors moderating response to herbal medicines."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9287-8854"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NICM Health Research Institute, School of Science and Health, Western Sydney University, Westmead, NSW, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, The Melbourne Clinic, Professorial Unit, ARCADIA Research Group, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia."}], "LastName": "Sarris", "ForeName": "Jerome", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Anxiety"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Depression"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mental Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29575228", "10.1002/ptr.6055"]}}]}
