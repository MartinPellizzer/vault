Distilled water and ethanol were used as negative control and glyphosate 2% as a positive control. The determination of phenolic compounds present in the infusions was carried by liquid chromatography in a UHPLC apparatus.", "Chamomile infusions at concentrations of 10 and 40\u202fg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> of inflorescence reduced mitotic index and emphasized antiproliferative activity on the cell cycle of Allium cepa.
