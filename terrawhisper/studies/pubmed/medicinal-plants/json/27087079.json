The effects of CD extract on penis erectile response were investigated in present study. After castration surgery, rats were treated intragastrically with CD extract (0.45, 0.90 and 1.8 g/kg) daily for four weeks. Penis erectile response was measured and the serum hormones were assayed at the end of the experiment. It was evaluated that the erectile latency became longer and the erectile duration shorter significantly in castrated rats compared to sham operated controls. However, CD extract shortened the erectile latency and prolonged the erectile duration to minimize the negative effects of castration. At the dosage of 0.9 g/kg, CD extract regulated the serum luteinizing hormone concentration approach to normal level in castrated rats. These findings indicated that CD facilitated the penis erectile response and modulated the serum hormone level to some extent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food and Health Engineering Research Center of State Education Ministry, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food and Health Engineering Research Center of State Education Ministry, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Wen Ting", "Initials": "WT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food and Health Engineering Research Center of State Education Ministry, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Zhuang", "ForeName": "Yan Lei", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food and Health Engineering Research Center of State Education Ministry, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jian Shuang", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food and Health Engineering Research Center of State Education Ministry, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-67-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Luteinizing Hormone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cistanche"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Erectile Dysfunction"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Luteinizing Hormone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Orchiectomy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Penile Erection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Recovery of Function"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27087079"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
