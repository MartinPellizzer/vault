The results showed that there were no significant differences in the colors of root bark but significant or very significant differences\uff08P<0.05,P<0.01\uff09in the colors of transverse section between the wild and cultivated G. uralensis. Compared with those in the cultivated G. uralensis, the contents of liquiritin, isoliquiritin isoliquiritigenin and the contents of ammonium glycyrrhizinate, glycyrrhetinic acid were obviously significant or remarkably significant in the wild G. uralensis.The correlation results showed that there was a significant or very significant correlation between the colors and the effective component contents.
