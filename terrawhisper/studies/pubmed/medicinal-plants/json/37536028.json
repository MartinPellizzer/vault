By using the determined natural radioactivity concentrations in the collected plant samples, the number of radiological doses that people could be exposed by consuming these plants was calculated. As a result of the study, <sup>226</sup>Ra, <sup>232</sup>Th, and <sup>4</sup>\u00a0K radioactivity concentration ranges of the plant samples were found be 14.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.27-59.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.12 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup>, 1.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04-50.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.76 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup> and 207.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034.09-826.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025.40 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.
