In addition, hyperjaponols A and B were identified as racemates. The structures and absolute configurations of the undescribed compounds were determined by comprehensive MS, NMR spectroscopy, and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations. The cytotoxic effects of the isolated compounds on two human tumour cell lines (HEL and MDA-MB-231) were evaluated by the MTT assay. Eighteen compounds showed good inhibitory activities against the HEL cell line, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 3.53-18.7\u202f\u03bcM, while nine compounds exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against the MDA-MB-231 cancer cell line, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 4.92 to 10.75\u202f\u03bcM. Their preliminary structure-activity relationship of the isolated compounds was also discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
