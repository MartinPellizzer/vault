To introduce the TLC plate into the DART ion source at a constant velocity, a syringe pump was employed. The DART-MS total ion current chromatogram was recorded for the entire TLC plate. The concentration of each lignan compound was calculated from the calibration curve established with standard compound.", "Gomisin A, gomisin N and schisandrin were well separated on a silica-coated TLC plate and the specific ion current chromatograms were successfully acquired from the TLC-DART-MS system. The TLC-DART-MS system for the quantitation of natural products showed better linearity and specificity than TLC densitometry, and consumed less time and solvent than conventional HPLC method.", "A hyphenated system for the quantitation of phytochemicals from crude herbal drugs was successfully established.
