The study explored 33 plant species (with their local names, indigenous applications, sources/origins, parts of plants used, bioactive compounds present, process of preparing medicines from the plants) belonging to 28 families have been reviewed thoroughly. Some examples are, <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> (<i>Tsuinrinaro</i>, Periwinkle), <i>Acacia pennata</i> (<i>Chakrangaing</i>, Ballikhadira), <i>Adhatoda vasica</i> (<i>Kicharangnaro,</i> Malabar-nut), <i>Ageratum conzyoides</i> (<i>Imchenriza</i>, Billy-goat-weed,/Tropical-white-weed), <i>Alstonia scholaris</i> (<i>Lazarongpang</i>, Blackboard), <i>Rauvolfia serpentina</i> (<i>Per-mozutong</i>, Indian-snakeroot), etc. Plant based drugs are very popular and effective in Nagaland from ancient times but thorough-documentation with scientific-background of effectiveness, active chemical-compounds present, their action-mechanism, etc., are still scanty. Such review can be of useful for pharmacologist, phyto-chemists to a broad group of researchers and may lead to discovery of new sources of novel medicines through traditional therapeutic knowledge."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, National Institute of Technology Nagaland, Dimapur, India."}], "LastName": "Luikham", "ForeName": "Soching", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1278-3431"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, National Institute of Technology Nagaland, Dimapur, India."}], "LastName": "Bhattacharyya", "ForeName": "Jhimli", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38372281", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2315594"]}}]}
