The inhibitory potential of compound <b>7</b> was indicated by the proper binding and the perfect energy of -21.10\u2009kcal/mol compared to sorafenib (-21.22) in the molecular docking studies. Next, six MD simulation studies over 100\u2009ns (RMSD, RMSF, SASA, RoG, hydrogen bonding, and distance between the center of mass) confirmed the accurate interaction of compound <b>7</b> with the catalytic pocket of VEGFR-2. Similarly, an MM-GBSA established proper binding showing an exact total binding energy of -36.95\u2009\u00b1\u20093.03\u2009kcal/Mol. Additionally, the MM-GBSA experiment indicated the vital amino acids in the binding process. Types and number of interactions of compound <b>7</b> with catalytic pocket of VEGFR-2 were determined through Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler (PLIP). As a new compound, the DFT was employed to optimize the molecular structure of compound <b>7</b>. The DFT experiments also verified the interaction features of compound <b>7</b> with the VEGFR-2 active site. <i>In silico</i> ADMET experiments revealed the general drug-likeness of compound <b>7.</b> Fascinatingly, the <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> examinations were consistent with the <i>in silico</i> experiments as compound <b>7</b> inhibited the VEGFR-2 enzyme with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 37\u2009nM. Captivatingly, compound <b>7</b> inhibited both MCF-7 and HCT 116 cancer cells exhibiting IC<sub>50</sub> values of 10.56 and 7.07\u2009\u00b5M exhibiting excellent selectivity indexes of 9.04 and 13.50, respectively.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
