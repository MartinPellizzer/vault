Silver nanoparticles were biosynthesized with <i>Salvia miltiorrhiza,</i> Chinese medicinal herb and assessed for its anticarcinogenic property. Synthesis of AgNPs was characterized by several studies such as UV-absorbance and it shows peak values in the range of 425-445\u2009nm. The sizes of the nanoparticles are confirmed by dynamic light scattering analysis and it shows 100\u2009nm. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) was to confirm the shape and Ag particles are present in the synthesized materials. FTIR analysis to find out the active biomolecules located in the surface of the synthesized particles. This AgNPs from <i>S. miltiorrhiza</i> inhibits the growth of <i>Bacillus subtillis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli,</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumonia</i>. Furthermore, the anticancer potential of AgNPs is examined in prostate adenocarcinoma (LNCaP) cell lines. In this study, we found the AgNPs effectively induces cytotoxicity, ROS and apoptosis by modulation of intrinsic apoptoic Bcl2, Bclxl, Bax and Caspase 3 protein expressions in LNCap cell lines. Based on the study, synthesis of AgNPs from <i>S. miltiorrhiza</i> shows eco-friendly and it exhibits antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Urology, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, the Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Science and Technology, \u00a0 Kunming , Yunnan , China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Urology, The Second People's Hospital of Yunnan Province , Kunming , Yunnan , China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiaodong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Industrial Biotechnology, Bharath University , Chennai , Tamilnadu , India."}], "LastName": "Samuel Ravi", "ForeName": "Samson Oliver Abraham", "Initials": "SOA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d R&D Wing, Lifeline Hospital, \u00a0 Chennai , Tamilnadu , India."}], "LastName": "Ramachandran", "ForeName": "Arunkumar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al-Qura University , Makkah , Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Aziz Ibrahim", "ForeName": "Ibrahim Abdel", "Initials": "IA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al-Qura University , Makkah , Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "M Nassir", "ForeName": "Anmar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6414-3404"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "g Department of Urological Surgery No.2, The First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University , Kunming , Yunnan , China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Jiapei", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101594777", "ISSNLinking": "2169-1401"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Green Chemistry Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Prostatic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31299869", "10.1080/21691401.2019.1638792"]}}]}
