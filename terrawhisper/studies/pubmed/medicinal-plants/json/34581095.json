H9 c2 cells were treated with 100 \u03bcg\u00b7mL~(-1) P. orientale extract and then they and the corresponding nuclei, mitochondria and Golgi bodies were collected at the set time. After protein precipitation, UPLC-MS/MS was used to determine concentrations of isoorientin, orientin, quercetin, vitexin and kaempferol-3-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside in the whole cells and subcellular structures. Also, related pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. The results showed that the peak time was 8 h for all these components. Orientin, vitexin, quercetin and isoorientin have high affinities to nuclei and mitochondria, while the affinity of kaempferol-3-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside is higher with mitochondria compared to nuclei. It is suggested that these chemical components of P. orientale may mainly act on nuclei or mitochondria to exert pharmacological effects of protecting cardiomyocytes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou Province, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou Province, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Na", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou Province, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Lyu", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou Province, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou Province, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yong-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chun-Hua", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polygonum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34581095", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210618.202"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
