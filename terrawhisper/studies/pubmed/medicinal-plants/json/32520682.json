In the last decade, enormous research is conducted to explore the medicinal properties of salidroside; this research reported many activities like anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-aging, anti-diabetic, anti-depressant, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, etc. Objective: Despite its multiple pharmacological effects, a comprehensive review detailing its metabolism and therapeutic activities is still missing. This review aims to provide an overview of the metabolism of salidroside, its role in alleviating different metabolic disorders, diseases and its molecular interaction with the target molecules in different conditions. This review mostly concentrates on the metabolism, biological activities and molecular pathways related to various pharmacological activities of salidroside.", "Salidroside is produced by a three-step pathway in the plants with tyrosol as an intermediate molecule. The molecule is biotransformed into many metabolites through phase I and II pathways. These metabolites, together with a certain amount of salidroside may be responsible for various pharmacological functions. The salidroside based inhibition of PI3k/AKT, JAK/ STAT, and MEK/ERK pathways and activation of apoptosis and autophagy are the major reasons for its anti-cancer activity. AMPK pathway modulation plays a significant role in its anti-diabetic activity. The neuroprotective activity was linked with decreased oxidative stress and increased antioxidant enzymes, Nrf2/HO-1 pathways, decreased inflammation through suppression of NF-\u03baB pathway and PI3K/AKT pathways. These scientific findings will pave the way to clinically translate the use of salidroside as a multi-functional drug for various diseases and disorders in the near future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences, School of Natural Sciences, Shiv Nadar University, Greater Noida, India."}], "LastName": "Magani", "ForeName": "Sri Krishna Jayadev", "Initials": "SKJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, GITAM Institute of Science, GITAM, Visakhapatnam, India."}], "LastName": "Mupparthi", "ForeName": "Sri Durgambica", "Initials": "SD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neelakanta Vidyapeeth, Hyderabad, India."}], "LastName": "Gollapalli", "ForeName": "Bhanu Prakash", "Initials": "BP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya, Bilaspur, India."}], "LastName": "Shukla", "ForeName": "Dhananjay", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Dr. Bhanvar Singh Porte Government College, Pendra Bilaspur, India."}], "LastName": "Tiwari", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Govt. of India, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Gorantala", "ForeName": "Jyotsna", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Biochemistry, GITAM Institute of Science, GITAM, Visakhapatnam, India."}], "LastName": "Yarla", "ForeName": "Nagendra Sastry", "Initials": "NS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Indira Gandhi National Tribal University, Amarkantak, India."}], "LastName": "Tantravahi", "ForeName": "Srinivasan", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Metab", "NlmUniqueID": "100960533", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M983H6N1S9", "NameOfSubstance": "rhodioloside"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoxia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rhodiola"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Wounds and Injuries"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32520682", "10.2174/1389200221666200610172105", "CDM-EPUB-107244"]}}]}
