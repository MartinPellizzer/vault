FESEM/EDS illustrated irregularly shaped particles in the plant powders except for Withania, which had round to oval shape particles. XRD analysis displayed a semi-crystalline nature of powders, except for Asparagus, which showed amorphous behavior. Both methanol and ethanol plant extracts exhibited significantly higher antioxidants, total phenols, and cell viability. Amongst, optimized composite flour (OCF) methanolic extract demonstrated the highest total phenolic content (69.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11\u00a0\u03bcg GAE/ml), potent cell viability against A549 cells (3.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15% at 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), and strong free-radical scavenging activity (48.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.67 at 200\u00a0\u03bcg/ml). GCMS and FTIR analyses of the methanolic extracts demonstrated the presence of essential phytoconstituents and functional groups. In silico studies of the phytocomponents, ethyl isoallocholate, 3-Deoxy-d-mannoic lactone, and 4,5-Diamino-2-hydroxypyrimidine suggested good binding affinity against BAX, P53, and EGFR proteins with no toxicity and a good drug score."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
