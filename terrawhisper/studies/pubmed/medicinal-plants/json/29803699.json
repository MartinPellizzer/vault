The methanolic seed extract (MSE) showed promising antifungal activity against Candida albicans (6.25mg/mL), Candida glabrata (3.12mg/mL) and Candida parapsilosis (12.50mg/mL) among all the fungal strains tested. Combination of the MSE with the well-known commercial antifungal drugs amphotericin B (Amp B), nystatin (NYS) and fluconazole (FLC) resulted in the killing of C.\u00a0glabrata at non-inhibitory concentrations, i.e., 0.35\u03bcg/mL for Amp B, 0.55\u03bcg/mL for NYS and 1.19\u03bcg/mL for FLC. Notably, MSE caused cell wall damage of C.\u00a0glabrata cells, as confirmed by confocal microscopy, flowcytometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The MSE was fractionated by thin layer chromatography (TLC). TLC-bioautography was used to determine the active compounds present in the MSE. Column chromatography was used to separate the potential active compounds from the MSE. Furthermore, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) andfourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to identify the phytocomponents of the MSE. These experiments revealed 13-docosenamide/9-octadecenamide/trans-13-docosenamide (89.70%) as being the predominant compound using a chloroform/methanol solvent system for the separation. Interestingly, the MSE also exhibited less significant cytotoxicity at the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against mammalian cells (HeLa and HEK293). This study suggests that the MSE of P.\u00a0emodi can be used for the treatment of C.\u00a0glabrata infection."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
