In addition, the inhibitory effects of ZJC on nitric oxide production, intracellular reactive oxygen species production, pro-inflammatory mediator expression and prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) production were determined by using LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. The anti-oxidant activity of ZJC was assessed using 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid assay.", "ZJC aqueous extract showed significant suppressive effect on paw edema in rats at 100mg/kg. Moreover, ZJC aqueous extract decreased the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and significantly decreased the PGE2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6 production in LPS-activated macrophages in dose-dependent manners. ZJC aqueous extract inhibited the mRNA expression of these inflammatory cytokines as well. Furthermore, ZJC aqueous extract was found as an anti-oxidant and could inhibit ROS production in the LPS-induced cells.", "These findings show the potential of ZJC aqueous extract as a naturally occurring COX-2 inhibitor to reduce inflammation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
