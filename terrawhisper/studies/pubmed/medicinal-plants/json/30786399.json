(Asteraceae) (pot marigold or English marigold) is an ornamental species grown in gardens and as potted plants for the production of cut flower. It was also used in ancient Greek, Roman, Arabic, and Indian cultures as a medicinal herb as well as a dye for fabrics, foods, and cosmetics. During the summer of 2007, severe outbreaks of a previously unknown powdery mildew were observed on plants in several gardens near Biella (northern Italy). Both surfaces of leaves of infected plants were covered with dense, white mycelia and conidia. As the disease progressed, infected leaves turned yellow and died. Mycelia and conidia also were observed on stems and flower calyxes. Conidia were hyaline, ellipsoid, born in short chains (four to six conidia per chain), and measured 27.0 to 32.1 (31.4) \u00d7 12.9 to 18.4 (18.2) \u03bcm. Conidiophores measured 49 to 77.3 (67.2) \u00d7 8 to 13.3 (10.8) \u03bcm and showed a foot cell measuring 44 to 59 (51.9) \u00d7 9.3 to 12.6 (11.3) \u03bcm followed by one shorter cell measuring 15.6 to 18.9 (17.6) \u00d7 10.4 to 13.6 (12.2) \u03bcm. Fibrosin bodies were present. Chasmothecia were spherical, amber colored, with a diameter of 89 to 100 (94.5) \u03bcm. Each chasmothecium contained one ascus with eight ascospores. On the basis of its morphology, the causal agent was determined to be a Podosphaera sp. (2). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified using the primers ITS4/ITS6 and sequenced. BLASTn analysis (1) of the 588 bp showed a 100% homology with the sequence of Podosphaera xanthii (2). The nucleotide sequence has been assigned GenBank Accession No. EU100973. Pathogenicity was confirmed through inoculations by gently pressing diseased leaves onto leaves of healthy C. officinalis plants. Five plants were inoculated. Five noninoculated plants served as control. Plants were maintained in a greenhouse at temperatures ranging from 20 to 26\u00b0C. Eleven days after inoculation, typical symptoms of powdery mildew developed on inoculated plants. Noninoculated plants did not show symptoms. The pathogenicity test was carried out twice. To our knowledge, this is the first report of powdery mildew on C. officinalis in Italy. C. officinalis was previously described as a host to Sphaerotheca fuliginea (synonym S. fusca) in Great Britain (4) as well as in Romania (3).
