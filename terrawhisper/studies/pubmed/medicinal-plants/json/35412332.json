To date, Fusarium wilt continues to cause concern in industrial and medicinal cannabis cultivation worldwide. During a 3-year period (2018 to 2021), <i>Fo</i> strains were isolated from medical cannabis plants (<i>Cannabis sativa</i>) exhibiting wilt symptoms that were cultivated in numerous commercial farms in Israel. A diverse set of these strains was subjected to molecular phylogenetic analyses to assess their genetic diversity and to compare them with other f. sp. <i>cannabis</i> isolates included in prior studies. Maximum likelihood bootstrap analysis of a partial translation elongation factor (<i>TEF1</i>) dataset, which included 24 f. sp. <i>cannabis</i> sequences, revealed that the 11 strains from Israel comprised five <i>TEF1</i> haplotypes. Two of the haplotypes from Israel were identical to isolates previously reported from British Columbia and California and British Columbia and Ontario. Overall, the 24 f. sp. <i>cannabis</i> sequences included 12 unique <i>TEF1</i> haplotypes. These were phylogenetically diverse, suggesting that pathogenicity to <i>C. sativa</i> may have evolved independently within the <i>F. oxysporum</i> complex. Pathogenicity tests of the Israeli strains were confirmed by Koch's postulates assays. Strains of the five different f. sp. <i>cannabis TEF1</i> haplotypes all caused wilt in cannabis seedlings but with varying levels of aggressiveness. The same isolates that originated from asymptomatic infected mother plants were found in wilted cuttings indicating that the pathogen can be spread via propagation material."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Plant Pathology and Weed Research, ARO, The Volcani Institute, Rishon LeZion, 7505101, Israel."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Robert H.
