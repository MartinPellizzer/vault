Methanol:methylene chloride (1:1) extracts of these red algae were orally administered (500 or 1000 mg/kg/day) to female rats from day 1 to day 7 of pregnancy. Nulliparous female (200-225 g) and male (200-250 g) mixed bred albino rats of proven fertility were used. Compared to polyvinylpyrolidone lower- and higher-dose control treatments, none of the crude extract (CE) significantly (p 0.05) inhibited the quantal pregnancy. Furthermore, both doses of the CE of Jania sp. and the lower dose of CE of Gracilaria corticata had no effect on any of the reproductive parameters determined. The higher dose of Gracilaria corticata and both doses of Gelidiella acerosa extracts produced significant postcoital contraceptive activities without any marked side effects. The higher dose of the CE of Gracilaria corticata significantly (p 0.05) reduced (by 35.0%) the number of postcoital uterine implantation sites, and this treatment produced a significant (p 0.05) enhancement (by 152.5%) of preimplantation loss. In contrast, CE of Gelidiella acerosa significantly (lower dose p 0.01; higher dose p 0.001) increased the number of resorption sites in a dose-related manner (p 0.001): lower dose = 23 out of 44 embryos and higher dose = 58 out of 58 embryos. CE of Gelidiella acerosa also caused a significant (lower dose p 0.01 ; higher dose p 0.001) elevation in postimplantation loss (lower dose by 43.8% and higher dose by 98%). As a consequence, there was a significant reduction (lower dose p 0.05; higher dose p 0.01) in the litter index of the rats treated with this CE (lower dose by 43.5% and higher dose by 100%). On the other hand, extract made from Jania sp. had no significant postcoital contraceptive action. These findings indicate that marine red algae are potential postcoital contraceptive drugs."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["098852", "00234505"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: CONTRACEPTION."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Animals, Laboratory", "Asia", "Clinical Research", "Contraception", "Contraceptive Agents", "Contraceptive Agents, Female", "Contraceptive Mode Of Action", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Family Planning", "Fertility Control, Postcoital", "Health", "Health Services", "Implantation", "Implantation Suppression", "Medicine", "Plants, Medicinal", "Postimplantation Phase", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy, First Trimester", "Preimplantation Phase", "Reproduction", "Research Report", "Southern Asia", "Sri Lanka"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "7805379", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1995", "Month": "02", "Day": "02"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "08", "Day": "25"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0010-7824", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "50", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1994", "Month": "Sep"}}, "Title": "Contraception", "ISOAbbreviation": "Contraception"}, "ArticleTitle": "Post-coital contraceptive activity of crude extracts of Sri Lankan marine red algae.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "291", "EndPage": "299", "MedlinePgn": "291-9"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["This study investigates the potential of marine red algae as a source for post-coital contraceptive agents using three varieties: Gracilaria corticata, Gelidiella acerosa and Jania sp.
