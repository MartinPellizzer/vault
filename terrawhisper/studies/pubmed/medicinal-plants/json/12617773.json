The N-glycosidase activity of curcin was determined by characterization of R-fragment in gel. A cell-free system, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, was introduced to quantify the inhibitory activity of curcin on protein biosynthesis.", "The curcin had a powerful inhibitory action upon protein synthesis in reticulocyte lysate with an IC50 (95 % confidence limits) value of 0.19 (0.11-0.27) nmol/L. The IC50 (95 % confidence limits) of curcin on SGC-7901, Sp2/0, and human hepatoma was 0.23 (0.15-0.32) mg/L, 0.66 (0.35-0.97) mg/L, 3.16 (2.74-3.58) mg/L, respectively. Curcin was found to have no toxic to Hela cells and normal cells (MRC). After the rRNA of ribosome was treated with curcin and aniline at acidic condition, a cleaved R-fragment of approximately 450 nt appeared, but this fragment did not occur after treatment with curcin only. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of curcin, ricin A-chain and trichosanthin revealed that there were relatively high similarities among them. The percentages of homology between curcin and ricin A chain, between curcin and trichosanthin were found to be 54 % and 57 % respectively. Especially, the conserved residues forming the active sites of the A chain of ricin and trichosanthin occurred in curcin.", "Curcin has an obvious antitumor effect and its mechanisms are related to the N-glycosidase activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Synthesis Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60318-52-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Trichosanthin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9009-86-3", "NameOfSubstance": "Ricin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.2.-", "NameOfSubstance": "N-Glycosyl Hydrolases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.2.22", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Jatropha"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "N-Glycosyl Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Synthesis Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reticulocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Ricin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Alignment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Trichosanthin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12617773"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
