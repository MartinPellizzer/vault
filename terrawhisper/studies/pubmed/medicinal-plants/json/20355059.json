Several mechanisms have been proposed for the antidiabetic effect of medicinal plants such as inhibition of carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes, manipulation of glucose transporters, beta-cell regeneration and enhancing insulin-releasing activity. The present investigation evaluated the possible mechanism of action through which Ficus racemosa stem bark (Moraceae) exerts its hypoglycemic effect using suitable in vitro techniques.", "Ficus racemosa bark (FRB) exhibited significantly higher (P < or = 0.01) glucose-binding capacity than wheat bran (WB) and acarbose (ACB) consequently showed significantly higher (P < or = 0.01) retardation of glucose diffusion compared to WB and ACB. In case of amylolysis kinetics the liberation of glucose was greatly inhibited by FRB, as reflected by a significantly lower (P < or = 0.01) glucose diffusion rate in the system containing FRB compared to the control and acarbose. Furthermore, FRB significantly increased (P < or = 0.01) the rate of glucose transport across the yeast cell membrane and also in isolated rat hemi-diaphragm.", "The findings indicate F. racemosa bark to possess strong hypoglycemic effect and hence can be utilized as an adjunct in the management of diabetes mellitus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Studies in Food Science and Nutrition, Manasagangotri, University of Mysore, Mysore 570 006, India. fayaz ahmed09@yahoo.co.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Faiyaz", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Urooj", "ForeName": "Asna", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T58MSI464G", "NameOfSubstance": "Acarbose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acarbose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ficus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Bark"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Yeasts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20355059", "10.1002/jsfa.3828"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
