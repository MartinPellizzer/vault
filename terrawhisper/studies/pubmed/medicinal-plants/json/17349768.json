The introduction of on-line purity monitoring in HSCCC has greatly improved the efficiency of this technique by overcoming the drawbacks of post-purification sample handling in HSCCC isolation. The effluent from the outlet of HSCCC was split into two parts, and one was collected, while the other was introduced directly through a switch valve into a HPLC-DAD system for purity monitoring. Using this method the desired fractions with high purities could be collected. From 600 mg partially purified extract, 165.6 mg neomangiferin and 292.8 mg mangiferin with purities of 98.9 and 99.5%, respectively, were obtained with a two-phase solvent system composed of n-butanol-water (1:1, v/v) by increasing the flow-rate of the mobile phase stepwise from 1.0 to 2.2 ml min(-1) after 210 min. A 17.1mg 5-HMF with purity of 96.6% was also isolated for the first time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory for Pharmaceutical Metabolite Research, School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, No. 325 Guohe Road, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Tingting", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Zhenyu", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Guorong", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Jinyong", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chai", "ForeName": "Yifeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yutian", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Biomed Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "8309336", "ISSNLinking": "0731-7085"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Furans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "neomangiferin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1M84LD0UMD", "NameOfSubstance": "mangiferin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anemarrhena"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Countercurrent Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Furans"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthones"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17349768", "10.1016/j.jpba.2007.01.050", "S0731-7085(07)00089-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
