Many oceanic creatures, particularly algae, plants, bacteria, yeast, fungi, cyanobacteria, actinomyces, invertebrates, animals and sponges can survive under extreme circumstances. They can biogenerate a broad spectrum of phytochemicals/metabolites, including proteins, peptides, alkaloids, flavonoids, polyphenols, carbohydrate polymers, polysaccharides, sulfated polysaccharides, polysaccharide-protein complexes such as carrageenan, fucoidanase, fucoidan, carboxymethyl cellulose, poly-\u03b3-glutamic acid, sugar residues with proteins, melanin, haemocyanin, etc). These products exhibit exclusive advantages that offer pioneering roles in the eco-friendly fabrication of several nanoparticles (NPs) i.e., Ag, Au, Ru, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Cobalt (III) Oxide (Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), ZnO and Ag@AgCl within a single phase. Importantly, marine organisms can biosynthesize NPs in two modes, namely extracellular and intracellular. Biosynthesized NPs can be characterized using various methodologies among them, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Taken together, this review focuses on the green synthesis of metallic, metallic oxides and nonmetallic NPs utilizing extracts/derivatives from marine organisms based on eco-friendly green biogenic procedures. Moreover, significant attention is given to the medicinal and industrial importance of such marine organisms mediated NPs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
