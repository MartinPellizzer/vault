Dicarboximide fungicides (DCFs) have been intensively used to control this disease for decades in China, and offer excellent efficacy. The resistance of phytopathogenic pathogens against DCFs are reportedly selected in fields; however, the DCF resistance of <i>A. alternata</i> from <i>D. officinale</i> is not well understood. The isolates of <i>A. alternata</i> with low procymidone resistance (Pro<sup>LR</sup>) were detected in the commercial orchards of <i>D. officinale</i> in China in 2018 and biochemically characterized in this study. The result showed that the Pro<sup>LR</sup> isolates were selected in the commercial orchards with a resistance frequency of 100%, and no significant difference in mycelial growth, sporulation, and virulence was observed among the Pro<sup>LR</sup> and procymidone-sensitive (Pro<sup>S</sup>) isolates. A positive cross-resistance pattern was exhibited between procymidone and iprodione. Results of amino acid sequence alignment of <i>AaOS-1</i> from the tested isolates showed that all of the Pro<sup>LR</sup> genotypes could be categorized into two groups, including group I (mutations at <i>AaOs-1</i>) and group II (no mutation). Under procymidone (5.0 \u00b5g/ml) treatment conditions, the <i>AaOs-1</i> expression levels increased in the Pro<sup>S</sup> isolates and ranged from approximately 2.94- to 3.69-fold higher than those under procymidone-free conditions, while the <i>AaOs-1</i> expressions of the Pro<sup>LR</sup> isolates were significantly lower than those in the Pro<sup>S</sup> isolates under the same conditions. The data indicated that the mutations at <i>AaOs-1</i> are involved in the DCF resistance of <i>A. alternata</i> selected in the <i>D. officinale</i> orchards."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3596-4304"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Key Laboratory of Pesticide, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210095 China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Weicheng", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8513-4766"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Key Laboratory of Pesticide, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210095 China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Chunxia", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2857-6944"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Key Laboratory of Pesticide, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210095 China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Lingling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7882-1085"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Key Laboratory of Pesticide, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210095 China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Wenchan", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Key Laboratory of Pesticide, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210095 China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bingran", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Key Laboratory of Pesticide, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210095 China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Fengjie", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Key Laboratory of Pesticide, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210095 China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Mengdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Key Laboratory of Pesticide, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210095 China."}], "LastName": "Lou", "ForeName": "Tiancheng", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Key Laboratory of Pesticide, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210095 China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Pengcheng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Key Laboratory of Pesticide, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210095 China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Huanhuan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Key Laboratory of Pesticide, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210095 China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Changjun", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210095 China."}], "LastName": "Xiang", "ForeName": "Zengxu", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}, "SupplMeshList": ["Alternaria alternata"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Alternaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Fungal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33048591", "10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1246-RE"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
