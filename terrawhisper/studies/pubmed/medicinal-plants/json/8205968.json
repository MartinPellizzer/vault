In view of earlier literature indicating that garlic antagonized lead toxicity, we have investigated the possible use of garlic feeding to clean up lead contents from chickens which had been exposed to natural or experimental lead pollution and consequently eliminate one of the sources of lead pollution to human consumers. Groups of chickens (10 birds each) were given lead alone (lead acetate equivalent to 5 mg lead/kg B.W.) or both lead and garlic simultaneously or lead followed by garlic post-treatment or garlic alone or distilled water. Lead concentrations were reduced in muscle and liver tissues of chickens given both lead and garlic simultaneously or as a post-treatment. Reduction in tissue-lead concentrations were greater in birds given garlic as a post-treatment than those given garlic simultaneously with lead. The results indicate that garlic contain chelating compounds capable of enhancing elimination of lead. Garlic feeding can be exploited to safeguard human consumers by minimizing lead concentrations in meat of food animals which had been grown in a lead polluted environment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept.
