Bituminaria bituminosa (L.) C.H.Stirt is known as a source of several phytochemicals and therefore used in folk medicine as a vulnerary, cicatrising, disinfectant agent. Characteristic metabolites found in B. bituminosa are furanocoumarins and pterocarpans, which are used in cosmetics and as chemotherapeutic agents. Here we address the question whether AMF inoculation might affect positively the synthesis of these phytochemicals. B. bituminosa plants were inoculated with different AMF and several metabolites were assessed during full vegetative stage and flowering phase. Pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids), polyphenols and flavonoids were spectrophotometrically determined; specific isoflavones (genistein), furanocoumarins (psoralene and angelicin), pterocarpans (bitucarpin A and erybraedin C) and plicatin B were assessed with HPLC; leaf volatile organic compounds were analysed using SPME and identified by GC-MS. During the vegetative stage, the inoculated plants had a high amount of furanocoumarins (angelicin and psoralen) and pterocarpans (erybraedin C and bitucarpin A). The analysis of volatile organic compounds of inoculated plants showed different chemical composition compared with non-mycorrhizal plants. Given the important potential role played by furanocoumarins and pterocarpans in the pharmaceutical industry, AMF inoculation of B. bituminosa plants may represent a suitable biotechnological tool to obtain higher amounts of such metabolites for pharmaceutical and medicinal purposes."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3943-2797"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agriculture, Food and Environment, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdepartmental Research Center Nutrafood - Nutraceuticals and Food for Health, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}], "LastName": "Pistelli", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}], "LastName": "Ulivieri", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}], "LastName": "Giovanelli", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Agricultural Biology and Biotechnology, CNR, Milan, Italy."}], "LastName": "Avio", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agriculture, Food and Environment, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdepartmental Research Center Nutrafood - Nutraceuticals and Food for Health, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}], "LastName": "Giovannetti", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdepartmental Research Center Nutrafood - Nutraceuticals and Food for Health, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}], "LastName": "Pistelli", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101148926", "ISSNLinking": "1435-8603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Carotenoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carotenoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mycorrhizae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Psoralea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Secondary Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28749560", "10.1111/plb.12608"]}}]}
