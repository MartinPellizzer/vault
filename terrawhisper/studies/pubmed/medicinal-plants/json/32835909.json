Synthesis process of MIPs was optimized by discussion of functional monomers, porogens and the molar ratio of template- functional monomer-cross linker. Then, MIPs were prepared with polydatin as the template, 4-vinyl pyridine as the functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethyl acrylate as the cross linker, acetonitrile as the porogen and the molar ratio of template-monomer-cross linker at 1:10:20. Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer were used to inspect macroscale and chemical bond of MIPs. Adsorption capability and selectivity of MIPs to polydatin were investigated by carrying out the static, dynamic and selective experiments. The results showed MIPs performed high adsorption ability and selectivity to polydatin, indicating MIPs could be used to separate and enrich polydatin from the complex systems. Finally, MIPs were applied as the adsorbent for isolation and purification of polydatin from the extract of Polygoni Cuspidati Rhizoma et Radix, rats' plasma and urine samples. MIPs were successfully used to separate polydatin from the Polygoni Cuspidati Rhizoma et Radix and recovery ranged from 89.2% to 91.6%. The maximum concentration of polydatin in rats' plasma and urine samples was 2.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0748\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> and 2.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.485\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Moreover, to compare with the MIPs method, organic solvent methods were used to analyze the polydatin in rats' plasma and urine samples. The results illustrated MIPs method was effective and selective for enrichment of polydatin from the medicinal plants and biological samples."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
