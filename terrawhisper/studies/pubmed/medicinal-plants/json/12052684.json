It is processed from a larger precursor protein, containing a 23 amino acid amino (N)-terminal sequence (pre sequence) and a 19 amino acid carboxy (C)-terminal extension (pro sequence). Various constructs of the TCS gene were expressed in transgenic tobacco plants to determine the effects of the amino- and carboxy-coding gene sequences on TCS expression and host toxicity in plants. The maximum TCS expression levels of 2.7% of total soluble protein (0.05% of total dry weight) were obtained in transgenic tobacco plants carrying the complete prepro-TCS gene sequence under the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA promoter. The N-terminal sequence matched the native TCS sequence indicating that the T. kirilowii signal sequence was properly processed in tobacco and the protein translation inhibitory activity of purified rTCS was similar to native TCS. One hundred-fold lower expression levels and phenotypic aberrations were evident in plants expressing the gene constructs without the C-terminal coding sequence. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing recombinant TCS exhibited delayed symptoms of systemic infection following exposure to Cucumber mosaic virus and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Local lesion assays using extracts from the infected transgenic plants indicated reduced levels of TMV compared with nontransgenic controls."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of California at Davis, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krishnan", "ForeName": "Rajesh", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDonald", "ForeName": "Karen A", "Initials": "KA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dandekar", "ForeName": "Abhaya M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jackman", "ForeName": "Alan P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Falk", "ForeName": "Bryce", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8411927", "ISSNLinking": "0168-1656"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60318-52-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Trichosanthin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cucumovirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Vectors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenesis, Insertional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plasmids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Biosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ribosomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco Mosaic Virus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transformation, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Transgenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Trichosanthin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12052684", "10.1016/s0168-1656(02)00058-5", "S0168165602000585"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
