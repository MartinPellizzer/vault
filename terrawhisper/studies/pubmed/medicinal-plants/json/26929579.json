Although they grow in different agro-climatic conditions, they are often considered to be synonymous with each other.", "The present study was aimed to systematically classify both the species CS and CR through their morphological features and chemical profiling using liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS), gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and thin layer chromatography patterns of the rhizome extracts.", "A method (LC-MS analysis) has been developed on Agilent LC-MSD Trap SL mass spectrometer equipped with Waters HR C18 column (3.9 mm \u00d7 300 mm, 6 \u03bcm) using isocratic elution with acetonitrile and water (70:30% v/v ratio). GC-MS analysis was performed on a Shimadzu GC-MS-QP 2010 equipped with DB-5 capillary column (30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm).", "Chemoprofiling of CS and CR using LC-MS and GC-MS suggested that these two are different based on their deferential spectral pattern, however, some of the common peaks were found in both the species. In addition, we also performed the preliminary phytochemical investigation of hexane and chloroform extracts of these species, which led to the isolation of stigmasterol, \u03b2-sitosterol and lupeol as major constituents in CS.", "In summary, we have developed optimal chromatographic conditions (LC-MS and GC-MS) and morphological profiles to classify both the species, that is, CS and CR. Collectively, our analytical results coupled with the morphological data clearly suggested that CS and CR are morphologically different.", "The huge demand for herbal medicine has put pressure on the supply of natural resources which ultimately results in use of substandard materials or substitution and adulteration. The medicinal plants, Cyperus rotundus L and Cyperus scariosus R.Br which belongs to cyperaceae family and extensively used in the traditional systems of medicine. Although these two species are grown in different soil conditions, Cyperus scariosus R.Br often treated as synonymous of Cyperus rotundus. Thus, the present study was undertaken to classify these two species systematically using the modern analytical techniques as a powerful tools. Further, we also carried out the preliminary phytochemical investigation of hexane and chloroform extracts of cyperus scariosus rhizomes, which resulted in the isolation of three compounds namely Sitosterol, Stigmasterol and Lupeol."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Biomedical Research Laboratory, Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation University, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Kakarla", "ForeName": "Lavanya", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Natural Products Chemistry, Natural Products Laboratory, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad, Telangana, India."}], "LastName": "Katragadda", "ForeName": "Suresh Babu", "Initials": "SB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Biomedical Research Laboratory, Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation University, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Botlagunta", "ForeName": "Mahendran", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacogn Mag", "NlmUniqueID": "101300403", "ISSNLinking": "0973-1296"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Rajkumar V, Guha G, Kumar RA.
