The G-banding patterns of chromosomes were reproducible and chromosome-specific. Visual analysis allowed us to reveal from 5 to 10 G-positive bands and/or blocks of adjacent bands on individual chromosomes. In accordance with the G-banding patterns and morphology of chromosomes, all 9 homologous pairs were identified. The G-banding patterns of chromosomes in karyotypes of different Matricaria chamomilla L. cultivars were similar, thus indicating their species-specific character. The description of G-banding patterns of camomile chromosomes was given in accordance with the revealed G-band polymorphism, and the ideogram of M(ch) genome chromosomes was created. Image analysis of G-banding patterns of camomile chromosomes revealed up to 18 G-positive bands per chromosome with different staining intensity. As a result, the quantitative M(ch) genome ideogram reflecting structural peculiarities of chromosomes (band size, position, and staining intensity) was constructed. Comparison of the results of visual and image analyses of G-banding patterns of camomile chromosomes showed that they complemented each other. The first approach allowed us to determine the main peculiarities of G-banding patterns and the second one - to study the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the G-banded chromosome structure. Our results demonstrate the prospects of the G-like banding technique together with the image chromosome analysis in studying small-chromosome plant species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow. chrom@genome.eimb.rssi.ru"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Muravenko", "ForeName": "O V", "Initials": "OV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Samatadze", "ForeName": "T E", "Initials": "TE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zelenin", "ForeName": "A V", "Initials": "AV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Membr Cell Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9517472", "ISSNLinking": "1023-6597"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Chamomile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Banding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosomes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Karyotyping"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10512053"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
