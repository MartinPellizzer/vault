Plant leaves were extracted in 5% (w/v) perchloric acid and neutralized extracts were purified using C18 cartridges. The amino and organic acids in purified extracts were then converted to tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) derivatives prior to separation and detection by capillary gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detection. Conditions required for optimal derivatization were investigated. Amino and organic acids were readily converted to their TBDMS derivatives using N-methyl-N-tert-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide in dimethylformamide solvent 1:6 (v/v) with an average recovery of 90% and a reproducibility of about 5%. The characteristic [M-57] and [M-159] fragment ion of the TBDMS derivatives was confirmed using GC-MS. The proposed method was demonstrated by the determination of amino and organic acids in extracts of Acacia and Eucalyptus leaves, where detection limits were 1-20 ng."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 1998 Academic Press."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Western Australia, 6907, Australia. zchen@agric.uwa.edu.au"}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Landman", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Colmer", "ForeName": "T D", "Initials": "TD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Adams", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370535", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organosilicon Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "t-butyldimethylsilyl compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acacia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Eucalyptus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flame Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organosilicon Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9618198", "10.1006/abio.1998.2659", "S0003-2697(98)92659-8"]}}]}
