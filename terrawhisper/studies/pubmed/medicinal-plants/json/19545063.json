To study the properties of intestinal absorption in situ of SMESC, a series of studies were carried out including the absorption at different concentrations, at different intestinal regions and under different bile secretion conditions. The samples of the perfusion solution were collected at certain intervals. Ligustilide (LD) was chosen as marker component of VOC and the concentrations of which in the perfusion samples were determined by HPLC method. The results demonstrated that the absorption of LD in SMESC was the best and the absorption of VOC increased apparently (P < 0.001). The absorption of LD at concentration of 400 microg x mL(-1) was better than that at 200 microg x mL(-1) and 100 microg x mL(-1) (P < 0.001), while there was no significant difference between the absorption at concentrations of 200 microg x mL(-1) and 100 microg x mL(-1). The absorption of SMESC was not apparently influenced by bile secretion. SMESC could be absorbed in whole intestinal segments. The absorption rate constants (Ka) or apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) of SMESC showed duodenum > jejunum > colon = ileum. Ka and Papp of SMESC at duodenum were significantly higher than that at the other regions of intestine (P < 0.001)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Kelun Drug Development Co.
