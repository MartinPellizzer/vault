The chromatographic conditions were as follows:Welch SCX\uff084.6 mm\u00d7250 mm\uff0c 5 \u03bcm\uff09column, with acetonitrile-0.2% phosphoric acid solution (adjusted to pH 3.85-3.90 with ammonium hydroxide) at 50:50 as the mobile phase, at a flow rate of 0.5 mL\u00b7min\u207b\u00b9. The column temperature was set at 35 \u00b0C, and the detection wavelength was 215 nm. The results of content determination in 7 batches of AS and 10 batches of AP showed that, the contents of 4 alkaloids in AS (arecaidine 0.020%-0.045%, guvacine 0.031%-0.086%, arecoline 0.194%-0.346%, and guvacoline 0.065%-0.094%) were generally higher than those in AP (arecaidine 0.10%-0.032%, guvacine 0.006%-0.029% arecoline 0.00%-0.070%, and guvacoline 0.00%-0.020%), and most of the APs had no arecoline and arecaidine at all in fruit peel. The above results indicated that different alkaloids can be used to distinguish the different medicinal parts of Arera catechu. Arecoline\uff0c guvacoline\uff0c arecaidine\uff0c and guvacine can be used as the quality control markers of AS, while for AP, only arecaidine and guvacine were needed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine\uff0c Guangdong Pharmaceutical University\uff0c Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Quality Control Technology of Chinese Herbal Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences\uff0c Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Lian-Chao", "Initials": "LC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Taiji Group Chongqing Fuling Pharmaceuticals Co.\uff0c Ltd.\uff0c Chongqing 408000\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Shao-Rong", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Quality Control Technology of Chinese Herbal Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences\uff0c Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Yi", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Quality Control Technology of Chinese Herbal Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences\uff0c Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chun", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Quality Control Technology of Chinese Herbal Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences\uff0c Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Hui-Wen", "Initials": "HW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine\uff0c Guangdong Pharmaceutical University\uff0c Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Quality Control Technology of Chinese Herbal Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences\uff0c Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Cheng-Tao", "Initials": "CT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Quality Control Technology of Chinese Herbal Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences\uff0c Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Quality Control Technology of Chinese Herbal Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences\uff0c Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Qian", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Quality Control Technology of Chinese Herbal Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences\uff0c Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhi-Min", "Initials": "ZM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Semen"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30111041", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180514.009"]}}]}
