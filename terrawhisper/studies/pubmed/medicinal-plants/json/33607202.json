Ultrasonography was used to assess the status of uterine involution, fluid in uterus and ovarian follicular status. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of chemokine genes CXCR1, CXCR2 AND IL-8. Artificial insemination with cryopreserved semen was used to breed the animals. Reproductive efficiency parameters were assessed using standard calculation methods.", "Neutrophil functions and transcriptional abundance of chemokine genes were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) higher in buffaloes supplemented with polyherbal mixture compared to buffaloes in control group. The rate of cervical and uterine involution was significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) higher in treatment group compared to control group. The service period was shorter, days to first insemination was earlier and the number of services per conception was lower in buffaloes supplemented with polyherbal mixture compared to the buffaloes in control group. The proportion of buffaloes with large ovarian follicles within 28 days of post-partum was also significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) higher in treatment group compared to the control group.", "The polyherbal mixture used in the study improved the immunity of the buffaloes, facilitated early involution of cervix and uterus, efficient cleansing of lochia and improved subsequent fertility.
