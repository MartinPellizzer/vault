The pattern of dissipation of endosulfan was conventional showing half-life less than two days. The waiting periods worked out were 5 and 7 days after protecting the crop with four sprays of 0.03 and 0.08% endosulfan respectively. The dissipation of alpha isomer was found faster than that of beta isomer. Washing of fruits from treated crop was found quite effective in reducing the level of residues on the fruits."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pokharkar", "ForeName": "D S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dethe", "ForeName": "M D", "Initials": "MD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health B", "NlmUniqueID": "7607167", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OKA6A6ZD4K", "NameOfSubstance": "Endosulfan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Endosulfan"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Half-Life"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isomerism"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7288095", "10.1080/03601238109372270"]}}]}
