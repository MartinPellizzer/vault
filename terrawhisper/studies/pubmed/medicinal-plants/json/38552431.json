The rhizomes contain numerous active components, of which Gastrodin (p-hydroxymethylphenyl-B-D-glucopyranoside) forms the basis of the traditional medicine Gastrodiae Rhizoma. Gastrodin is also found in other medicinal plants and has neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. Neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in neurodegeneration. Research indicates that consuming meals and drinks containing Gastrodiaelata can enhance cognitive functioning and memory in elderly patients. The mechanisms relevant to the problem have not been completely understood.", "The aim was to examine the in vivo and in vitro anti-neuroinflammatory effects of Gastrodin.", "The neuroprotective effects of Gastrodin on the TLR4/TRAF6/NF-\u03baB pathway and Stat3 phosphorylation in LPS-treated C57BL/6 mice and BV-2 cells were investigated.", "1. C57BL/6 mice were assigned to model, gastrodin, donepezil, and control groups (n = 10 per group). The Gastrodin group received 100 mg/kg/d for five days, and the Dopenezil group 1.3 mg/kg/d. A neuroinflammation model was established by administering intraperitoneal injections of 2 mg/kg LPS to all groups, excluding the control. To induce microglial activation in Gastrodin-treated mouse microglial BV-2 cells, 1 \u00b5g/ml LPS was introduced for 24 h Morris water mazes were utilized to evaluate learning and spatial memory. Expression and subcellular localization of TLR4/TRAF6/NF-\u03baB axis-related proteins and p-Stat3, Iba-1, GFAP, iNOS, and CD206 were assessed by immunofluorescence, western blots, and ELISA. qRT-PCR was performed to determine and measure IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, cell migration, and phagocytosis. Overexpression of TRAF6 was induced by transfection, and the effect of Gastrodin on IL-1\u03b2 and p-NF-\u03baB p65 levels was assessed.", "1. In mice, gastrodin treatment mitigated LPS-induced deficits in learning and spatial memory, as well as reducing neuroinflammation in the hippocampus, expression of TLR4/TRAF6/NF-\u03baB pathway proteins, activation of microglia and astrocytes, and phosphorylation of Stat3. 2. Gastrodin pretreatment improved LPS-induced inflammation in vitro, reducing expression of TLR4/TRAF6/NF-\u03baB-associated proteins and p-Stat3, inducing microglial transformation from M1 to M2, and inhibiting migration and phagocytosis. Overexpression of TRAF6 inhibited the Gastrodin-induced effects.", "Gastrodin suppresses neuroinflammation and microglial activation by modifying the TLR4/TRAF6/NF-\u03baB pathway and Stat3 phosphorylation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
