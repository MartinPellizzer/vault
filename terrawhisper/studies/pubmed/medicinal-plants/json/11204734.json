In Nigher, its flowers and seeds are used for their hallucinogenic properties. Its alcalo\u00efds have an atropine-like effect. We are reporting here the first four cases of voluntary intoxication among teenagers in Niamey (Republic of Niger). The symptoms, which happened to be identical for the four patients, lead us quickly towards the possibility of a collective intoxication. During the questioning, the patients admitted they had smoked the plant's dried flowers, but also they drunk an herbal tea mixed with datura seeds. Symptoms are comparable to that of intoxications caused by atropine. Neurological signs are the main symptoms (agitation, delirium, disorientation, hallucination, mydriasis, retention of urine...). The others noticeable signs are: fever, dry mouth, tachycardia, thirstiness. The evolution was favourable as the patients left the hospital between D2 and D4. Those clinical features are compared to the literature items, which are inexistent in western Africa. The prognosis may be fatal, especially for the child and during massive intoxications meant to be autolystic or toxicomaniac. The recovery when possible leads usually to no sequels however sever the clinical picture is. The consultation of the population enabled us to comprehend that datura is known and consumed for its hallucinogenic proprieties. The therapeutic guidance is described and prevention suggested."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Service de m\u00e9decine interne, H\u00f4pital national de Niamey et D\u00e9partement de m\u00e9decine, Facult\u00e9 des sciences de la sant\u00e9, Niamey, Niger."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Djibo", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bouzou", "ForeName": "S B", "Initials": "SB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Intoxication aigu\u00eb au \"sobi-lobi\" (Datura).
