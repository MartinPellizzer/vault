Exploring novel sorbents with good selectivity for extraction and separation of medicinal compositions or active components from complex medicinal plants are interesting and challenging. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) show great potential in adsorption and extraction recently. Herein, we report our primary attempt of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) as a model MOF for selective extraction of a flavonoid named 3,4-dihydroxy-8,9-methylenedioxypterocarpan (compound 1) from a traditional medicinal plant Caragana Jubata. The enrichment factor of ZIF-8 for compound 1 is 57.7. The recoveries of compound 1 at three spiked levels (50, 100, 150\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup>) in Caragana Jubata dichloromethane extract are 62.1%, 66.4%, and 75.4%, respectively, with the relative standard deviations of less than 2.9%. The compound 1 also gave good linearity (R<sup>2</sup> of 0.999) in the concentration range of 5-1000\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup>. The obtained compound 1 gave highly antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging rate of 79.03%, inhibitory rate on lipid peroxidation of 75.30%, which were higher than the positive controls Vitamin C and BHT) and low IC<sub>50</sub> values (5.438\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.068, 20.970\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.083\u202f\u03bcg\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup> for DPPH radical scavenging activities and inhibitory effects on lipid peroxidation, respectively). These results demonstrated the feasibility of MOFs in selective extraction of medicinal compositions or active components from complex medicinal plants. The current work may open a new way of MOFs in selective extraction of pharmacological active components from medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
