B. falcatum is dominantly cultivated in Japan as well as planted in China,Korea and other countries and regions. In order to determine the appropriate sequencing strategy,the genome survey before large-scale genome sequencing is needed. This survey can provide information about the size and complexity of the whole genome of the target species. In the present study,the next generation sequencing technology( Illumina Hiseq 2000) was used to analyze the genome size and complexity of B. falcatum. In addition,SSR loci were analyzed from the sequenced data. Primer 3 was used to design specific primers and 33 pairs of primers were randomly selected for PCR with template DNA of B. falcatum,and the PCR system and optimal annealing temperature were screened. A total of 288. 64 G genome sequence data was obtained,and the estimated genome size of B. falcatum was 2 119. 58 Mb. The measured genome data depth was138\u00d7; the rate of heterozygosity was 1. 84%; and the ratio of repeat sequence was 83. 89%. It is speculated that the genome of B. falcatum is complex. The preliminary assembly was performed with K-mer = 41,and the contig N50 was 224 bp,the total length 896. 97 Mb,the scaffold N50 313 bp,and the total length was 922. 67 Mb. A total of 91 377 SSR sequences were detected in the sequenced genome data which were distributed in 70 809 unigenes.The main type is dinucleotide repeats,with 49 680 sequences,accounting for70. 16%. Among the 33 pairs of primers randomly synthesized according to the obtained SSR sequences,21 pairs were successfully amplifying the target sequences. The results will be helpful for later large scale genome sequencing and SSR molecular markers development for germplasm identification and trait mapping."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development ( IMPLAD) ,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College ( Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine,Ministry of Education & National Engineering Laboratory for Breeding of Endangered Medicinal Materials) Beijing 100193,China Jiamusi University Jiamusi 154007,China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Chu-Ran", "Initials": "CR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development ( IMPLAD) ,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College ( Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine,Ministry of Education & National Engineering Laboratory for Breeding of Endangered Medicinal Materials) Beijing 100193,China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jiao", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development ( IMPLAD) ,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College ( Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine,Ministry of Education & National Engineering Laboratory for Breeding of Endangered Medicinal Materials) Beijing 100193,China Jiamusi University Jiamusi 154007,China."}], "LastName": "DU", "ForeName": "Ming-Li", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiamusi University Jiamusi 154007,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Li-Hong", "Initials": "LH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development ( IMPLAD) ,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College ( Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine,Ministry of Education & National Engineering Laboratory for Breeding of Endangered Medicinal Materials) Beijing 100193,China."}], "LastName": "Sui", "ForeName": "Chun", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development ( IMPLAD) ,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College ( Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine,Ministry of Education & National Engineering Laboratory for Breeding of Endangered Medicinal Materials) Beijing 100193,China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Jian-He", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bupleurum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microsatellite Repeats"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31872731", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190730.103"]}}]}
