Compared to a single symptom, syndrome can demonstrate the nature of a disease more extensively, completely and correctly. However, it is difficult to compare \"Zheng\" to the western medicine theory, which is based on scientific evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of a specific disease. Estrogen deficiency is a major pathogenetic factor in bone loss after menopause and oophorectomy with the subsequent risk of developing osteoporosis. According to TCM theory, the kidney stores essence and this can transform into bone marrow to nourish the bones, strenghthen the skeleton by promoting growth and repair. The kidney deficiency can decrease the estrogen level adjusted by the gonadal axis, causing osteoporosis. Traditional Chinese medicines tonifying the kidney can significantly enhance the level of estrogen to alleviate osteoporosis. In combination with other evidence, we further deduce that the syndrome as defined within TCM has a similar pathological mechanism to that defined by western medicine. If TCM theory is to be understood and accepted, and further fused with the western medicine theory, the micro pathological basis of TCM syndrome must be investigated extensively, which will lead to bridging the two theories together. The fusion of TCM with western medicine will pay more attention to analyzing the common nature and difference of disease and syndrome.
