In the last years, research has focused on E. maritimum, with previous studies reporting anticancer, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. Ethnobotanical literature suggests that it has been traditionally used to treat a wide range of illnesses, having antitussive, diuretic and aphrodisiac properties. Being rhizome one of the most bioactive organs, much of the available references from traditional uses suggest that it has been specifically used to treat renal diseases. In this sense, inflammation and oxidative processes play a major role in kidney dysfunctions, which could be associated to the mechanism of action of the plant extracts.", "The main aim of the study was to investigate the effects of E. maritimum rhizome extract on the antioxidant and inflammatory response in human immune cells.", "Rhizome extracts were obtained from plants growing in Mallorca (Balearic Islands), and its composition was determined using HPLC-DAD, highlighting simple phenolic compounds such as trans-ferulic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, epicatechin and rosmarinic acid as the major constituents. Total antioxidant capacity was determined using the FRAP assay. Jurkat cells were cultured to analyse cytotoxicity by cell viability assay. In parallel, cells were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and treated with different extract concentrations. Gene and protein expression, as well as nitrite and cytokine levels were evaluated as indicators of metabolic responses.", "The plant extract showed a high diversity of pharmacologically bioactive compounds with potential therapeutic uses. The extract presented null cytotoxicity and exerted antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on Jurkat cells by inducing an antioxidant response and reducing cytokine and nitric oxide release and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes.", "The present findings suggest that E. maritimum is a promising phytotherapeutic species because of its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential, which could explain some of its traditional uses."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
