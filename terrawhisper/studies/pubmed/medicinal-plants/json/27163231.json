Because the ethanol extracts of the bark and the isolated terpenes of these plants have shown promising in vivo antidiabetic effects, an analytical method was developed and validated by RP-HPLC-ELSD for the identification and quantification of eight lupane- and ursane-type terpenes. The extraction method reproducibly recovered the compounds above 70\u200a% and the chromatographic separation of betulin, 23-hydroxy-betulin, 23,28-dihydroxylupan-20(29)-ene-3\u03b2-caffeate, betulinic acid, \u03b1-amyrin, uvaol, 3\u03b2,23,28-trihydroxy-12-ursene, and 23,28-dihydroxyursan-12-ene-3\u03b2-caffeate was achieved within 27\u2009min by linear gradient. The method produced highly reproducible quantitative data at interday and intraday levels. The limits of detection were in the ng level on-column with remarkable range and linearity. The target compounds were present at mg levels in the populations, collected from inland (Mistissini and Nemaska) and costal (Waskagnish and Chisasibi) Cree communities of northern Quebec. A triterpene, 23-hydroxybetulin, was the most abundant, while betulinic acid and uvaol were minor constituents. Overall, HPLC-ELSD analyses produced very similar profiles and contents of the eight compounds in the plants collected from four geographic locations. The developed HPLC-ELSD method can be used as a targeted analysis of triterpenes in these medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for the Analysis of Natural and Synthetic Environmental Toxins, Department of Biology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}], "LastName": "Saleem", "ForeName": "Ammar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for the Analysis of Natural and Synthetic Environmental Toxins, Department of Biology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CIHR Team in Aboriginal Antidiabetic Medicines, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada."}], "LastName": "Guerrero-Analco", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CIHR Team in Aboriginal Antidiabetic Medicines, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada."}], "LastName": "Bailie", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CIHR Team in Aboriginal Antidiabetic Medicines, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada."}], "LastName": "Foster", "ForeName": "Brian", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CIHR Team in Aboriginal Antidiabetic Medicines, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada."}], "LastName": "Cuerrier", "ForeName": "Alain", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CIHR Team in Aboriginal Antidiabetic Medicines, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada."}], "LastName": "Johns", "ForeName": "Timothy", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CIHR Team in Aboriginal Antidiabetic Medicines, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada."}], "LastName": "Haddad", "ForeName": "Pierre S", "Initials": "PS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for the Analysis of Natural and Synthetic Environmental Toxins, Department of Biology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}], "LastName": "Arnason", "ForeName": "John Thor", "Initials": "JT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Validation Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Canada"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indians, North American"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Bark"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Scattering, Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sorbus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27163231", "10.1055/s-0042-105444"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
