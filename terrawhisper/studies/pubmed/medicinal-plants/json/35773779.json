Globally, COVID-19 has created a health disaster and adversely affects the economic growth. Although some vaccines have already emerged, no therapeutic medication has yet been approved by FDA for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Traditionally, we have been using different medicinal plants like neem, tulsi, tea, and many spices like garlic, ginger, turmeric, black seed, onion, etc. for the treatment of flu-like diseases. In this paper, we are highlighting the recent research progress in the identification of natural products from the Indian medicinal plants and spices that have potential inhibition properties against SARS-CoV-2. This study will provide an initiative to stimulate further research by providing useful guidance to the medicinal chemists for designing new protease inhibitors effective against SARS-CoV-2 in future.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
