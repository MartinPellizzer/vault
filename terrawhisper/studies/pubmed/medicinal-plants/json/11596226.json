The analytical column used was ZY110 YNG-C18. The mobile phase was KH2PO4(0.01 mol.L-1)--MeOH(73:27), pH2.5, regulated by 10% H3PO4. Flow rate was 1.0 ml.min-1. The detection wavelength was 264 nm. The linear ranges of strychmine and brucine were 0.18-7.26 micrograms and 0.11-4.32 micrograms, respectively. The recoveries of strychnine and brucine were 98.27% and 98.04%, respectively. The analytical results showed that the contents of strychnine and brucine in samples showed great difference between different species. The contents of strychnine in the seeds of Strychnos wallichiana and S. ignatii were 5.6% and 3.9%, respectively. These results show that the two Strychnos species may be developed as the resources of strychnine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100094."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Z P", "Initials": "ZP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lian", "ForeName": "W Y", "Initials": "WY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "P G", "Initials": "PG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6NG17YCK6H", "NameOfSubstance": "brucine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H9Y79VD43J", "NameOfSubstance": "Strychnine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Strychnine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11596226"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
