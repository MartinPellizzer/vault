Ginsenoside Rh2 was employed as an internal standard. Dioscin is a naturally occurring saponin present in many traditional Chinese medicinal plants. Dioscin was determined after the acetonitrile-mediated plasma protein precipitation. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile:10 mmol/l aqueous ammonium acetate (95:5, v:v), which was pumped at 0.8 ml/min. The analytical column (100 mm x 4.6 mm i.d.) was packed with Hypersil ODS material (5 microm). The standard curve was linear from 1 to 100 ng/ml. The assay was specific, accurate (percentage deviations from nominal concentrations were <10%), precise and reproducible (within- and between-day coefficients of variation <10%). Dioscin in rat plasma was stable over three freeze-thaw cycles and at ambient temperatures for 24 h. The utility of the assay was demonstrated by determining dioscin plasma concentrations in five rats for 120 h following a single oral gavage dose of 90 mg/kg."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Wenhua Road 103, Shenyang 110016, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yingwu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Jingkai", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xiaoyan", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Dafang", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Validation Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101139554", "ISSNLinking": "1570-0232"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3B95U4OLWV", "NameOfSubstance": "dioscin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K49P2K8WLX", "NameOfSubstance": "Diosgenin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "blood", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Diosgenin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15686995", "10.1016/j.jchromb.2004.12.026", "S1570-0232(05)00007-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
