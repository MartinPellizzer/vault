The structures of compounds were identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry, ~1H-NMR, ~(13)C-NMR, HMQC, HMBC, and ~1H-~1H COSY, as well as physicochemical properties of compounds and literature data. Twelve compounds were isolated from 30% ethanol fraction of the seeds of M. oleifera and identified as ethyl-4-O-\u03b1-L-rhamnosyl-\u03b1-L-rhamnoside(1), ethyl-3-O-\u03b1-L-rhamnosyl-\u03b1-L-rhamnoside(2),(4-hydroxybenzyl)ethyl carbamate(3),(4-aminophenyl)acetic acid(4), ethyl-\u03b1-L-rhamnoside(5), methyl-\u03b1-L-rhamnoside(6), moringapyranosyl(7), 2-[4-(\u03b1-L-rhamnosyl)phenyl]methyl acetate(8), niaziridin(9), 5-hydroxymethyl furfural(10), 4-hydroxybenzeneacetamide(11), and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid(12). Among them, compounds 1 and 2 are two new compounds, compound 3 is a new natural product, and compounds 4-5 were yielded from Moringa plant for the first time. All compounds were evaluated for \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity in vitro. Compound 10 showed excellent inhibitory activity with IC_(50) of 210 \u03bcg\u00b7mL~(-1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025, China Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education),Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025, China Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education),Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Cen", "ForeName": "Yin-Zhi", "Initials": "YZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025, China Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education),Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Tu", "ForeName": "Yang-Li", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025, China Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education),Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Xiang-Jie", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education),Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yong-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Sheng", "Initials": "XS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025, China Key Laboratory of Basic Pharmacology of Ministry of Education, Zunyi Medical University Zunyi 563000, China Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education),Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Lin-Zhen", "Initials": "LZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.20", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Glucosidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Moringa oleifera"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Glucosidases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Moringa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37802807", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20230517.201"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
