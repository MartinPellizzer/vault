Here, we review how hormones and environmental factors promote the accumulation of active ingredients, thereby providing a strategy to produce high-value drugs at a low cost. Focusing on major hormone signaling events and environmental factors, we review the transcriptional regulatory network mediating biosynthesis of representative active ingredients. In this network, many transcription factors (TFs) simultaneously control multiple synthase genes; thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms affecting transcriptional regulation of active ingredients will be crucial to developing new breeding possibilities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
