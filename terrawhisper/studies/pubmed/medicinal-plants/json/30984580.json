Nervous diseases are rising all around the world. This paper provides important ethnobotanical information on plants that are used against neurological disorders and are available in medicinal markets of Bojnord, northeastern Iran.", "This survey, as an ethnobotanical study, was carried out between 2017 and 2018. The identification of the intended plant species was done using the available Floras. Some important indices such as the frequency of citations, relative frequency of citation (RFC), family importance value and use report were calculated for the medicinal plants included in the present study.", "The present study includes 58 medicinal plant species belonging to 36 families and reports their mentioning scientific and vernacular names, parts used, and preparation method. The most common family was Lamiaceae. The major parts of the identified plants used for treatment of nervous )neuropsychological( disorders were flower and aerial parts. The most common methods used for preparation of these plants were infusion and decoction. <i>Stachys</i> <i>turcomanica</i>, <i>Tripleurospermum</i> <i>disciforme</i>, <i>Melissa officinalis</i>, <i>Nardostachys jatamansi</i>, and <i>Aloysia</i>\u00a0<i>citriodora</i> had the highest rate of use report. <i>Echium</i> <i>amoenum</i> and <i>Melissa officinalis</i> had the highest RFC.", "The study indicated that although people in Bojnord have access to modern medicinal preparations, a considerable number of them still use medicinal plants for therapeutic purposes. Seemingly, most cited plants are worth more precise evaluations for their pharmacological activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Payame Noor University (PNU), Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nadaf", "ForeName": "Mohabat", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Research Center for Plant Sciences, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Joharchi", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Payame Noor University (PNU), Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amiri", "ForeName": "Mohammad Sadegh", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Avicenna J Phytomed", "NlmUniqueID": "101586220", "ISSNLinking": "2228-7930"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have no conflict of interest to declare."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Akhondzadeh S, Maleki J.
