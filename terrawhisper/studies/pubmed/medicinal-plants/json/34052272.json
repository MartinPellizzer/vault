Red cabbage extract (RCE), consisting of bioactive compounds that have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, bactericidal, antifungal, and antiviral activities, was utilized as a natural pH-sensitive indicator. Chitosan-based hydrogel, encapsulating RCE, was developed to obtain a smart therapeutic pH-sensitive wound dressing as antimicrobial bio-matrix provides a comfortable cushion for wound bed and indicates its status. Methacrylated-chitosan was crosslinked by different concentrations of methylenebisacrylamide (MBAA) by which hydrogel mechanical and morphological properties were tuned. The proposed mechanism for hydrogel formation was confirmed by FT-IR. The coloristic properties of the RCE and the changes in color intensity as a function of pH were confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The effect of MBAA on the mechanical, swelling, release and morphological properties of hydrogel were investigated. MBAA (2.5% wt/v) in 2% wt/v chitosan showed preferable mechanical (20 KPa), swelling (1294% at pH 8 \u00b1 0.2), and release (prolonged up to 5 days) properties. Hydrogel matrices, loaded on cotton gauze submerged in different pH buffer solutions, showed explicit color changes from green to red as pH changed from 9 to 4."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
