The resulting antibodies reacted specifically with meGTP but not with GTP, GDP, GMP, meGMP, meATP, meCTP, meUTP, or with methyl phosphate in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and/or in radioimmunoassays. Although less efficiently, meGDP was also recognized by these antibodies. Indirect immunofluorescence studies with anti-meGTP antibodies showed predominantly nuclear immunofluorescence. Anti-meGTP antibodies immunoprecipitated intact U6 snRNA from a mixture of HeLa cell RNAs. In addition to the U6 snRNA, anti-meGTP antibodies immunoprecipitated several additional small RNAs that varied in length from approximately 50 to 330 nucleotides. These RNAs contained the meGTP cap structure and are structurally distinct from U6 snRNA. One of these meGTP-containing RNAs was found to be previously characterized 7SK RNA; human 7SK RNA synthesized in vitro also contained the same cap structure. Results obtained in this study provide evidence for the presence of gamma-monomethyl-GTP cap structure in a wide spectrum of human cellular RNAs. These antibodies will be useful in studying the structure and function of this new family of small RNAs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Busch", "ForeName": "R K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Reddy", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM-38320", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA Caps"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Small Nuclear"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "gamma-monomethylGTP"}, {"RegistryNumber": "86-01-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Guanosine Triphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "UT0S826Z60", "NameOfSubstance": "Uridine Triphosphate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescent Antibody Technique"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Guanosine Triphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "RNA Caps"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Small Nuclear"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Uridine Triphosphate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2229067", "S0021-9258(17)30635-X"]}}]}
