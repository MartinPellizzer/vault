In this study, the sub-stomatal apoplastic activities of K+, Cl-, Ca2+ and H+ were continuously monitored by inserting ion-selective micro-electrodes through the open stomata of intact Vicia faba leaves. In light-adapted leaves, the mean activities were 2.59 mM (K+), 1.26 mM (Cl-), 64 microM (Ca2+) and 89 microM (H+). Stomatal closure was investigated through exposure to abscisic acid (ABA), sudden darkness or both. Feeding the leaves with ABA through the cut petiole initially resulted in peaks after 9-10 min, in which Ca2+ and H+ activities transiently decreased, and Cl- and K+ activities transiently increased. Thereafter, Ca2+, H+ and Cl- activities completely recovered, while K+ activity approached an elevated level of around 10 mM within 20 min. Similar responses were observed following sudden darkness, with the difference that Cl- and Ca2+ activities recovered more slowly. Addition of ABA to dark-adapted leaves evoked responses of Cl- and Ca2+ similar to those observed in the light. K+ activity, starting from its elevated level, responded to ABA with a transient increase peaking around 16 mM, but then returned to its dark level. During stomatal closure, membrane potential changes in mesophyll cells showed no correlation with the K+ kinetics in the sub-stomatal cavity. We thus conclude that the increase in K+ activity mainly resulted from K+ release by the guard cells, indicating apoplastic compartmentation. Based on the close correlation between Cl- and Ca2+ changes, we suggest that anion channels are activated by a rise in cytosolic free Ca2+, a process which activates depolarization-activated K+ release channels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botanisches Institut I, Universit\u00e4t Giessen, Senckenbergstrasse 17, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.
