The blood flow volume (BFV) of the left coronary artery and cardiac output (CO), left ventricular pressure (LVP), maximum ascending rate (dp/dtmax) of LVP, mean arterial pressure (MAP) of the femoral artery, oxygen contents of the coronary artery and coronary vein (venous sinus), oxygen consumption index (OCI), cardiac index (CI), coronary artery resistance (CAR) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) as well as oxygen utilization rate (OUR) were detected respectively.", "After venous injection of Gadol, CAR, MAP, TPR, OCI, myocardial oxygen consumption and heart rate lowered significantly (P < 0.05-0.01), while BFV and blood oxygen content of the venous sinus increased considerably (P < 0.05-0.01) in comparison with pre-injection. No significant differences were found in LVP and myocardial contractivity between control group and LDG, and between control and HDG groups respectively.", "It showed dilation of the coronary artery and reduction of the cardiac afterload after injection of Gadol. Besides, CO and stroke volume increased considerably and the cardiac effective work was raised without any significant simultaneous increase of both myocardial contractility and LVP. A decrease in the myocardial oxygen consumption and reduction of OCI indicates an improvement of the oxygen supply of the myocardium, and a favorable regulation of the compliance of the cardiac vessels. As a result, the cardiovascular performance was ameliorated. The abovementioned improvement of these indexes may contribute to the therapeutic effect of Gadol in the treatment of coronary heart disease in clinic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine information, China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100700, China. zhangzaohuays@sohu.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zao-hua", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jian-sun", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Ji-nong", "Initials": "JN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Xiao-hong", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Cheng-ren", "Initials": "CR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xiao-bin", "Initials": "XB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Ti-ren", "Initials": "TR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yang-hui", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yan-rong", "Initials": "YR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jing-hua", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Xiao-yang", "Initials": "XY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-dan", "Initials": "XD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "De-shan", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Zhi-hui", "Initials": "ZH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiac Output"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemodynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhodiola"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Resistance"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16161429"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
