This study aims to elucidate the effects of long non-coding RNA LINC01260 (LINC01260) on the proliferation, migration and invasion of spinal cord glioma cells by targeting Caspase recruitment domain family, member 11 (CARD11) via nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling.", "The Multi Experiment Matrix (MEM) website was used for target gene prediction, and the DAVID database was used for analysis of the relationship between CARD11 and the NF-\u03baB pathway. In total, 60 cases of glioma tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected. Human U251 glioma cells were grouped into blank, negative control (NC), LINC01260 vector, CARD11 vector, siRNA-LINC01260, siRNA-CARD11, LINC01260 vector + CARD11 vector and LINC01260 + siRNA-CARD11 groups. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was conducted to verify the target relationship between LINC01260 and CARD11. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis were employed to assess expression of LINC01260, E-cadherin, p53, CARD11, Ki67, N-cadherin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, NF-\u03baBp65 and NF-\u03baBp50. MTT, flow cytometry, wound-healing and Transwell assays were performed to examine cell viability, the cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion and migration. Tumor growth was assessed through xenografts in nude mice.", "CARD11 was confirmed to be a target gene of LINC01260 and was found to be involved in regulating the NF-\u03baB pathway. Compared with adjacent normal tissues, glioma tissues showed reduced expression of LINC01260 and elevated expression of CARD11 and genes related to apoptosis, invasion and migration; activation of NF-\u03baB signaling was also observed. In contrast to the blank and NC groups, an elevated number of cells arrested in G1 phase, increased apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation, invasion and number of cells arrested in S and G2 phases, as well as tumor growth were found for the LINC01260 vector and siRNA-CARD11 groups.", "Our findings demonstrate that overexpression of LINC01260 inhibits spinal cord glioma cell proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting CARD11 via NF-\u03baB signaling suppression."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 The Author(s).
