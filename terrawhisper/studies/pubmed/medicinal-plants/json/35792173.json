Recently, we have reported novel fluorophenyl benzimidazole (FPD) for vasorelaxation and antihypertensive activity in SHRs. The present study envisaged the anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and cardio-protective properties of FPD in L-NAME model of hypertension with special emphasis on reversal of vascular remodeling, gene expression and restoration of hemodynamic.", "Antihypertensive activity of FPD was evaluated in L-NAME treated Wistar rats, and the parameters studied were anti-inflammatory activity, histomorphological changes, gene expression profile and anti-oxidant properties.", "FPD at 50 and 100\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> once daily for 15 days significantly reduced SBP, DBP and MAP in L-NAME treated rats and the values were well comparable to vehicle control group. Further, FPD treatment showed a significant increase in hepatic GSH content, SOD, catalase activity, decreased MDA level and restoration of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels. The mRNA expression profile of genes associated with regulation of vascular tone, remodeling and inflammation showed a significant level of alteration by chronic L-NAME treatment and was dose-dependently restored upon treatment with FPD. Further, FPD treatment restored serum lipid profile, CK, CK-MB and LDH level and also reversed the histomorphological changes like intimal wall thickening, hyperplasia of cardiomyocytes and ventricular wall thickening.", "Taken together, FPD produced potent antihypertensive activity in L-NAME model through vasorelaxation, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties leading to restoration of serum lipid profile, cardiac biomarker, expression profile of target genes and reversal of histomorphological changes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
