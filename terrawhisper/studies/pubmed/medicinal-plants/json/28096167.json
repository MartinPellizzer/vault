The correlation between the formula and its raw herbs was also evaluated. According to the retention time of standard components, chemical fingerprint of DCHG was developed and a total of 21 constituents were characterized. The separation was performed on a Kromasil C18 column (250 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm i.d. with 5.0 \u03bcm particle size) with a linear gradient elution of acetonitrile and water with 0.05% phosphoric acid. Precision, stability and repeatability of the method were validated. The developed method was subsequently applied to evaluate 15 batches of DCHG using similarity analysis, principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminate analysis."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author 2017.
