PTU was given in drinking water (0.05%) during 6 weeks. Pioglitazone (10 or 20\u2009mg/kg) was daily injected intraperitoneally. Passive avoidance (PA) and Morris water maze (MMW) were conducted. Later, the animals were sacrificed and the brain tissues were removed for biochemical measurements. <b>Key funding</b>: The results indicated that in the MWM escape latency as well as traveled path increased in the PTU group as compared to the control group. Also, the time spent in the target quadrant in the probe test of MWM and step-through latency in the PA test were decreased in the PTU group as compared to the control group. Pioglitazone reversed all the negative behavioral effects of hypothyroidism. Administration of PTU attenuated thiol and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities in the brain tissues, whereas increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) metabolites. PPAR\u03b3 agonist improved thiol, SOD and CAT, while diminished MDA concentration. <b>Significance</b>: Our finding in the present study indicated that PPAR\u03b3 agonist pioglitazone prevented the brain tissues from oxidative damage and learning and memory impairments in juvenile hypothyroid rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Baghcheghi", "ForeName": "Yousef", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Salmani", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Basic Sciences and Neuroscience Research Center, Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences , Torbat Heydariyeh , Iran."}], "LastName": "Beheshti", "ForeName": "Farimah", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Shafei", "ForeName": "Mohammad Naser", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghnia", "ForeName": "Hamid Reza", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Soukhtanloo", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Ebrahimzadeh Bideskan", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Neurosci", "NlmUniqueID": "0270707", "ISSNLinking": "0020-7454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "PPAR gamma"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X4OV71U42S", "NameOfSubstance": "Pioglitazone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Injuries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hypothyroidism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Maze Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Memory Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["agonists"], "DescriptorName": "PPAR gamma"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Pioglitazone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31215278", "10.1080/00207454.2019.1632843"]}}]}
