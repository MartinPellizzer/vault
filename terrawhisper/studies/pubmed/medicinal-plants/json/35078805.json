The furan ring present in the chemical structures may be one of the domineering factors to bring about the toxic response resulting from the generation of reactive epoxide or <i>cis</i>-enedial intermediates, which have the potential to react with biomacromolecules. This review sets out to explore the relationship between the metabolic activation and hepatotoxicity of furan-containing compounds on the strength of scientific reports on several typical alkylated furans, synthetic pharmaceuticals, and components extracted from herbal medicines. The pharmacological activities as well as concrete evidence of their liver injuries are described, and the potential toxic mechanisms were discussed partly based on our previous work. Efforts were made to understand the development of liver injury and seek solutions to prevent adverse effects. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This review mainly elucidates the vital role of metabolic activation in the hepatotoxicity of furan-containing compounds through several typical chemicals studied. The possible mechanisms involved in the toxicities are discussed based on collective literatures as well as our work. Additionally, the structural features responsible for toxicities are elaborated to predict toxicity potentials of furan-containing compounds. This article may assist to seek solutions for the occurring problems and prevent the toxic effects of compounds with furan(s) in clinical practice."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China (M.T., Y.P., J.Z.) and State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics of Guizhou Province (J.Z.) and Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution, Monitoring and Disease Control, Ministry of Education (J.Z.), Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China (M.T., Y.P., J.Z.) and State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics of Guizhou Province (J.Z.) and Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution, Monitoring and Disease Control, Ministry of Education (J.Z.), Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China (M.T., Y.P., J.Z.) and State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics of Guizhou Province (J.Z.) and Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution, Monitoring and Disease Control, Ministry of Education (J.Z.), Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China zhengneu@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Jiang", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Metab Dispos", "NlmUniqueID": "9421550", "ISSNLinking": "0090-9556"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Furans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "UC0XV6A8N9", "NameOfSubstance": "furan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Activation, Metabolic"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Furans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "28"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35078805", "10.1124/dmd.121.000458", "dmd.121.000458"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
