The underground parts of the plants are used in traditional medicine to manage epilepsy and other cardiovascular conditions.", "The present study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of a characterized hydroalcoholic extract (NJET) of Nardostachys jatamansi in the lithium-pilocarpine rat model of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and associated cardiac irregularities.", "NJET was prepared by percolation using 80% ethanol. The dried NEJT was subjected to UHPLC-qTOF-MS/MS for chemical characterization. Molecular docking studies were performed using the characterized compounds to understand mTOR interactions. The animals showing SRS following lithium-pilocarpine administration were treated with NJET for 6 weeks. Afterward, seizure severity, cardiac parameters, serum biochemistry, and histopathological parameters were studied. The cardiac tissue was processed for specific protein and gene expression studies.", "The UHPLC-qTOF-MS/MS characterized 13 compounds in NJET. The identified compounds subjected to molecular docking showed promising binding affinities toward mTOR. There was a dose-dependent decrease in the severity of SRS following the extract administration. A reduction in mean arterial pressure and serum biochemical markers (lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase) was also observed following NJET treatment in epileptic animals. Histopathological investigations revealed reduced degenerative changes and decreased fibrosis following the extract treatment. The cardiac mRNA level of Mtor, Rps6, Hif1a, and Tgfb3 was reduced in the extract-treated groups. Further, a similar reduction in the protein expression of p-mTOR and HIF-1\u03b1 was also observed following NJET treatment in the cardiac tissue.", "The results concluded that NJET treatment reduces lithium-pilocarpine-induced recurrent seizures and associated cardiac irregularities via downregulation of the mTOR signalling pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
