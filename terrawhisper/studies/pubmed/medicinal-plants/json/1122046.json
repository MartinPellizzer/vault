The results are indeed depressing. In spite of close follow-up and systematic treatment with modern antihypertensive agents, the mortality of patients having hypertension with superimposed arteriosclerosis was 27% (15 to 56) for males as contrasted to 3% (2 of 75) for females. Since the last casual blood pressure in both living and deceased patients of the mixed group were similar, the level of blood pressure following treatment could not be incriminated for the deceased patients. An exaggerated systolic and pulse pressure cold pressor response emerged as an important indicator of presence of arteriosclerosis alone. When hypertension and arteriosclerosis coexisted there was also exaggeration in diastolic cold pressor response. A further exaggeration in systolic and diastolic cold pressor response was seen in the decreased as compared to living male patients, a finding which appears to have grave prognostic significance for coronary heart disease and stroke. Thus a marked exaggeration in both systolic and diastolic cold pressor response in males might prove to be the single most important predictor of premature death from atherosclerotic vascular disease. A further analysis of the deceased male patients having hypertension and superimposed arteriosclerosis, indicates that treatment of hypertension may prevent oeath from stroke but not form coronary heart disease. Two-thirds of the deaths occur suddenly and only one-third of the deceased patients reached the hospital befor dying. In view of these distressing findings a plea for early detection and treatment of hypertension, prior to the development of superimposed arteriosclerotic changes, particularly in males, is made."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Voudoukis", "ForeName": "I J", "Initials": "IJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Angiology", "NlmUniqueID": "0203706", "ISSNLinking": "0003-3197"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "26NAK24LS8", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydralazine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27O7W4T232", "NameOfSubstance": "Spironolactone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8B1QWR724A", "NameOfSubstance": "Reserpine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Arteriosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cold Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hydralazine"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Private Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prognosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Reserpine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Spironolactone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Statistics as Topic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1975", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1975", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1975", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1122046", "10.1177/000331977502600106"]}}]}
