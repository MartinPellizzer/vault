In normal rabbits, oral administration of aqueous extract (300 mg/kg) produced significant reduction in plasma glucose after 1 h and highly significant after 2,3 and 6 h. Phytochemical screening revealed that the rind of C. colocynthis and its aqueous extract contains tertiary and quaternary alkaloids, glycoside and saponin components. The hypoglycaemic effects of these components given orally at a dose (50 mg/kg) were studied in normoglycaemic rabbits. Result showed that the alkaloidal extract did not significantly lower the blood glucose levels from 132 mg/100 ml at 0 h to 120 mg/100 ml after 6 h, while the glycosidic extract significantly lowered the fasting glucose levels after 2 and 3 h and highly significant after 6 h. The effect was more pronounced with saponin extract, the saponin significantly lowered the fasting glucose levels after 1 and 2 h and highly significant (P<0.001) after 3 and 6 h. Graded doses (10, 15 and 20 mg/kg) of saponin extract, when given orally to alloxan diabetic rabbits, produced a significant reduction of plasma glucose concentration. These results suggest that the aqueous extract of the rind of C. colocynthis possesses a hypoglycaemic effect and its hypoglycaemic action could be attributed for more extent to the presence of saponin in addition to the presence of glycosidic components."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, College of Science, University of Basrah, Basrah, Iraq."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abdel-Hassan", "ForeName": "I A", "Initials": "IA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abdel-Barry", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tariq Mohammeda", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iraq"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10904181", "10.1016/s0378-8741(99)00215-9", "S0378-8741(99)00215-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
