In the present work, highly sensitive MIP sensor was developed and successfully applied for rutin recognition. The MIP was decorated on the surface of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite modified with glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to fabricate GCE/rGO/ZIF-8/MIP electrode. Spectroscopic and microscopic analyses such as XRD, FT-IR, BET and SEM were used to evaluate the composition and the morphology of the surface of GCE/rGO/ZIF-8/MIP electrode. The electrochemical characterization of electrodes was performed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Also different parameters influencing the sensitivity of GCE/rGO/ZIF-8/MIP, such as the percentage of rGO, template:monomer ratio, number of electropolymerization cycles, accumulation time and pH were optimized. Under optimal conditions, the MIP sensor shows a wide linear range and low limit of detection as well as good reproducibility, stability and selectivity, and used successfully for the determination of rutin in real solutions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
