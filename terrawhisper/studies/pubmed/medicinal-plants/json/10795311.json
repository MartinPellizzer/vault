A 30 s green light pulse eliminated the transient opening stimulated by an immediately preceding blue light pulse. Opening was restored by a subsequent blue light pulse. An initial green light pulse did not alter the response to a subsequent blue light pulse. Reversal also occurred under continuous illumination, with or without a saturating red light background. The magnitude of the green light reversal depended on fluence rate, with full reversal observed at a green light fluence rate twice that of the blue light. Continuous green light given alone stimulated a slight stomatal opening, and had no effect on red light-stimulated opening. An action spectrum for the green light effect showed a maximum at 540 nm and minor peaks at 490 and 580 nm. This spectrum is similar to the action spectrum for blue light-stimulated stomatal opening, red-shifted by about 90 nm. The carotenoid zeaxanthin has been implicated as a photoreceptor for the stomatal blue light response. Blue/green reversibility might be explained by a pair of interconvertible zeaxanthin isomers, one absorbing in the blue and the other in the green, with the green absorbing form being the physiologically active one."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Organismic Biology, Ecology and Evolution, University of California, Los Angeles 90024, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frechilla", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Talbott", "ForeName": "L D", "Initials": "LD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bogomolni", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zeiger", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9430925", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0781"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10795311", "10.1093/pcp/41.2.171"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
