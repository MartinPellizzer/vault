Recent developments in disease treatment have introduced the concept of host-directed therapy (HDT). This approach involves targeting factors within the host cell that can impede the growth or replication of a pathogen. One such host factor is delta aminolevulinate dehydratase (\u03b4-ALAD), the second enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway utilized by Plasmodium for growth. Studies using mice models have shown an increase in \u03b4-ALAD expression during Plasmodium berghei infection. Another plant in the Solanum genus, S. guaranticum, has been found to inhibit \u03b4-ALAD in red blood cells in vitro and in the brain in vivo. Is it possible that the bioactive compounds in S. incanum extracts could also be effective in HDT for malaria treatment?", "To better assess the effectiveness of S. incanum leaf extracts as a curative and prophylaxis in malaria parasite infection, and to test the plant's ability to decrease \u03b4-ALAD expression.", "The leaves of S. incanum were collected, dried, and pulverized before being subjected to a successive extraction protocol to obtain crude, hexane, ethyl acetate, and aqueous extract fractions. Phytochemical analysis was conducted on all extract fractions, followed by GC-MS analysis of the fraction with the most potent antimalarial activity. An acute toxicity study was also performed on the extracted fractions. The potency of the extract fractions as curative and prophylactic antimalarial was then evaluated in THM using Plasmodium berghei-infected mice at a dose of 100\u00a0mg/kg. The extract fraction with the highest activity was further evaluated at varying doses and its effect on \u03b4-ALAD was measured using RT-qPCR. The percentage of parasitemia and chemosuppression, and mean survival time were used as indices of activity.", "Phytochemical analysis revealed that the ethyl acetate and aqueous extract fractions contained high terpenoids, flavonoids, and phenols levels. However, alkaloids were only present in moderate quantities in the aqueous extract, and quinones were found in high levels only in the crude extract. Additionally, all extract fractions contained saponins in high levels but lacked tannins. While the plant extracts were found to be non-toxic, they did not exhibit curative antimalarial activity. However, all extract fractions showed prophylactic antimalarial activity, with the ethyl acetate extract having the highest percentage of chemosuppression even at doses of 250 and 1000\u00a0mg/kg. In the negative control, the expression of \u03b4-ALAD was 5.4-fold, but this was significantly reduced to 2.3-fold when mice were treated with 250\u00a0mg/kg of the ethyl acetate fraction. GC-MS analysis of the ethyl acetate fraction revealed high percentages of 2-methyloctacosane, tetracosane, and decane.", "The fractions extracted from S. incanum leaves have been found to possess only antimalarial prophylactic properties, with the ethyl acetate extract fraction showing the most effective results. The activity of this fraction may be attributed to its ability to decrease the expression of \u03b4-ALAD, as it contains an alkane compound implicated with enzyme-inhibitory activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
