Despite numerous phytochemical and pharmacological studies, there is a lack of systematic studies to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory activity of this plant.", "This study aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of the dichloromethane fraction from M. bealei leaves (MBL-CH).", "RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with different concentrations of MBL-CH for 30min prior to treatment with 1\u03bcg/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway and subsequent production of inflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 were investigated. Furthermore, the in vivo mouse model of LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI) was employed to study the anti-inflammatory effects of MBL-CH.", "Pre-treatment with MBL-CH significantly inhibited the LPS-stimulated secretion of NO, PGE2, and TNF-\u03b1 into the culture medium, as well as the mRNA levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and TNF-\u03b1, which were associated with a reduction in the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, Akt, and PI3K and inhibition of the transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB. Furthermore, in vivo experiments revealed that MBL-CH attenuated LPS-stimulated lung inflammation in mice.", "Taken together, our findings indicate that MBL-CH attenuates LPS-stimulated inflammatory responses in macrophages by blocking NF-\u03baB activation through interference with activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, providing scientific evidence that the plant can be employed in traditional remedies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
