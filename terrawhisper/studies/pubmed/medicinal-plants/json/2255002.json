The incidence of liver cancer was 14.3% in the experimental group and 100% in the control group, with the difference being statistically significant. Degeneration and necrosis of the hepatocytes in the experimental group were milder than in the control group. Histochemical studies also revealed that the activity of SDH, 5'-NT and gamma-GT, and the amounts of DNA, RNA and glycogen in the experimental group were maintained at relatively normal level, and decreased or increased in the control group. The results obtained in our experimental studies indicated that the ginseng seems to play a role of protecting the hepatocyte from injury by DEN, thereby inhibiting the development of liver cancer induced by DEN."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Tongji Medical University, Wuhan."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "X G", "Initials": "XG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "D H", "Initials": "DH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "J Tongji Med Univ", "NlmUniqueID": "8605495", "ISSNLinking": "0257-716X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3IQ78TTX1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Diethylnitrosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diethylnitrosamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Histocytochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Eur J Cancer. 1979 Jun;15(6):885-92", "ArticleIdList": ["227695"]}, {"Citation": "Experientia. 1979 Dec 15;35(12):1647-9", "ArticleIdList": ["520487"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2255002", "10.1007/BF02986451"]}}]}
