However, some of these varieties are used by indigenous populations for the treatment of diarrhoea, stomach ache, external wounds, intestinal worms and ulcers.", "This study describes an overview of the botanical diversity, medicinal uses, phytochemical composition of C. variegatum. Then it critically discusses its pharmacological activities versus toxic potential and new perspectives are suggested for the development of its plant-based products.", "A bibliographic assessment of publications on C. variegatum indexed in Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Springer Link, and Web of Science online databases was conducted from 1970 to 2020, and 89 relevant articles related to the botanical diversity (17), traditional uses (22), phytochemical analysis (11), pharmacological activity (31) and toxicity profile (18) of C. variegatum were selected for this review.", "Most commonly, it was found that aqueous leaf extracts or decoctions of C. variegatum are used in traditional medicine to treat amoebic dysentery and stomach ache while a bath with root decoction or sap is applied in small quantities on skin related infections. A total of 14 identified and 24 non-identified varieties of C. variegatum were reported for pharmacological activity, and prominent research topics include the anti-amoebic, antimicrobial, antiviral and cytotoxic activities. Alkaloids (3), terpenoids (5) and phenolics (15) were the major compounds identified, and a new antiviral cyanoglucoside was isolated from the sap of C. variegatum. Toxic substances (5-deoxyingenol and phorbol esters) were found in some varieties used as ornamental plants, but the Mollucanum variety used in traditional medicine was found to be safe.", "The present review revealed that the native variety of C. variegatum (cv. Mollucanum) can be used to treat amoebic dysentery. Alkaloids, terpenoids and phenolic compounds have been characterized in this plant species while other classes of phytochemicals are not yet investigated. The development of new cultivars recommends an in-depth toxicological study before any use. No clinical trial has been reported to date, and further studies are needed to evaluate other claimed medicinal uses. Due to its efficacy and safety, the Mollucanum variety is most likely suitable for the development of a medicine against amoebiasis, which will surely lay the foundation for clinical studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
