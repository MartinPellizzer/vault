These infections may be difficult to treat and may lead to chronic bone disorders and disabilities, thus the use of new antifungal materials in bone disorders is vital, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, such as those who have contracted coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Herein, we reported for the first time the preparation of nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (N/CQDs) and a nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon (N/MC) using a quick micro-wave preparation and hydrothermal approach. The structure and morphology were analysed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and surface area analyser. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), disc diffusion tests, minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) and antifungal inhibitory percentages were measured to investigate the antifungal activity of N/CQDs and N/MC nanostructures. In addition to the <i>in vivo</i> antifungal activity in rats as determined by wound induction and infection, pathogen count and histological studies were also performed. According to <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> testing, both N/CQDs with small size and N/MC with porous structure had a significant antifungal impact on a variety of bone-infecting bacteria, including Mucor infection. In conclusion, the present investigation demonstrates that functional N/CQDs and N/MC are effective antifungal agents against a range of microbial pathogenic bone disorders in immunocompromised individuals, with stronger and superior fungicidal activity for N/CQDs than N/MC <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1045-0163"],
