This study focused on a pivotal scientific problem of design and application of quality standard of Dao-di herbs, and systematically illustrated the general rules for the quality standard of Dao-di herbs involving &quot;four rules, six core contents, and three key methods&quot;. The quality standard of Dao-di herbs shall be fully based on literatures as well as habitat, planting/breeding, processing, characters, chemical-pharmacological/toxic data. The common requirements for the quality standard of Dao-di herbs contain &quot;clear source, explicit origin, rational indicator, gradable quality, and multiple detection methods&quot;. Notably, traditional experiences and modern techniques, quality tracing management system, &quot;quality determination by distinguishing characters&quot; method, rapid detection technology, effective/toxic substances control method, were comprehensively applied in this standard to purse the objectification, automation, and intellectualization of detection technology. Appearance characters, chemical components, and bioactive parameters, unified effective/toxic indicators, quality markers, and pharmacopeial control indicators and reasonable ranges were included in rigorous quality standards for Dao-di herbs. Besides, simple grading method shall be developed to guide the implementation of &quot;high quality-high price&quot; policy. Eventually, the new quality standards for Dao-di herbs will lead international standards and promote the high-quality development of Dao-di herbs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Chang-Jiang-Sheng", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Xu-Ya", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Zi-Dong", "Initials": "ZD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Pharmaceutical Engineering Center (NPEC) for Solid Preparation in Chinese Herbal Medicine, Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330006, China."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "55"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33496149", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.202027.601"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
