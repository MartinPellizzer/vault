Although these trials were terminated prematurely, they provide the only controlled data regarding the effect of oral milrinone on exercise capacity in patients receiving converting enzyme inhibitors. Of the 254 patients randomized, 140 completed one of the trials or reached an end point and are the basis of this report. In both trials, there was a clear trend for an increase in exercise capacity in the milrinone-treated patients (+26 +/- 8% vs. +5 +/- 7% in MIL-1077 and +11 +/- 5% vs. +2 +/- 4% in MIL-1078). Symptoms of congestive heart failure were decreased in one trial but not the other. Quality of life, as assessed by a questionnaire, was not effected in either trial. There was an increased incidence of adverse events in milrinone-treated patients. Adverse events related primarily to hypotension and vasodilation led to discontinuation of drug in 18 milrinone-treated patients vs. 1 placebo-treated patient. Milrinone had little or no proarrhythmic effect and cardiovascular deaths were distributed equally between the milrinone and placebo groups. These data suggest that when used in combination with a converting enzyme inhibitor, oral milrinone improves exercise capacity but is associated with a high incidence of adverse events that appear to be related to excessive vasodilation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115."}], "LastName": "Colucci", "ForeName": "W S", "Initials": "WS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sonnenblick", "ForeName": "E H", "Initials": "EH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Adams", "ForeName": "K F", "Initials": "KF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Berk", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brozena", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cowley", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grabicki", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kubo", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "LeJemtel", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Littler", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Coll Cardiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8301365", "ISSNLinking": "0735-1097"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JU9YAX04C7", "NameOfSubstance": "Milrinone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Electrocardiography, Ambulatory"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exercise Test"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "mortality", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Failure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Milrinone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Pyridones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8376682", "10.1016/0735-1097(93)90473-e", "0735-1097(93)90473-E"]}}]}
