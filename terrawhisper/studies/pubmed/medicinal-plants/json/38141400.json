However, the function and regulation of protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), a key component of abscisic acid signaling, under abiotic stress are still unknown in cassava, a drought-tolerant crop. In this study, a cassava PP2C gene (MePP2C24) was cloned and characterized. The MePP2C24 transcripts increased in response to mannitol, NaCl, and ABA. Overexpression of MePP2C24 in Arabidopsis resulted in increased sensitivity to drought stress and decreased sensitivity to exogenous ABA. This was demonstrated by transgenic lines having higher levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), ion leakage (IL), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), lower activities of catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD), and lower proline content than wild type (WT) under drought stress. Moreover, MePP2C24 overexpression caused decrease in expression of drought-responsive genes related to ABA signaling pathway. In addition, MePP2C24 was localized in the cell nucleus and showed self-activation. Furthermore, many MePYLs (MePYL1, MePYL4, MePYL7-9, and MePYL11-13) could interact with MePP2C24 in the presence of ABA, and MePYL1 interacted with MePP2C24 in both the presence and absence of ABA. Additionally, MebZIP11 interacted with the promoter of MePP2C24 and exerted a suppressive effect. Taken together, our results suggest that MePP2C24 acts as a negative regulator of drought tolerance and ABA response."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
