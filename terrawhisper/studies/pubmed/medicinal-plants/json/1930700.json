Over a period of 4 weeks, 25 students used either placebo or preparations containing medicinal herbs. Parameters measured were the approximal plaque index (API) and sulcus bleeding index (SBI). These were determined at the same time of day (12:00 P.M.), the last food intake having occurred at least 1 hour previously. Compared with the placebo preparations, the herbal ingredients significantly reduced both the API (initial value: 40.8%, final value: 23.9%) and the SBI (initial value: 33.4%, final value: 18.6%). The pH of the total saliva was significantly displaced into the alkaline range by the application of the herbal products, whereas the placebo products had a contrary effect. The results of this study suggest that herbal ingredients can be employed supportively in the therapy of periodontal diseases and for routine prophylaxis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Out-Patient Clinic for Dental Care and Paradontology, University of Munich."}], "LastName": "Willershausen", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gruber", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hamm", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Clin Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "8904411", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8831"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mouthwashes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toothpastes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Plaque"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Plaque Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Gingival Hemorrhage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mouthwashes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Saliva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Single-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toothpastes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1930700"]}}]}
