Treatment of primary rat astroglial cells cultured in chemically defined medium with LPS resulted in a dose-dependent accumulation of NGF mRNA, and an increased release of NGF protein in the cell medium. NGF mRNA levels were maximal after 24 hr of stimulation (8-fold increase), whereas extracellular NGF peaked after 72 hours of treatment (17-fold increase). This dramatic increase of extracellular NGF was abrogated if cells were treated with actinomycin D or cycloheximide, a fact which implies that the accumulation of extracellular NGF by LPS-treated cells requires DNA transcription and RNA translation. Stimulation of NGF synthesis and secretion was: (i) unaffected by treatment with the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide, and (ii) prevented by forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, two agents which increase cAMP levels. Inhibition of LPS effect was also obtained with apigenin, a proposed inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Results thus show that LPS stimulates NGF synthesis by astroglial cells through a mechanism that is independent of protein kinase C (PKC), antagonized by cAMP-elevating agents, and probably mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. The data raise the possibility that LPS exerts stimulatory effects on NGF synthesis that are independent of those elicited by astrocyte-derived inflammatory lymphokines such as IL-1beta, TNF alpha or TGF beta1."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty Biology, University Complutense, Madrid, Spain."}], "LastName": "Galve-Roperh", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Malpartida", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Haro", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brachet", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "D\u00edaz-Laviada", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Neurosci Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7600111", "ISSNLinking": "0360-4012"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nerve Growth Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Astrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chamomile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nerve Growth Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "9", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9302078", "10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(19970901)49:5<569::AID-JNR7>3.0.CO;2-9", "10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(19970901)49:5<569::AID-JNR7>3.0.CO;2-9"]}}]}
