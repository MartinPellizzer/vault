Thus, we aimed to reveal the morphological and micromorphological differences between <i>A.\u00a0rugosa</i> grown on island and inland areas and their pharmacological effects on gastritis in an animal model by combining morphological and mass spectrophotometric analyses. Morphological analysis showed that island <i>A.\u00a0rugosa</i> had slightly smaller plants and leaves than inland plants; however, the density of all types of trichomes on the leaves, petioles, and stems of island <i>A.\u00a0rugosa</i> was significantly higher than that of inland plants. The essential oil component analysis revealed that pulegone levels were substantially higher in island <i>A.\u00a0rugosa</i> than in inland <i>A.\u00a0rugosa</i>. Despite the differences between island and inland <i>A.\u00a0rugosa</i>, treatment with both island and inland <i>A.\u00a0rugosa</i> reduced gastric damages by more than 40% compared to the gastritis induction group. In addition, expression of inflammatory protein was reduced by about 30% by treatment of island and inland <i>A.\u00a0rugosa.</i> The present study demonstrates quantitative differences in morphology and volatile components between island and inland plants; significant differences were not observed between the gastritis-inhibitory effects of island and inland <i>A.\u00a0rugosa</i>, and the efficacy of island <i>A.\u00a0rugosa</i> was found to be similar to that of <i>A.\u00a0rugosa</i> grown in inland areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Thieme.
