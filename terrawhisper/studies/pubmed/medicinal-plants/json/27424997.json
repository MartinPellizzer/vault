However, the effects of RES on skin cancer have not been investigated. The present work was designed to explore the anticancer potential of RES against chemical-induced skin carcinogenesis in rats.", "Skin carcinogenesis were induced in male Wistar rats by a single topical application of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and 2 weeks later, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were topically applied thrice a week to promote skin carcinogenesis. RES at a dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg body weight/week were administered to DMBA treated rats. The effects of RES on DMBA-modified cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis and protein expressions were analyzed by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and Western blot, respectively.", "RES treatment caused a significant reduction of DMBA-induced tumor occurrence, tumor volume and tumor weight, as compared to DMBA control group. Further, RES treatment increases G2/M arrest and apoptosis by modulating cell-cycle and apoptosis regulated genes such as p53, p21, caspase-3, bax, survivin, cyclin-B and cdc-2 when compared with DMBA control group.", "Taken together, the anticancer effect of RES is associated with regulation of cell-cycle and apoptosis in skin cancer, thereby attenuating skin cancer growth. Hence, these findings suggest that RES may be a therapeutic agent for skin cancer treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, P.R.
