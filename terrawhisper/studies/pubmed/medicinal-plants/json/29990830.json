In the study, we investigated the anti-fibrotic efficacy of flavonoid-rich Scabiosa comosa inflorescence extract (TF-SC) in a rat model of CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced hepatic fibrosis and explored its underlying mechanism in vitro and in vivo. Rats (Wistar, Male, weight 200-250\u202fg) were injected intraperitoneally with CCl<sub>4</sub> (1:1v/v in peanut oil, 2\u202fmL/kg body weight) to induce liver fibrosis, followed by treatment with TF-SC or vehicle. In addition, transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21)-activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were used for measuring Smad3 phosphorylation. We found decrease in liver function and liver fibrosis markers in serums. Also, TF-SC decreased hydroxyproline content and collagen deposition in liver tissues. TF-SC also decreased the expression of \u03b1-SMA, collagen I and fibronectin in CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis rats. Mechanistically, TF-SC attenuated liver fibrosis by selectively inhibiting Smad3 phosphorylation. In TGF-\u03b21-stimulated HSCs, TF-SC blocked the interaction between Smad3 and TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI), suppressed subsequent phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad3, and down-regulated the transcription of fibrotic genes. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that TF-SC was an effective therapeutic agent for treatment of hepatic fibrosis, and provided a molecular basis through which TF-SC exerts its anti-fibrotic effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
