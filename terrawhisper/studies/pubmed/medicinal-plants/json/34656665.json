Parts of these plants, mainly the exudates and the seeds oil are useful for different purposes, especially for treating dermatological conditions. In addition to the role in the folk medicine, some species are of great economic and cultural importance for native people from different continents.", "The goal of this review is to critically summarize the current knowledge on systematics, ethnobotanical, chemical and pharmacological aspects of species from the tribe Symphonieae, as well as to provide support for future taxonomic and phylogenetic studies on the Clusiaceae family.", "The available information was gathered from many different databases (Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Pubmed, ChemSpider, SciFinder, ACS Publications, Wiley Online Library, Useful Tropical Plants Database, Google Scholar). Additional data from books, theses and dissertations were also included in this review.", "Chemical studies of Symphonieae have demonstrated that the genera are a source of benzophenones, xanthones and biflavonoids. Components as sesquiterpenoids, triterpenoids, flavonoids, free fatty acids, among others, have also been reported. Extracts and compounds isolated from a variety of species have been exhibiting antimicrobial, cytotoxic and antiprotozoal activities, corroborating part of their medicinal uses. In addition, certain species produce edible fruits and a kind of \"butter\" with economic importance. All species produce exudate, which often has great relevance in the daily lives of local people.", "Several species of Symphonieae have potential therapeutic applications and some of them have been investigated to scientifically validate their popular uses. In addition, a number of species have proved to be a rich source of promising pharmacologically active compounds. Finally, the value of fruits, exudate and butter, for instance, should serve as a stimulus for the sustainable development of products that aim to take advantage of these natural resources."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
