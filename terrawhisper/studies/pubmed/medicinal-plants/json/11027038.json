Their mixtures were then soaked and solid-state fermented by Rhizopus oligosporus to produce tempe. Soaking resulted in the loss of minerals. Mould fermentation did not change the proximate and mineral composition, but increased the in vitro protein digestibility by 10 to 14.1%. Tempe processing reduced the tannin content by 30.4 to 94.0%. The protein content of tempe ranged from 16.0 to 18.6%; the amino acid score, 63.0 to 69.0%; protein energy, 14.2 to 16.8%; net dietary protein energy, 7.3 to 8.4%; and total energy, 416.0 to 441.0 Kcal/100 g of tempe. The developed tempe had protein quality and energy recommended for weaning foods. The deep-fried snacks were mildly acceptable. More research work and promotion are proposed in order to improve the acceptability of sorghum-based tempe as potential weaning or supplementary foods in Tanzania."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sokoine University of Agriculture, Department of Food Science and Technology, Morogoro, Tanzania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mugula", "ForeName": "J K", "Initials": "JK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lyimo", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "9432922", "ISSNLinking": "0963-7486"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tanzania"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weaning"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11027038", "10.1080/09637480050077158"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
