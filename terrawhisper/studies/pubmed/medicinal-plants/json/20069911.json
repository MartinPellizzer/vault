(belonging to the family Ranunculaceae) were systematiically reviewed in this article. The plants in this genus have a wide spectrum of constituents as follows: triterpenes, flavonoids, lignans, coumarins, alkaloids, volatile oils, steroids, organic acids, macrocyclic compounds and phenols, etc., among which triterpenoid saponins, flavonoids and lignans are the main components. The triterpenoid saponins are mainly oleanolic type and hederagenin type, most of which are bidesmosidic saponins, substituted with oligosaccharide chains at both C-3 and C-28, and some are substituted with acetyl, caffeoyl, isoferuloyl, p-methoxy cinnamyl and 3,4-dimethoxy cinnamyl groups in the oligosaccharide chains. The flavonoids from Clematis species are mainly flavones, flavonols, flavanones, isoflavones, xanthones and their glucosides (sugar moieties are connected to the aglycone through either the oxygen or the carbon atoms), the aglycones of which are mainly apigenin, kaempferol, luteolin and quercetin. The lignans from Clematis are mainly eupomatene lignans, cyclolignans, monoepoxylignans, bisepoxylignans and lignanolides. Clematis spp. are rich in resources, however, studies on their chemical constituents have only been carried out on twenty or so spp. As a result, it is necessary to expand our study on other spp. from this genus for better utilization of medicinal resources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. sunfeng@mail.sysu.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Depo", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Clematis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "96"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20069911"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
