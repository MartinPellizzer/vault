Jordan does not currently have a national policy on traditional medicine (TM) and/or complementary/alternative medicine (CAM). The present study aims to explore the use of and beliefs about the efficacy of medicinal plants among the Jordanian population. <i>Method:</i> A cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administrated questionnaire for the duration between April and June 2019. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of positive attitudes towards the use of medicinal plants. Results: A total of 1,057 individuals participated in the study. The participants in our study showed a positive attitude towards the use of medicinal plants and herbs (median score of 33.0 (interquartile range (IQR): 26.0-37.0; equals 68.8% of the maximum total score), and believed in alternative therapies other than chemical drugs for disease treatment, mainly using medicinal herbs and plants. The majority of the participants (77.8% (n = 822)) believe in the efficacy of the use of medicinal herbs and plants and are aware (64.6 % (n = 683)) of the correct and proper way of using these plants and herbs. Pharmacists and herbalist are the main sources of information for the proper use of medicinal herbs and plants. Age was the main predictor of positive attitudes towards the use of medicinal plants and herbs (P<0.001). <i>Conclusion:</i> Efforts must be made to regulate the dispensing of these products, to educate health service providers and to raise consumer awareness."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023, Sweiss et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Basic Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Isra University, Amman, JOR."}], "LastName": "Sweiss", "ForeName": "Kanar", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Pharmaceutical Sciences and Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Isra University, Amman, JOR."}], "LastName": "Naser", "ForeName": "Abdallah Y", "Initials": "AY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Pharmaceutical Sciences and Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Isra University, Amman, JOR."}], "LastName": "Tayseer", "ForeName": "Abdel-Rahman", "Initials": "AR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Natural product drug discovery in the next millennium.
