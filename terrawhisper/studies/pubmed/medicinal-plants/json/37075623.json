Despite great advances in the therapeutic strategies, the survival rate in the past decades of patients with breast cancer remains unsatisfactory. Growing evidence has demonstrated that Curcumae Rhizoma, called Ezhu in Chinese, showed various pharmacological properties, including anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities. It has been widely used in Chinese medicine to treat many types of human cancer.", "To comprehensively summarize and analyze the effects of active substances in Curcumae Rhizoma on breast cancer malignant phenotypes and the underlying mechanisms, as well as discuss its medicinal value and future perspectives.", "We used \"Curcumae Rhizoma\" or the name of crude extracts and bioactive components in Curcumae Rhizoma in combination with \"breast cancer\" as key words. Studies focusing on their anti-breast cancer activities and mechanisms of action were extracted from Pubmed, Web of Science and CNKI databases up to October 2022. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guideline was followed.", "Crude extracts and 7 main bioactive phytochemicals (curcumol, \u03b2-elemene, furanodiene, furanodienone, germacrone, curdione and curcumin) isolated from Curcumae Rhizoma have shown many anti-breast cancer pharmacological properties, including inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, invasion and stemness, reversing chemoresistance, and inducing cell apoptosis, cycle arrest and ferroptosis. The mechanisms of action were involved in regulating MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. In vivo and clinical studies demonstrated that these compounds exhibited high anti-tumor efficacy and safety against breast cancer.", "These findings provide strong evidence that Curcumae Rhizoma acts as a rich source of phytochemicals and has robust anti-breast cancer properties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier GmbH.
