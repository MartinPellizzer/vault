The bulk density, reconstitutability, foam properties and emulsification properties of flour samples in water, 1% saline and 1% alkali were studied. There were no significant differences (p > or = 0.05) in the proximate composition of seeds from different agroclimatic zones. The energy content of seeds were comparable to that of other legume seeds (5.7 kcal/g for A. africana and 4.5 kcal/g for B. eurycoma seeds). Foam properties of B. eurycoma seeds were found to be better than that of A. africana seeds in terms of foam volume and stability. Emulsification properties of B. eurycoma seeds were also found to be better than A. africana seeds suggesting that B. eurycoma seeds would be more efficient in food systems requiring the formation of stable foams and emulsions. Protein solubility in alkali was found to be better than in water and in 1% saline. The bulk densities and reconstitution indices of flour samples from the two seeds were found to be similar."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Agriculture, Abia State University, Uturu, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Madubuike", "ForeName": "F N", "Initials": "FN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ojimelukwe", "ForeName": "P C", "Initials": "PC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ajah", "ForeName": "P O", "Initials": "PO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fats"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7716116", "10.1007/BF01088434"]}}]}
