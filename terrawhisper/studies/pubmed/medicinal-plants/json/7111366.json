Carbowax 20 M, OV 225 and OV 330 are well suited for separating this group of active agents. A NP-FID was used as a gas chromatographic detector. Sample preparation was optimized. Chloroform (as an extracting agent) and the shaking method were best suited for extracting. The samples were purified by column chromatography, DMSO/petroleum ether partition and purification by extraction from a hydrochloric solution being performed subsequently if necessary. The recovery rates and the reproducibility observed for various drugs and different extraction methods were compared.
