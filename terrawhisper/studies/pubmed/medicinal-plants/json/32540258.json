We also evaluated anti-hypertensive activity of NSL-EPE using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR): blood pressure was measured weekly by non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurements; hemodynamic parameters, biochemical and clinical chemistry variables in plasma, serum and kidney tissue were measured after 10 weeks of treatment with NSL-EPE as well.\u2028 RESULTS: UHPLC-quadrupole-orbitrap-MS analysis identified 52 compounds, of which 40 compounds were reported for the first time in N. sibirica. 11 phenolic compounds further quantitatively analyzed, among which the most abundant compound was found to be clovin (8.8%). Systolic blood pressure decreased progressively from the second treatment week compared to that in non-treated SHRs. The plasma endothelin, aldosterone, angiotensin II levels were significantly increased, while the level of NO<sub>X</sub> was significantly decreased; glutathione to oxidized glutathione ratio, superoxide dismutase and total catalase levels in the kidney tissue were markedly accelerated, while malondialdehyde level was significantly reduced in NSL-EPE treated SHRs. Moreover, the serum cholesterol, triglyceride, blood uria nitrogen and creatinine were attenuated in NSL-EPE treated SHRs (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but in sharp contrast to those values in the water-treated SHRs.", "This study screened out leading compounds from N. sibirica and offered a new understanding of the antihypertensive properties of N. sibirica leaves, by which inhibit oxidative stress-induced endothelial dysfunction and improve lipid profiles."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
