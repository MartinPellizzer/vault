In Pakistan T. glabra is found in the region of Balochistan only. T. glabra has numerous therapeutic uses in traditional medicine and it is also used for the pain relief. Current study was carried out to evaluate acute toxicity, analgesic and CNS depressant activity of the plant. Acute toxicity was carried out by oral administration of the T. glabra extract from 250 to 2000mg/kg oral dose. Analgesic activity was carried out by acetic acid induced writhing test and formalin test. Central Nervous System (CNS) depressant activity was carried out by exploratory activities (open field activity, cage crossing activity, rearing test) and forced swimming test. Oral administration of the methanolic extract of T. glabra was nontoxic at the dose of 1500mg/kg in the acute toxicity test. Exploratory behavior of mice treated with the methanolic extract of T. glabra showed sedative effects (P<0.05) in open field, cage crossing, traction and rearing test, particularly at the dose of 500mg as compared with standard drug Diazepam. In forced swimming test, mobility time was significantly (P<0.05) increased at 500mg/kg oral dose, and results were significant as compared with control. Methanolic extract of T. glabra produced significant (P<0.05) analgesic effects at the dose of 500mg/kg in the acetic acid induced writhing test and the formalin test. In conclusion, results show that the crude methanolic extract of T. glabra possess sedative as well as potent analgesic effects. Present pharmacological studies are the first ever studies conducted on the methanolic extract of T. glabra."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Balochistan, Quetta, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Marvi", "ForeName": "-", "Initials": "-"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Balochistan, Quetta, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Iqbal", "ForeName": "Javeid", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Balochistan, Quetta, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Muhammad", "ForeName": "Shafi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Mansoor", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypnotics and Sedatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1HG84L3525", "NameOfSubstance": "Formaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Formaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hypnotics and Sedatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pain Threshold"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests, Acute"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28167475"]}}]}
