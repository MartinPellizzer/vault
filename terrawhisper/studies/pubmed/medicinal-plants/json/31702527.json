The awareness of curative features of different medicinal plants has been spread among human communities. The application of herbal products as antimicrobial agents may be a better choice for the extensive and imprudent use of synthetic antibiotics. World Health Organization recommended traditional medicines as the safest remedies for the treatment of diseases of microbial origin. The plant extracts are generally nonhazardous, available in plenty at reasonable prices, biodegradable, eco-friendly and sometimes show broad-spectrum activities against different microorganisms. The current knowledge on plant extracts, phytochemicals and their antibacterial activity, target specific mechanism of action, solvents deployed during extraction, properties of an active ingredient isolated may help in biological control of bacteria. Antimicrobial properties of different plant parts, which act in a low dose, have been organised separately for easy understanding."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mosquito Microbiology and Nanotechnology Research Units, Parasitology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, The University of Burdwan, Burdwan-713104, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Chandra", "ForeName": "Goutam", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mosquito Microbiology and Nanotechnology Research Units, Parasitology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, The University of Burdwan, Burdwan-713104, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Mukherjee", "ForeName": "Devaleena", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mosquito Microbiology and Nanotechnology Research Units, Parasitology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, The University of Burdwan, Burdwan-713104, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Ray", "ForeName": "Anushree Singha", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mosquito Microbiology and Nanotechnology Research Units, Parasitology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, The University of Burdwan, Burdwan-713104, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Chatterjee", "ForeName": "Soroj", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mosquito Microbiology and Nanotechnology Research Units, Parasitology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, The University of Burdwan, Burdwan-713104, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Bhattacharjee", "ForeName": "Indranil", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Discov Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "101157212", "ISSNLinking": "1570-1638"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31702527", "10.2174/1570163816666191106103730", "CDDT-EPUB-102130"]}}]}
