In this work, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method (UPLC-MS/MS) was firstly developed and validated to quantify kaurenoic acid in rat plasma. Rhein was chosen as the internal standard (IS) and the plasma was processed with one-step acetonitrile protein precipitation; the chromatographic separation was achieved on a HSS T3 (2.1\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009mm, 1.8\u2009\u03bcm) column with the mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% formic acid via gradient elution. An electrospray ionization source was applied and operated in the negative ion and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) modes. Kaurenoic acid and IS were quantified using the transitions of m/z 301.2\u2192301.2 (pseudo MRM) and m/z 283.2 \u2192 238.9, respectively. The calibration curves were linear over the range of 5\u223c 100\u2009ng/mL (R<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.990). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 5\u2009ng/mL. The intra- and inter- day precision (RSD) ranged from 3.0% to 11.4%. The matrix effect and extraction recovery were within acceptable limits. The validated method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of kaurenoic acid in rats after oral administration at three dosages."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
