A chimeric protein consisting of the presequence of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) small subunit fused to the mature Rieske protein sequence was imported by chloroplasts, processed in the stroma, and translocated into the thylakoids, indicating that the thylakoid-targeting information was located within the mature Rieske protein. A truncated Rieske protein precursor consisting of the presequence and the N-terminal 55 amino acids of the mature protein was imported by chloroplasts and routed to the thylakoids, indicating that the thylakoid-targeting domain of the Rieske protein is located within the predominantly hydrophobic N-terminal region of the mature protein. Chimeric proteins consisting of this truncated Rieske protein precursor fused to the mature Rubisco small subunit and to plastocyanin were efficiently imported by chloroplasts and translocated across the thylakoid membrane. A proton-motive force was necessary for thylakoid translocation of the mature Rieske protein, the truncated Rieske protein, and the fusion protein consisting of the truncated Rieske protein and the mature Rubisco small subunit. In contrast, plastocyanin and the fusion of the truncated Rieske protein with plastocyanin were translocated across the thylakoid membrane in the presence of nigericin and valinomycin, indicating that the energy requirement for thylakoid translocation was conferred by the passenger protein and not by the thylakoid-targeting sequence."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Madue\u00f1o", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bradshaw", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gray", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Primers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron-Sulfur Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Fusion Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Rieske iron-sulfur protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 7.1.1.8", "NameOfSubstance": "Electron Transport Complex III"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Primers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport Complex III"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intracellular Membranes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Iron-Sulfur Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Fusion Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8021250", "S0021-9258(17)32462-6"]}}]}
