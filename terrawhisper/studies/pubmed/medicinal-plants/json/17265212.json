MS medium containing Kn or BAP (5.0 mg/l (-1)) in combination with IAA (1.0 mg/l (-1)) induced an optimal growth of shoots within 6-8 days from both apical and axillary bud explants. The roots developed on the same medium within 2-3 weeks. Hardening of IN VITRO grown plantlets in pots under glass-house conditions was dependent upon the temperature and humidity. A cold-temperate climate favoured early establishment. Following the given procedure, a large number of plants have been established under field conditions at two locations. The method has implications in the early introduction of an elite population as well as its improvement."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Plant Tissue Culture, Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP), P.B.
