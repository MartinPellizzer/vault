Dysuria is common in pelvic, especially prostate radiotherapy, but there is not any established and confirmed treatment for this therapeutic side effect. Therefore, an alternative therapeutic method, using herbal preparation, may be an effective solution. This study seeks a defensible suggestion in Iranian Traditional Medicine (ITM). In ITM, a few medicinal herbs such as Plantago psyllium, Cydonia oblonga, Portulaca oleracea and some species of Malvaceae and Cucurbitaceae family are indicated in treating dysuria secondary to urethral moisturizing layer defect and inflammatory disorders. Most of these herbs have mucilaginous characteristics and tissue regeneration ability. This choice can be an appropriate one for radiotherapy-induced dysuria as it is produced by a similar pathophysiology with bladder cell layer injury and urethritis. Pharmacological properties such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-ulcerogenic activity of the offered herbs make its use justifiable. In lack of sufficient clinical trials to clarify the clinical outcome, further clinical investigation seems to be necessary."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
