According to the data in 63 distribution sites and 49 ecological variables, using MaxEnt ecological niche model and 3S technology, we performed a quantitative analysis of suitable distribution and planting GAP of C. officinalis in China. Our results show that: \u2460 the area of suitable distribution of C. officinalis is about 634 385.80 km\u00b2 in total, and mainly in Northeastern and Southeastern Sichuan, Northern and Southeastern Yunnan, Western and Southwestern Guizhou, Southwestern and Northeastern Chongqing, Southwestern Shaanxi, Southeastern Gansu, Western Guangxi, Southeastern Tibet. \u2461 The main ecological factors determining the potential distribution are precipitation, altitude, minimum temperature of coldest month, soil type, monthly mean temperature. \u2462 The planting GAP region are mainly in Guangyuan, Mianyang, Ya'an, Leshan, Liangshan, Panzhihua of Sichuan province, Hanzhong of Shaanxi province, Dali, Nujiang, Chuxiong, Baoshan, Qujing, Wenshan of Yunnan province, southwestern autonomous prefecture in Guizhou province. The results are of great significance for realizing the growth environment, predicting the potential distribution and promoting planting popularization for C. officinalis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Laboratory, Faculty of Geography and Resources Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610101, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Land Resources Evaluation and Monitoring in Southwest, Ministry of Education, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610068, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ming-Yan", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Laboratory, Faculty of Geography and Resources Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610101, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Land Resources Evaluation and Monitoring in Southwest, Ministry of Education, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610068, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Lan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Laboratory, Faculty of Geography and Resources Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610101, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Land Resources Evaluation and Monitoring in Southwest, Ministry of Education, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610068, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jia-Li", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Laboratory, Faculty of Geography and Resources Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610101, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Land Resources Evaluation and Monitoring in Southwest, Ministry of Education, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610068, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Guang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Laboratory, Faculty of Geography and Resources Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610101, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Land Resources Evaluation and Monitoring in Southwest, Ministry of Education, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610068, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Wu-Xue", "Initials": "WX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Altitude"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Amaranthaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Dispersal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tibet"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29318841", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0190"]}}]}
