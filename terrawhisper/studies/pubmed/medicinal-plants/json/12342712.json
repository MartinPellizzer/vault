An ethnographic study conducted in 1980-1981 of 180 women and 126 women investigated use of specific herbal remedies in this highland area. The largest number of reproduction-related medicinal plants used San Francisco are for postpartum recovery. In fact, 80% of the women interviewed reported using only herbal remedies after their last delivery. These remedies are relied on to restore lost blood, heal the birth scar, and stop bleeding. Of the 40% of respondents who reported postpartum hemorrhaging, 70% used herbal remedies. Several of the plants used to treat menorrhagia and hemorrhaging are also used for infertility. The infertility remedies are believed to cleanse the blood and uterus, heal or strengthen the back so the fetus can adhere, help the womb retain the fetus, and cool the blood. Both infertility and miscarriage are attributed to incomplete postpartum recovery. Another large group of medicinal remedies is employed to speed labor or ease labor pains. These remedies are thought to stimulate blood flow or uterine contractions. An additional 15 plants are used to prevent or terminate pregnancy. The mechanism of action in these case is believed to be to both warm the blood to facilitate its flow and irritate the uterus so it will evacuate its contents. Reliance on these remedies derives from Chinantec ethnomedical understandings. Given the persistence of use of herbal remedies in many communities in the Third World, research is needed on their safety and efficacy."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["058632", "00192775"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: ECONOMIC BOTANY"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Abortifacient Agents", "Abortion, Drug Induced", "Abortion, Induced", "Americas", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Diseases", "Family Planning", "Fertility Control, Postconception", "Health", "Health Services", "Infertility", "Latin America", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Menorrhagia", "Menstruation Disorders", "Mexico", "North America", "Plants, Medicinal--therapeutic use", "Pregnancy", "Puerperium", "Reproduction", "Research Methodology", "Sampling Studies", "Self Care", "Studies", "Surveys", "Treatment"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12342712", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1991", "Month": "04", "Day": "15"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "27"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0013-0001", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "39", "Issue": "4", "PubDate": {"Year": "1985", "Season": "Oct-Dec"}}, "Title": "Economic botany", "ISOAbbreviation": "Econ Bot"}, "ArticleTitle": "Plants used for reproductive health in Oaxaca, Mexico.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "482", "EndPage": "504", "MedlinePgn": "482-504"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Browner", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Econ Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "0007275", "ISSNLinking": "0013-0001"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abortifacient Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abortion, Induced"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Americas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Data Collection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Family Planning Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infertility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Latin America"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Menorrhagia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Menstruation Disturbances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "North America"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Postpartum Period"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sampling Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Self Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Therapeutics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "J Ethnopharmacol. 1983 Aug;8(2):215-23", "ArticleIdList": ["6645571"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12342712", "10.1007/BF02858757"]}}]}
