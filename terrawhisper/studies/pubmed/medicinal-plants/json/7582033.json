When foliage was inoculated with plasmid-containing bacteria, the plasmid was lost from the majority of the cells within 2 d but was stably maintained in 0.8% of the population. A high frequency of conjugation between added donors and recipients was observed under high humidity conditions. In 1 d, the number of transconjugants rose to 10(-1) of the donors and the proportional level of transconjugants continued to increase until 3 d after inoculation. Under these conditions the proportion of plasmid-containing bacteria stabilized at about 0.8% of the total population. The conjugation rate appeared to be in equilibrium with plasmid loss and the slower growth of the plasmid-carrying cells. A factor that influenced the high conjugation frequency observed was the available nutrients provided by the leaf and also, to a lesser extent, the leaf surface itself. Transfer of the plasmid from added donors to indigenous bacteria was also studied, using a donor-specific bacteriophage for counterselection of the donor. Transfer was observed to 10 different species of Gram-negative epiphytically growing bacteria. The bean leaf surface appears to function as a hotspot at least for intraspecific transfer of plasmids in high humidity. The frequency of transfer was higher than in soil or in rhizosphere habitats. This is likely to be the result of an environment that is nutritionally rich in combination with a limited colonizable surface area which permits close contact between the bacterial cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, University of Helsinki, Finland."}], "LastName": "Bj\u00f6rkl\u00f6f", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Suoniemi", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Haahtela", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Romantschuk", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Microbiology (Reading)", "NlmUniqueID": "9430468", "ISSNLinking": "1350-0872"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conjugation, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plasmids"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas Phages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Selection, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7582033", "10.1099/13500872-141-10-2719"]}}]}
