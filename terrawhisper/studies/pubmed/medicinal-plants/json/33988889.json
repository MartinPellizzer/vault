Immunologically, mTOR is a critical regulator of immune function through integrating numerous signals from the immune microenvironment, which coordinates the functions of immune cells and T cell fate decisions. The crucial role of mTOR in immune responses has been lately even more appreciated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, small, noncoding single-stranded RNAs that act as molecular regulators involved in multiple processes during immune cells development, homeostasis, activation and effector polarization. Several studies have recently indicated that a range of miRNAs are involved in regulating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mTOR (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) signaling pathway by targeting multiple components of this signaling pathway and modulating the expression and function of these targets. Current evidence has revealed the interplay between miRNAs and the mTOR pathway circuits in various immune cell types. The expression of individual miRNA can affect the function of mTOR signaling to determine the cell fate decisions in immune responses through coordinating immune signaling and cell metabolism. Dysregulation of the mTOR pathway/miRNAs crosstalk has been reported in cancers and various immune-related diseases. Thus, expression profiles of dysregulated miRNAs could influence the mTOR pathway, resulting in the promotion of aberrant immunity. This review summarizes the latest information regarding the reciprocal role of the mTOR signaling pathway and miRNAs in orchestrating immune responses."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 Australian and New Zealand Society for Immunology, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shiraz Institute for Cancer Research, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nazari", "ForeName": "Nazanin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jafari", "ForeName": "Farzaneh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghalamfarsa", "ForeName": "Ghasem", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hadinia", "ForeName": "Abolghasem", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Atapour", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ahmadi", "ForeName": "Majid", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Research Center, Aging Research Institute, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Dolati", "ForeName": "Sanam", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rostamzadeh", "ForeName": "Davood", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Immunol Cell Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8706300", "ISSNLinking": "0818-9641"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "MicroRNAs"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "MicroRNAs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Bartel DP.
