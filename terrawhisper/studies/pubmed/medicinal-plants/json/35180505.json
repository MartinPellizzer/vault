ADHD impairs attention, response control, emotion regulation, and other cognitive functions. On the other hand, RehaCom is a cognitive rehabilitation software that has therapeutic effects on cognitive dysfunctions in many diseases such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, and schizophrenia. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effect of treatment with RehaCom on auditory and visual response control, and auditory and visual attention in children with ADHD. Forty patients were selected. The participants were assigned to control (n\u00a0=\u00a020) and experimental (n\u00a0=\u00a020) groups, while only the participants in the experimental group were trained by RehaCom for five weeks (ten 45-min sessions, two sessions per week). At weeks 0 and 5, performance of the participants of experimental group was compared with the participants of control group. The results showed that treatment with RehaCom significantly improved auditory and visual response control in children with ADHD, with no effect on auditory and visual attention. In conclusion, RehaCom may alter brain's structural and functional properties that are related to response control. We suggest that attention deficit in ADHD may be a result of more complicated dysfunctions in the brain, that are not affected by RehaCom."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
