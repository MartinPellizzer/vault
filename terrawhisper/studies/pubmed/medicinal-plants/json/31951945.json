Considering, higher accumulation of SGs in vegetative phase followed by decrement during reproductive phase necessitate the understanding of different molecular components of floral transition to develop superior varieties/cultivars with prolonged vegetative phase in Stevia. Current comparative transcriptional analysis of low dose (5\u00a0kR) gamma-irradiated mutant genotype (SMG) with prolonged vegetative phase vis-\u00e0-vis background genotype (SBG) identified DGEs of major floral transition pathways, and expressed according to their physiological fate irrespective to SMG & SBG. Contrarily, reduced expression of floral integrator genes (FT and LEAFY) in mutant genotype suggests their involvement in prolonged vegetative phase phenotype. Likewise, GO and KEGG enrichment of photosynthesis and carbon assimilation efficiency might be associated with prolonged vegetative phase and higher accumulation of Stevioside content in mutant genotype. Furthermore, deviation of flowering related transcription factors (higher expressions except MIKS-type MADS-box SMG_PV compared to SBG_F) may possibly be correlated with low expression of floral integrator genes. Findings of current studies will facilitate the genetic manipulations and crop improvement efforts in Stevia through conventional breeding and genome editing approaches for increased SGs biosynthesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
