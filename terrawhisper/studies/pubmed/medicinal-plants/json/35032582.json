Despite the great diversity of medicinal plants, cultural history, and variety of herbal medicine uses among Kurdish tribes, very few cohesive ethnopharmacological studies of this unique region are available in the scientific literature. Our study tried to gather medicinal plant species and document the associated indigenous knowledge of the ethnic groups in the Sarvabad district for the first time.", "Ethnobotanical data were collected from 92 local informants through semi-structured questionnaires, open interviews, and field surveys during a period of two years (2018-2020). The statistical analysis included use reports (UR) for each species, and informant consensus factor (FIC) to evaluate the data.", "In the present study a total of 156 plant species belonging to 58 botanical families, were recorded for the treatment of 16 diseases categories. The most represented families were Lamiaceae, followed by Asteraceae, and Apiaceae. The most frequently cited plant species with the highest use report (UR) were Pistacia atlantica (161), Hymenocrater longiflorus (128), Melissa officinalis (124), Cyperus rotundus (114), Thymus transcaspicus (112), and Quercus brantii (109). Psychological (ICF\u00a0=\u00a00.96), musculoskeletal (ICF\u00a0=\u00a00.94), and digestive (ICF\u00a0=\u00a00.93), followed by respiratory problems (ICF\u00a0=\u00a00.92) showed the highest informant consensus factors among all ailment categories. Most herbal remedies were consumed as decoction. Leaves (28.5%) were the most widely used plant parts, followed by flowers (18.7%), aerial parts (14.5%), seeds (13.2%), and terrestrial parts (8.41%). Some interesting new medicinal uses for native and common species were reported. Species such as Cyperus rotundus, Hymenocrater longiflorus, Anthriscus nemorosa, Pistacia atlantica and Quercus brantii would be interesting targets for drug discovery and are suggested for further investigations.", "The plant use reports, and quantitative data analyzed demonstrate that the relative importance of plant species and shared knowledge of herbal therapies among Kurdish communities of the Sarvabad county is still rich. A systematic study and evaluation of the biological activity of highly consumed plants, could identify the possible mechanism of action."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
