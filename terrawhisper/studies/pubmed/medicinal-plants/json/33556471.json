Understanding mechanisms of resistance to therapeutic drugs may unravel strategies to overcome or prevent them. We previously identified phorbol ester (PE) compounds such as TPA that induce Protein Kinase \u03b4 (PKC\u03b4), thereby suppressing leukemogenesis. Here we identified erythroleukemia cell lines that resist PEs and showed that reduced PKC\u03b4 protein expression underlies drug resistance. Reduced level of PKC\u03b4 in resistant cell lines was due to its phosphorylation followed by protein degradation. Indeed, proteasome inhibition prevented PE-induced loss of PKC\u03b4. Accordingly, a combination of TPA and the proteasome inhibitor ALLN significantly suppressed leukemia in a mouse model of leukemia. PKC\u03b4 downregulation by TPA was independent of the downstream MAPK/ERK/P38/JNK pathway. Instead, expression of ubiquitin-associated and SH3 domain-containing protein b (Ubash3b) was induced by TPA, which leads to PKC\u03b4 protein dephosphorylation and degradation. This specific degradation was blocked by RNAi-mediated depletion of Ubash3b. In drug-sensitive leukemic cells, TPA did not induce Ubash3b, and consequently, PKC\u03b4 levels remained high. A PE-resistant cell line derived from PE-treated sensitive cells exhibited very low PKC\u03b4 expression. In these drug resistance cells, a Ubash3b independent mechanism led to PKC\u03b4 degradation. Thus, PE compounds in combination with proteasome or specific inhibitors for Ubash3b, or other factors can overcome resistance to TPA, leading to durable suppression of leukemic growth. These results identify Ubash3b as a potential target for drug development."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
