The various ethnic groups of these regions use the plant as a medication for relieving a wide spectrum of diseases and conditions, including indigestion, boils, fever, gout, piles, eczema, asthma, ulcers, bronchitis, epilepsy, and hepatitis B. This review aims to appraise the vernacular information, botanical characterization, geographical distribution, traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacological activities of S. roxburghii as well as to conduct a critical analysis on the findings. To understand the therapeutic potential and provide an overall idea about the ethnomedicinal practices, phytochemistry, and pharmacological activities of S. roxburghii, relevant information was collected via a library and electronic search of online journals, books, and reputed databases. Phytochemical examination revealed the presence of alkaloids, glycosides, O-glycosides, flavonoids, carbohydrates, saponins, steroids, reducing sugars, tannins, phlobatannins, and triterpenoids. The sterols were identified as Stigmasterol and beta-Sitosterol. The triterpenes were found to be Ursolic acid, Corosolic acid, Maslinic acid, 24-Hydroxy corosolic acid, 3b,7b,24-trihydroxy-urs-12-en-28-oic acid, Oleanolic acid, beta-Amyrin, cis-3-O-p-Hydroxycinnamoyl ursolic acid, trans-3-O-p- Hydroxycinnamoyl ursolic acid, and 7,24-dihydroxyursolic acid. Several in-vivo and in-vitro tests revealed anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-oxidant, and anti-viral activities of the plant leaves. Detailed analysis of the information collected on S. roxburghii suggested some promising leads for future drug development. However, many scientific gaps were found in the study of this and further extensive investigation is needed to fully understand the mechanism of action of the active constituents and exploit its therapeutic promises."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Science and Technology Chittagong, Chattogram, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Nahrin", "ForeName": "Afsana", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Modeling Drug-Design and Discovery Laboratory, Pharmacology Research Division, BCSIR Laboratories Chattogram, Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Chattogram, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Junaid", "ForeName": "Md", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Chittagong, Chattogram, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Afrose", "ForeName": "Syeda Samira", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Science and Technology Chittagong, Chattogram, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Alam", "ForeName": "Muhammad Shaiful", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Modeling Drug-Design and Discovery Laboratory, Pharmacology Research Division, BCSIR Laboratories Chattogram, Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Chattogram, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Hosen", "ForeName": "S M Zahid", "Initials": "SMZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Modeling Drug-Design and Discovery Laboratory, Pharmacology Research Division, BCSIR Laboratories Chattogram, Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Chattogram, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Akter", "ForeName": "Rasheda", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Modeling Drug-Design and Discovery Laboratory, Pharmacology Research Division, BCSIR Laboratories Chattogram, Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Chattogram, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Sharmin", "ForeName": "Tania", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mini Rev Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101094212", "ISSNLinking": "1389-5575"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Steroids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Actinidiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Steroids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32646358", "10.2174/1389557520666200709175138", "MRMC-EPUB-108029"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
