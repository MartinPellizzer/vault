Malaysia has a diversity and a large number of underutilized fruits that are rich in phenolic compounds. Artoarpus altilis is considered an underutilized fruit that is rich in phenolic compounds. Methanol extracts of A. altilis have been previously found to contain a high content of antioxidant phytochemicals.", "The purpose of the study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity and toxicological effect of methanol fruit extracts against MCF-7 cells. To determine the least concentration that might kill or suppress the growth of the cancer cells was in a concentration-dependent manner.", "The variation in the cytotoxic activity among the extracts was indicated by determining the IC<sub>50</sub> of each extract against cells at 72 h. The IC<sub>50</sub> of the samples was measured using a trypan blue exclusion assay. The methanol extract of the pulp part showed the least inhibition concentration of 15.40\u00b10.91 \u03bcg/mL on MCF-7 cells. In the study, the molecular mechanism of methanol extracts-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrested in human cancer cells were investigated in a time-dependent-manner by using flow cytometry. The treated cells were stained with nexin to detect early and late apoptosis and with propidium iodide (PI) for cell cycle arreste associated with the DNA fragmentation; various cell arrests occurred at G1/S, S, and G2/M phases. Lastly, the gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR method was carried out by analyzing the expression of the gene of interest for the quantification of mRNA levels.", "Results after cells were treated with IC50 were revealed by upregulating anti-apoptotic genes/downregulated of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 gene expressions triggered the treated cells into CASPASE- 3, intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.", "These findings suggest that the methanol extracts of three parts of A. altilis fruit have potential anticancer activity against MCF-7 cells mainly the pulp part of the fruit."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lebanese French University, Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Jalal", "ForeName": "Tara", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Faculty of Public Health and Health Informatics, Umm Qura Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Natto", "ForeName": "Hatim Abdullah", "Initials": "HA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Science, Kulliyyah of Allied Health Sciences, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuantan Campus, Pahang, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Wahab", "ForeName": "Ridhwan Abdul", "Initials": "RA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Comb Chem High Throughput Screen", "NlmUniqueID": "9810948", "ISSNLinking": "1386-2073"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 8"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Artocarpus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 8"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle Checkpoints"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "MCF-7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33653245", "10.2174/1386207324666210302095557", "CCHTS-EPUB-114654"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
