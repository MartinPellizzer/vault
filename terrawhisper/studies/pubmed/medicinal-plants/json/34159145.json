The ethanolic extracts of these plants obtained by Soxhlet extraction were analyzed by the developed high-performance liquid chromatography-diode-array detection method. Lupeol, the anti-inflammatory triterpene, was selected as a chemical marker for this investigation. All extracts together with that compound were further evaluated for their potential on anti-inflammatory activity using 5-lipoxygenase inhibition assay. Lupeol in each extract was quantified and expressed in the range of 21.44 \u00b1 0.89-40.72 \u00b1 0.40 mg per 100 g of crude drug and the enzyme inhibitory activity of all tested extracts presented as half-maximal inhibitory concentration values ranged between 63.71 \u00b1 2.09 and 91.09 \u00b1 1.40 \u03bcg/mL. This study shows that the developed analytical method is effective for analyzing triterpene lupeol in these plants and also reveals the relationship between a lupeol content and the anti-inflammatory effect."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2021 Journal of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology & Research."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Rangsit University, Pathum Thani, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Somwong", "ForeName": "Pathom", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, Rangsit University, Pathum Thani, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Theanphong", "ForeName": "Orawan", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Adv Pharm Technol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101537797", "ISSNLinking": "0976-2094"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Puttarak P, Sawangjit R, Chaiyakunapruk N.
