The people of the Khatra region of Bankura, West Bengal, India, use parts of various plants to treat and cure diarrhea. The region has a dense forest with a formidable number of medicinal plants which have been used by the local people for many years to treat illnesses. Ethanol extracts of Ficus bengalensis Linn., Eugenia jambolana Lam., Ficus racemosa Linn., and Leucas lavandulaefolia Rees from Khatra region were evaluated for anti-diarrheal activity against different experimental models of diarrhea in rats. The concoctions showed significant inhibitory activity against castor oil-induced diarrhea and PGE(2)-induced enteropooling in rats. The extracts also showed a significant reduction in gastrointestinal motility in charcoal meal tests in study subjects.
