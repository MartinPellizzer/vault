Likewise, Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (PI3K\u03b1) is also regarded as one of the most important targets in cancer therapy by mediating the cell growth and angiogenesis of various human cancers. In addition, Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) modulates oncogene expressions of Myc, Aurora kinase and various RTKs. Recently, accumulating evidences indicated that hyperactivated or abnormally expressed Aurora A, PI3K\u03b1 or BRD4 are closely associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Hence, simultaneous inhibition of Aurora A, PI3K\u03b1, and BRD4 is expected to be a new strategy for NSCLC therapy. In this study, we performed further structure optimization of 6-(2-amino-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-6-yl)-quinazolin-4(3H) -one based on previous study to obtain a series of derivatives for discovering potential Aurora A, PI3K\u03b1 and BRD4 multi-targeted inhibitors. MTT assay showed that most of the newly synthesized compounds exhibited an evident anticancer activity against the NSCLC cells. Among them, the IC<sub>50</sub> values of the most potent compound 9a were 0.83, 0.26 and 1.02\u00a0\u03bcM against A549, HCC827 and H1975 cells, respectively. In addition, 9a markedly inhibited the Aurora A and PI3K\u03b1 kinase activities with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 10.19\u00a0nM and 13.12\u00a0nM. Compound 9a induced G2/M phase arrests and apoptosis of HCC827 cells by simultaneous inhibition of Aurora A/PI3K/ BRD4 signaling pathways. Collectively, our studies suggested that 9a might be a potential multi-targeted inhibitor for NSCLC therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
