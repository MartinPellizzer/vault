Aconiti Radix is widely used for the treatment of rheumatism, which has significant anti-inflammatory effects. However, its anti-inflammatory mechanism on molecular level is still not clear. The purpose of this study is to illuminate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Aconiti Radix based on the protein interaction network (PIN) analysis on molecular network level. The main anti-inflammatory components (aconitine, hypaconitine and mesaconitine) were chosen in this study to obtain the targets of the components and protein-protein information though databases retrieval and construct the PIN of Aconiti Radix. By a graph theoretic clustering algorithm molecular complex detection(MCODE), 13 modules were identified and analyzed by gene ontology(GO) enrichment. The results showed that the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Aconiti Radix was mainly associated with prostanoid metabolic process and leukocyte chemotaxis mediated by chemokines. In this study, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Aconiti Radix was elucidated systematically from molecular network level, which provided the scientific basis for the treatment of rheumatic diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medical Information Engineering, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Shi-Chao", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medical Information Engineering, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Xiao-Ying", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medical Information Engineering, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ju", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medical Information Engineering, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Shu-Ting", "Initials": "ST"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medical Information Engineering, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Chuan-Biao", "Initials": "CB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aconitum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Interaction Maps"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29082700", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170121.031"]}}]}
