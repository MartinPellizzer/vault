(Caesalpiniaceae) is widely used from ancient period to treat diabetes mellitus. The leaves of Cassia auriculata are having potential in the development of drug for diabetes due to its antihyperglycemic and lipid-lowering activity.", "The present study was to evaluate antihyperglycemic and hypolipidemic activity of aqueous extract of Cassia auriculata leaves (CLEt) in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mild diabetic (MD) and severe diabetic (SD) rats.", "Male Albino rats were rendered diabetic by STZ (45 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). CLEt was orally administered to MD and SD rats at 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg doses for 1 day to determine antihyperglycemic activity. The 400 mg/kg dose was administered daily for 3 weeks to assess glycemic control and hypolipidemic effect.", "CLEt showed dose dependant fall in fasting blood glucose (FBG). After 5h of extract administration at 400mg/kg dose, FBG was reduced by 13.9% and 17.4% in MD and SD rats respectively. After 3 weeks treatment, CLEt produced significant reduction in FBG and glycosylated haemoglobin (GHb) in both MD and SD rats. Serum lipid levels were reversed towards normal in extract fed MD and SD rats.", "The results demonstrate that CLEt possesses potent antihyperglycemic and hypolipidemic activity in both MD and SD rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University College of Medical Sciences and GTB Hospital, Delhi 110095, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Shipra", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Suman Bala", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bansal", "ForeName": "Surendra Kumar", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prabhu", "ForeName": "Krishna Madhava", "Initials": "KM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycated Hemoglobin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cassia"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycated Hemoglobin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19473793", "10.1016/j.jep.2009.02.019", "S0378-8741(09)00087-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
