In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of green tea extract supplementation on sputum smear conversion and weight changes in smear positive pulmonary TB patients in Iran.", "In this double blind clinical study, TB patients were divided into intervention, (n=43) receiving 500 mg green tea extract (GTE), and control groups (n=40) receiving placebo for two months, using balanced randomization. Random allocation and allocation concealment were observed. Height and weight were measured at the beginning, and two and six months post-treatment. Evaluations were performed on three slides, using the ZiehlNeelsen method. Independent and paired t test, McNemar's, Wilcoxon, Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression model and Log-Rank test were utilized. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. This trial was registered under IRCT201212232602N11.", "The interventional changes and the interactive effect of intervention on weight were not significant (p>0.05). In terms of shortening the duration of conversion, the case to control proportion showed a significant difference (p=0.032). Based on the Cox regression model, the hazard ratio of the relative risk of delay in sputum smear conversion was 3.7 (p=0.002) in the higher microbial load group compared to the placebo group and 0.54 (95% CI: 0.31-0.94) in the intervention compared to the placebo group.", "GTE decreases the risk of delay in sputum smear conversion, but has no effect on weight gain. Moreover, it may be used as an adjuvant therapy for faster rehabilitation for pulmonary TB patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PhD Candidate, Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. honarvar@goums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Honarvar", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Professor, Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. segtesadi@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Eghtesadi", "ForeName": "Shahryar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Assistant Professor, Departments of PhysioPharmacology & NanoBioMedicine, Research Center for Immunogenetics, Faculty of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran. pooriagill@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Gill", "ForeName": "Pooria", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Associate Professor, Research Center for Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. sh_jaz@yahoo.com ."}], "LastName": "Jazayeri", "ForeName": "Shima", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Associate Professor, Health Management and Social Development Research Center, Department of Health and Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran. vakili@goums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Vakili", "ForeName": "Mohammad Ali", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Professor, Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. ardekani@sina.tums.ac.ir ."}], "LastName": "Shamsardekani", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Assistant Professor, Department of Infection, Faculty of Medicine, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran. abdolbas@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Abbasi", "ForeName": "Abdollah", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Med J Islam Repub Iran", "NlmUniqueID": "8910777", "ISSNLinking": "1016-1430"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "\nMinistry of Health and Medical Education of Iran.
