However, reports on other type of constituents and the potential application are lacking. In the present project, an intensive chemical fractionation on the aerial part extract of E. fortunei led to the isolation and identification of a series of fatty acid derivatives (lipids, 1a/1b-19) including seven pairs of previously undescribed enantiomers (1a/1b-7a/7b), as well as a lignan (brachangobinan A (BBA), 20) and two monoterpenes (8S/8R-9-hydroxythymol, 21a/21b). A preliminary biological evaluation of these compounds in a NO production inhibitory assay model demonstrated compound BBA as the most active one. Network pharmacology analysis was used to predict and explore the possible anti-inflammatory targets and mechanism of BBA, which revealed some potential inflammation-related proteins and signaling pathways. Further experimental investigations validated that the anti-inflammatory effect of BBA could be achieved by suppressing pro-inflammatory factors and blocking the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Taken together, our work shows that E. fortunei can serve as a potential resource of lipids and anti-inflammatory agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
