The demand for P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis as a raw material increases greatly and currently exceeds 1,000 tons per year (Zhou et al. 2021). In September 2021, root rot was observed on P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis in Mangshi, Yunnan province, China. Average disease incidences in the fields reached 15%, with diseased plants exhibiting yellowing and wilting leaves, as well as browning and rotting roots. Cross sections (5 \u00d7 5 mm2) cut from the margin of symptomatic and asymptomatic root tissues were surface-sterilized for 30 s with 75% ethanol, followed by 180 s with 1% sodium hypochlorite. After rinsing thrice with sterile distilled water, the fragments were transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates and incubated at 28\u00b0C in the dark. Ten isolates were obtained, and single spore isolation was performed. These isolates showed similar morphological characters, with colonies ranging in color from white to pale cream and sparse mycelia. Conidia were produced on the top or side of phialides. Microconidia were oval or reniform, 0- or 1-septate, with a diameter of 5.1-10.7 \u00b5m \u00d7 1.6-3.9 \u00b5m (average 7.6 \u03bcm \u00d7 2.8 \u00b5m) (n=30). The macroconidia were straight to slightly curved or sickle-shaped, 3- to 5-septate, with a diameter of 15.1-27.9 \u03bcm \u00d7 2.8-4.0 \u03bcm (average 21.0 \u03bcm \u00d7 3.6 \u03bcm). Chlamydospores were smooth, nearly round, and 3.3-6.6 (average 4.9) \u03bcm in diameter. Genomic DNA were extracted from mycelia of the two isolates. The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS), translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1\u03b1), and the second largest subunit of nuclear DNA-directed RNA polymerase II (RPB2) were amplified with the primer pairs of ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), EF1-728F/EF1-986R (Carbone and Kohn 1999), and fRPB2-5F/fRPB2-7cR (Liu et al. 1999), respectively. These two isolates exhibited the same nucleotide sequences (ITS, OP646781; EF1\u03b1, OP661172; RPB2, OP661173), with BLASTn analyses showing 100%, 99.66%, and 99.65% identity, respectively, with Fusarium solani (syn. Neocosmospora solani) (Crespo et al. 2019) strain NRRL 43474 (ITS, EF453097; EF1\u03b1, EF452945; RPB2, EF469984). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGAX based on the nucleotide sequences of ITS, EF1\u03b1, and RPB2, using the maximum likelihood method. The isolate was classified into the F. solani clade. According to the morphology and sequence analyses, the isolate was identified as F. solani (Chehri et al. 2015), and named PpFs1. To test the pathogenicity of the isolate PpFs1, the roots of four years old P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis plants were dipped in 107 spore/mL suspension filtered from potato dextrose broth (PDB) for 30 min, while control roots were dipped in sterile water. After inoculation, all plants were transplanted in pots filled with sterile soil and kept at 25\u00b0C with a 12/12-h light/darkness photoperiod. Six plants were used for each treatment, and repeated thrice. Two months after inoculation, the infected plants showed wilted leaves and rotted roots, while controls remained asymptomatic. PpFs1, identified by morphology and ITS, was re-isolated from infected plants, and was found to comply with Koch's postulates. To the best of our knowledge, F. oxysporum and F. concentricum causes Paris polyphylla var. Chinensis stem rot in China. But this is the first report of root rot on P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis being caused by F. solani in Yunnan, China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, College of Chinese Materia Medica, Kunming, Yunnan, China; 2419452108@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Jianyun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 177554, Kunming, Yunnan, China; 1483874909@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Jingying", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dehong Agricultural Technology Extension Center, Mangshi, China; 1115318327@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Junhua", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica and Yunnan Key Laboratory of Southern Medicinal Resource, Kunming, Yunnan, China; dongjhn@126.com."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Jia Hong", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming, Yunnan, China; 466192110@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Pengzhang", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 177554, Chenggong, Yuhua road No. 1076, Kunming, Yunnan, China, 650500; zhlei318@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Normal University, 66343, Kunming, Yunnan, China; chaixia@xtbg.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Chai", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37552162", "10.1094/PDIS-06-23-1217-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
