The fruit is used in various traditional medicinal applications. The study aimed to identify the compounds of the essential oil of the leaves obtained by hydrodistillation and in the fruit through Solid-Phase Microextraction by headspace mode (HS-SPME) coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The analysis of mature fruits led to the identification of 18 compounds, compared to the hydrodistillation, in which 21 compounds were identified. Benzaldehyde, linalool, and \u03b2-cyclocitral were identified in both methods. Linalool was the major compound in both processes. These findings highlight the importance of knowing the chemical composition of organic volatile compounds (VOCs), given the potential for medicinal applications and popular use of plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Integrated Sciences, University Campus of Aragua\u00edna, Federal University of Northern Tocantins, Aragua\u00edna, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Ferreira Almeida", "ForeName": "Nat\u00e1lia", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Integrated Sciences, University Campus of Aragua\u00edna, Federal University of Northern Tocantins, Aragua\u00edna, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Dos Santos Niculau", "ForeName": "Edenilson", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Integrated Sciences, University Campus of Aragua\u00edna, Federal University of Northern Tocantins, Aragua\u00edna, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Cordeiro Toledo Lima", "ForeName": "Pedro", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Integrated Sciences, University Campus of Aragua\u00edna, Federal University of Northern Tocantins, Aragua\u00edna, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Ferreira da Silva", "ForeName": "Wanderson", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38440938", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2325595"]}}]}
