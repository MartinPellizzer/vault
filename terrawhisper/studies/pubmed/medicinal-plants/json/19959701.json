One hundred thirty-five herbal cigarette smokers and 143 regular smokers from one city in China completed a questionnaire on smoking behavior and provided a urine sample. The main outcome measures were cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine in all samples, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites (PAH; 1-hydroxypyrene, naphthols, hydroxyfluorenes, and hydroxyphnanthrenes) and the tobacco specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-butanol (NNAL) and NNAL-glucuronide in randomly selected 98 samples (47 from the herbal smokers' group and 51 from the regular smokers' group). Values were normalized by creatinine to correct for possible variability introduced by dilution or concentration of the urine.", "Health concern was among the main reasons that smokers switched to herbal cigarettes from regular cigarettes. Smokers reported increased consumption after switching to herbal cigarettes from regular cigarettes. For all the four markers analyzed (cotinine, trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, total NNAL, and total PAHs), we observed no significant difference in the levels (P = 0.169, P = 0.146, P = 0.171, and P = 0.554, respectively) between smokers of herbal cigarettes and smokers of regular cigarettes. Both total NNAL and total PAHs were significantly correlated with cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine (P < 0.001 for all four correlations).", "Our findings showed that herbal cigarettes did not deliver less carcinogens than regular cigarettes. The public needs to be aware of this fact, and the Chinese tobacco industry should avoid misleading the public when promoting herbal cigarettes as safer products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, University of California, San Francisco, 94143-1390, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gan", "ForeName": "Quan", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Gonghuan", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goniewicz", "ForeName": "Maciej", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Benowitz", "ForeName": "Neal L", "Initials": "NL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Glantz", "ForeName": "Stanton A", "Initials": "SA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA-113710", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R25 CA113710", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R25 CA113710-03", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R25 CA113710-04", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "T32 CA113710", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R25 CA113710-02", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev", "NlmUniqueID": "9200608", "ISSNLinking": "1055-9965"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrosamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K5161X06LL", "NameOfSubstance": "Cotinine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Addictive"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Cotinine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrosamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflicts of Interest Statement:</b> Dr. Benowitz has served as a paid expert witness in litigation against tobacco companies on issues related to addiction and light cigarettes.
