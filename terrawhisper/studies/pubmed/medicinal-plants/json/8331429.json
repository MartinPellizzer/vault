Background information was given on the health care system in Mexico and midwives' provision of medical care. The interviews were based on visits in the fall of 1992. Health care systems in Mexico reflect diversity: large public health care institutions that provide care without cost to eligible persons with geographic accessibility, the private health care system of allopathic physicians and hospitals, and traditional medicine with several types of healers including 39% who were midwives (61% women). There are traditional midwives, the trained empirical midwife, and the \"untrained\" empirical empirical midwife, each of which is described. 2 other types of midwives were identified during the visit, foreign-trained midwives and nurse-midwives, who are referred to as \"nurse specialists licensed in obstetrics.\" Traditional health care practices can be found throughout all levels of society and health care. Several features of this system include the concept of hot-cold and \"naturaleza\" or inherent nature, which influences sexuality, family size, and physical, spiritual, and temperamental characteristics. Hydrotherapy is a common practice and includes 4 types of baths. Transdermal absorption of herbal infusions have been confirmed in modern scientific studies to effectively provide bacteriostatic, antiinflammatory, or other therapeutic qualities. The medicinal plants and animal substances are based on pre-Hispanic and European products and can be taken orally, or by douching or massage. Therapies combine the modern with the traditional. Interviews were conducted with a nurse-midwife working in a large public, university hospital and functioning as a hospital administrator, a nurse-midwife instructor in nursing, a midwife in a private clinic and feminist birthing center, a foreign-trained midwife, and a traditional practicing midwife with 37 years of experience. Current policy is attempting to respectfully integrate traditional healers within the medical system, and allowing them more autonomy. There is a recommendation that specific regions have special needs and strategies should be devised regionally rather than nationally."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["091514", "00227759"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: JOURNAL OF NURSE-MIDWIFERY."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Americas", "Critique", "Data Collection", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Health", "Health Personnel", "Interviews", "Latin America", "Mexico", "Midwives", "North America", "Nurse-midwives", "Research Methodology"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "8331429", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1993", "Month": "08", "Day": "19"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "23"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0091-2182", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "38", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1993", "Season": "May-Jun"}}, "Title": "Journal of nurse-midwifery", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Nurse Midwifery"}, "ArticleTitle": "Interviews with Mexican midwives.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "170", "EndPage": "177", "MedlinePgn": "170-7"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Mexican society contains a variety of indigenous cultures as well as European influences.
