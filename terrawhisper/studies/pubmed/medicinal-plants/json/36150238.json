Therefore, the efficacy and safety of NS oil in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis were evaluated.", "One hundred and sixteen patients aged 50-70 years were randomly assigned to take 2.5\u00a0mL NS oil (N\u00a0=\u00a058) or placebo (N\u00a0=\u00a058) orally every 8\u00a0h for 1 month. WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) was the primary outcome measure and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, number of 500\u00a0mg acetaminophen tablets taken per day during the trial, patients' satisfaction with the interventions, complete blood count and the blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were the secondary outcome measures.", "Fifty two and 54 patients respectively in the NS oil and placebo groups completed the study. The VAS scores were decreased by 33.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.04% (NS oil group) and 9.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32% (placebo group) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and WOMAC total scores were decreased by 27.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.61% (NS oil group) and 1.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.31% (placebo group) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) compared to baseline. The NS oil reduced the dose of acetaminophen significantly compared with the placebo (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001).
