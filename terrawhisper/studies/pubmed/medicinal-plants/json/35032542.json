No pesticide residue was determined in more than 91% of examined samples. However, the dimethoate residue was detected in 3 raw milk samples in levels higher than EU recommended MRL. While in 3 human milk samples, organochlorine pesticides residue, p,p'-DDT, and p,p'-DDD was recognized below MRLs, only in 1 human sample residue of p,p'-DDE was more than CODEX recommended MRL. HI in adults and children were 0.72 and 3.55, respectively. However, the health risk assessment based on HI demonstrated that adult consumers are not at considerable risk. The HI, higher than 1 in children, confirms the risks raised due to ingestion of organochlorine (OCP) and organophosphorus (OPP) pesticides via milk consumption. In addition, no carcinogenic risk to milk consumers was calculated. Therefore, implementation of good farming practices on farms, improving the knowledge and consciousness of pesticide users, use other safe methods for pest control such as biotechnology-based, and use a rational program for application of pesticides, continuous monitoring of pesticides in crops, and strict government regulations on pesticide residues in food are recommended."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
