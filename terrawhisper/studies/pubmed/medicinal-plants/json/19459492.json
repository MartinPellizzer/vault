The activities of the Mg2+-adenosine triphosphatase (Mg2+-ATPase), cholinesterase (ChE), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in the head-foot muscles, centric ganglions, gills and liver of Oncomelania hupensis were analyzed using enzyme histochemistry technology and changes were observed under a light microscope. Statistical quantitative analysis of data of grey values was conducted on the computer-assisted image analyzing system (HPIAS-1000).", "The color of stained ChE in the head-foot muscles, centric ganglions and gills of the snail lightened evidently, showing a decrease of ChE activity after snails were immersed in the extract of A. philoxeroides for 12 h or 20 h. Results of grey values at different stained parts of snail, measured by the computer-assisted image analyzing system, indicated that there was a significant difference (P<0.01) between the activities of ChE in the head-foot muscles (130.95 +/- 8.08, 129.91 +/- 7.05), centric ganglions (127.43 +/- 7.27, 126.78 +/- 7.38) and gills (121.38 +/- 7.31, 126.41 +/- 8.28) from snails exposed to aqueous extract of A. philoxeroides for 12 h and 20 h and the activities of the enzyme in counter-parts (64.65 +/- 8.54, 65.18 +/- 7.96, 57.86 +/- 6.57, 50.71 +/- 6.15, 88.96 +/- 6.78 and 89.86 +/- 7.01, respectively) from control group. The activities of Mg2+-ATPase also showed a significant difference (P<0.05) in the head-foot muscles (89.91 +/- 5.08), centric ganglions (71.15 +/- 5.43) and liver (112.40 +/- 7.81) of the snail after 20 h of exposure against those in counter-parts (78.81 +/- 8.10, 60.09 +/- 6.05 and 95.50 +/- 8.35, respectively) from the control, but no significant difference (P>0.05) was shown on the activities of Mg2+-ATPase between the snails exposed for 12 h in extract of A. philoxeroides and those of control.
