These two commercially available oils have been examined separately by means of GC-MS. The oil constituents were identified according to their mass spectra and their relative retention indices determined on both polar and non-polar stationary phase capillary columns. A total of 55 compounds have been identified constituting 76.7% (bark) and 91.6% (leaves) of the volatile constituents. Both oils were found to have a similar composition; however the relative percentages of some compounds notably differed. The bark essential oil contained beta-pinene (17.1%), cis-sesquisabinene hydrate (12.8%) and caryophyllene oxide (7.0%) as the main components whereas the leaf essential oil was largely dominated by trans-beta-farnesene (35.6%); beta-pinene (12.8%), cis-sesquisabinene hydrate (9.8%) and ar-curcumene (8.6%) were also present as major components. As far as we know, this is the first report on the Cedrelopsis grevei bark and leaf essential oils which therapeutic properties may be attractive for aromatherapy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Chimie des Substances Naturelles et des Sciences des Aliments, Facult\u00e9 des Sciences et Technologies, Universit\u00e9 de la Reunion, 15 Avenue Ren\u00e9 Cassin, B.P. 7151, 97 715 Saint Denis Messag Cedex 9, DOM, France. gauvin@univ-reunion.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gauvin", "ForeName": "Anne", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ravaomanarivo", "ForeName": "Harimisa", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smadja", "ForeName": "Jacqueline", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Bark"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15032374", "10.1016/j.chroma.2003.12.012", "S0021-9673(03)02266-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
