Most members of the family are ornamental and form part of specialist succulent collections. The exceptional diversity of the Aizoaceae is not only limited to its growth forms, habitat, and chemistry, but is also reflected in its many traditional uses. Selected species are well known for their use in traditional medicines, with recent scientific studies validating their biological activity.", "Herein, this review aimed to articulate foundational and current global research endeavors related to the traditional uses and pharmacological activities of the Aizoaceae.", "Research articles and search terms related to the ethnopharmacology and bioactivities of the Aizoaceae between 1940 and 2022 were evaluated using electronic databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, JSTOR, and Web of Science.", "Popular Aizoaceae genera including Mesembryanthemum, Trianthema, and Tetragonia are noted for their cultural value and are key components in herbal medicines for the treatment of a myriad of disorders. Isolated bioactive compounds isolated from selected species demonstrated varied antimicrobial, antioxidant, and neuroprotective functions in basic pharmacological studies. However, most studies lacked reliable correlation to in vivo activity and did not adequately validate the safety and efficacy of potential therapeutic compounds.", "While the cultural and therapeutic value of popular Aizoaceae species have been highlighted in the literature, there remains glaring inconsistencies among other related species. Data deficiency may be ameliorated by further studies focused on taxonomic markers, chemical characterization and underlying molecular mechanisms of activity of a wider pool of species to enhance our knowledge of this hyperdiverse family."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
