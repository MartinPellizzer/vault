Prolonged use of analgesics is often associated with increased adverse events. Juan Bi Tang (JBT) is an ancient decoction of Chinese traditional medicinal plants commonly used to treat spasms and pain in the shoulder and upper arm, and it is popularly believed to have favorable outcomes in Asian populations. This interventional prospective pilot study was worked to demonstrate the potential of JBT for fistula-associated myofascial pain in HD patients and to prepare for future randomized controlled trials. Eligible patients were enrolled in this study and took JBT to treat fistula-associated myofascial pain for 4 weeks. Pain scores on a visual analogue scale (VAS) were reported at baseline, after a 4-week intervention, and 2 weeks after completion of treatment. The Kidney Disease Quality of Life 36-Item Short Form and a safety laboratory monitor were statistically compared between different time points. A total of 20 patients were selected as eligible participants and completed the intervention and questionnaires. The mean VAS score was significantly reduced after JBT treatment (P\u2005<\u2005.01). Participants reported improved physical (P\u2005<\u2005.01) and mental health (P\u2005<\u2005.05) after treatment. However, only improvements in mental health were preserved 2 weeks after the end of treatment (P\u2005<\u2005.05). In this study, complementary JBT for HD patients with fistula-related myofascial pain was viable and well tolerated, and it demonstrated the expected effects on pain control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 the Author(s).
