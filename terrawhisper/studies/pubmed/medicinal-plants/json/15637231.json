The increasing need for plant-derived high quality drugs cannot be provided by their collection in the wilderness. METHOD A: To preserve the genome of Szabadkigyo. wild type having high (-)-alpha-bisabolol content, we used biotechnological methods.", "The roots of organized culture contained beta-eudesmol, which we have identified in the intact roots. Our gas-chromatographic and mass-spectroscopic studies showed that sterile chamomile cultures generated the most important terpenoid and polyin compounds characteristics of the intact plant. We identified berkheyaradulene, geranyl-isovalerate and cedrol, as new components in these cultures. Magnesium (Mg) (370 and 740 mg/l MgSO4) has a positive effect on the growth of organized cultures and also on the quality and quantity of essential oil production. METHOD B: Another possible source of variants is available by the genetic transformation of organized cultures by infection with Agrobacterium rhisogenes. With this method, we cultivated chamomile infected by A4-Y clone and investigated the essential oil production by hairy root cultures cultivated on solid and liquid MS B-5 media. The main component of the essential oil of hairy root cultures was trans-beta-farnesene.", "We identified alpha-selinene, as a new component in these hairy roots. We studied the growth rate of A4-Y clone on the cited media, containing MgSO4 concentrations: 0; 185; 370 and 740 mg/l. The cultures grew most in medium containing 740 mg/l of MgSO4. Essential oil content was compared from hairy root cultures of different Mg containing media and measured by GC and GC-MS methods. Mg has a similar effect on hairy roots as on organized cultures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Semmelweis University, H-1085 Budapest Ull\u00f6i str. 26., Hungary. szokee@drog.sote.hu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sz\u00f6ke", "ForeName": "Eva", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00e1day", "ForeName": "Em\u00f6ke", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kiss", "ForeName": "Sandor A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sonnewend", "ForeName": "Lara", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lemberkovics", "ForeName": "Eva", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Coll Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8215879", "ISSNLinking": "0731-5724"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7487-88-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium Sulfate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I38ZP9992A", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Chamomile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium Sulfate"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15637231", "10.1080/07315724.2004.10719425", "23/6/763S"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
