Hybrids between indica and japonica rice varieties have strong heterosis, but the parental lines usually have different, nonoverlapping DFOTs. This reduces the success of hybrid seed production in crosses between indica and japonica subspecies, thus hindering the utilization of indica and japonica inter-subspecies heterosis. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating DFOT in rice. Here, we obtained japonica rice lines with a DFOT 1.5\u2009h earlier than the wild type by overexpressing OsMYC2, a gene encoding a key transcription factor in the jasmonate (JA) signaling pathway. OsMYC2 is activated by JA signaling and directly regulates the transcription of genes related to JA biosynthesis and cell wall metabolism. Overexpressing OsMYC2 led to significantly increased JA contents and decreased cellulose and hemicellulose contents in lodicule cells, as well as the softening of lodicule cell walls. This may facilitate the swelling of lodicules, resulting in early diurnal flower-opening. These results suggest that the OsMYC2-JA feedback loop regulates DFOT in rice via cell wall remodeling. These findings shed light on the understanding of regulatory mechanism of the DFOT of plants, which should promote the development of indica and japonica varieties suitable for hybrid rice breeding."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation":
