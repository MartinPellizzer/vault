Dysfunction of RIO kinases have been implicated in malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia, glioma, breast, colorectal, lung and prostatic adenocarcinoma suggesting RIO kinases as potential targets in cancer. In vitro, in vivo and clinical studies have demonstrated that RIO kinases are overexpressed in various types of cancers suggesting important roles in tumorigenesis, especially in metastasis. In the context of malignancies, RIO kinases are involved in cancer-promoting pathways including AKT/mTOR, RAS, p53 and NF-\u03baB and cell cycle regulation. Here we review the role of RIO kinases in cancer development emphasizing their potential as therapeutic target and encouraging further development and investigation of inhibitors in the context of cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
