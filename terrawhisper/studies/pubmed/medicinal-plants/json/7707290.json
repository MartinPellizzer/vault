A group of 12 ewes was used as a control and not fed the supplement. Plasma concentrations of LH and GH (20 min intervals) and FSH, insulin and prolactin (hourly intervals) were determined in plasma samples collected every 20 min over 24 h on day 11 of the oestrous cycle. The changes were related to increases in ovulation rate. Ovulation rate was increased (2.5 +/- 0.2 versus 1.9 +/- 0.2 for lupin-supplemented and control groups, respectively; P = 0.073) in the group that received the lupin supplement, but this increase was not associated with significant changes in either LH or FSH concentrations on day 11 of the oestrous cycle. Lupin supplementation had significant effects on the plasma concentrations of prolactin, GH and insulin. There was a transient increase (P < 0.05) in the concentration of prolactin 4-8 h after feeding, whereas insulin concentrations were increased immediately after feeding (P < 0.02) and were still high 24 h later (P < 0.02). Growth hormone concentrations were reduced in ewes fed with lupin grain (P < 0.001). These metabolic responses initiated by feeding a high energy and protein supplement such as lupin grain may be related to changes in ovulation rate. In particular, the sustained increases in insulin concentrations suggest that an increased supply of glucose to the follicle mediates nutritionally stimulated increases in ovulation rate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIRO Division of Animal Production, Blacktown, NSW, Australia."}], "LastName": "Downing", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Joss", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Connell", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Scaramuzzi", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Reprod Fertil", "NlmUniqueID": "0376367", "ISSNLinking": "0022-4251"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hormones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-62-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Prolactin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-67-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Luteinizing Hormone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-68-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Follicle Stimulating Hormone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-72-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Growth Hormone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Follicle Stimulating Hormone"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Growth Hormone"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Hormones"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Luteinizing Hormone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ovulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Prolactin"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7707290", "10.1530/jrf.0.1030137"]}}]}
