In total, 20 soils from nine locations were examined; metal contents and physicochemical soil parameters were measured with standard methods. In general, a pronounced induction of the frequency of micronuclei (MN) in the Tradescantia micronucleus (Trad-MN) assay was seen with increasing metal concentration in soils from identical locations. However, no correlations were found between metal contents and genotoxicity of soils from different locations. These discrepancies are probably due to differences of the physicochemical characteristics of the samples. Also, the microbial parameters depended on the metal content in soils from identical sampling locations. Inconsistent responses of the individual enzymes were seen in soils from different locations, indicating that it is not possible to define a specific marker enzyme for metal contamination. The most sensitive microbial parameters were dehydrogenase and arylsulfatase activity, biomass C, and biomass N. Statistical analyses showed an overall correlation between genotoxicity in Tradescantia on the one hand and dehydrogenase activity, biomass C, and the metabolic quotient on the other hand. In conclusion, the results of the present study show that the Trad-MN assay is suitable for the detection of genotoxic effects of metal contamination in soils and furthermore, that the DNA-damaging potential of soils from different origin cannot be predicted on the basis of chemical analyses of their metal concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Cancer Research, University of Vienna, Borschkegasse 8a, A-1090, Vienna, Austria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Majer", "ForeName": "Bernhard J", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tscherko", "ForeName": "Dagmar", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paschke", "ForeName": "Albrecht", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wennrich", "ForeName": "Rainer", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kundi", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kandeler", "ForeName": "Ellen", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Knasm\u00fcller", "ForeName": "Siegfried", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.6.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Arylsulfatases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arylsulfatases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Micronucleus Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11909759", "10.1016/s1383-5718(02)00004-9", "S1383571802000049"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
