These results, together with the planar aromatic character of the furanonaphthoquinones, suggested that they might be acting as DNA intercalators. In an attempt to improve this activity, various analogues containing a hydroxyamino side chain have been synthesized. The analogues were prepared by standard methods, but some unexpected reactions were observed nonetheless. Thus, 8-formyl-5-methoxy-4,9-dihydronaphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-dione (24) showed an unusual reactivity toward reductive amination, with the reaction proceeding further to give one of two different cyclized products, depending on the amination reagent used. Bioassay results indicated that only simple furanonaphthoquines showed activity in a yeast assay for DNA-damaging agents; compounds with a substituted hydroxyamino side chain were uniformly inactive in this assay. Most of the compounds with a substituted hydroxyamino side chain on the furan ring did, however, show cytotoxicity, although none of them was any more active than the simple aldehyde 2-formyl-4, 9-dihydronaphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-dione (14). This evidence tends to suggest that the furanonaphthoquinones do not serve primarily as DNA intercalators, because if this were the case, they would have been expected to show an increased activity on conversion to their hydroxyamino side chain derivatives."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia 24061-0212, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "R K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mattern", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kingston", "ForeName": "D G", "Initials": "DG"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "1U01 CA 50771", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthoquinones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10425117", "10.1021/np9900019", "np9900019"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
