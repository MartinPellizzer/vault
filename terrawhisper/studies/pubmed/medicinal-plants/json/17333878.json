A great lover of nature, Orzeszkowa appreciated the botanical knowledge of the local rural population in the vicinities of Grodno. She combined attempts to master that knowledge with her other great passion, that of investigating folk culture, and was always ready to listen to what women who were village herbalists had to tell her about medicinal plants, and about the customs and legends connected with the medical practices based on herbal remedies. She then passed on the information to botanists for scientific verification. Orzeszkowa's naturalist and ethnographic fascinations led her to write a cycle of articles on \"The people and flowers on the Niemen river\", published in 1888-1891 in the ethnographic-tourist magazine \"Wis\u0142a\". This collection of articles has been analysed not only by historians of literature, but also, since 1985, by historians of science. The first analysis was conducted at the Section for the History of Pharmacy of the Institute of the History of Science of the Polish Academy of Sciences. This yielded Ewa Kami\u0144ska's study: Zio\u0142oznawstwo i zio\u0142olecznictwo w publikacjach etnograficznych Elizy Orzeszkowej [The knowledge of herbs and medicine based on herbal remedies in the ethnographic publications of Eliza Orzeszkowa] published as part of the Institute's Historia lek\u00f3w naturalnych [History of natural medicines], ed. Barbara Ku\u017anicka, vol. I: Zr\u00f3d\u0142a do dziej\u00f3w etnofarmacji polskiej [Sources for the history of Polish ethnopharmacy], Warszawa 1996, pp.25-88. The subject-matter of the publication aroused much interest among historians of pharmacy from Pozna\u0144. The first sign of that interest could be seen in the article by Jan Majewski and S\u0142awoj Kucharski entitled Pasje pisarki [The writer's passions], published in 1998 in \"Gazeta Farmaceutyczna\" [Pharmaceutical Journal] and illustrated with pages from the herbal created by Orzeszkowa. One of the authors, Jan Majewski, has found also other herbal-albums, kept, among other places, at the Museum of the Marist Fathers near London, and in the archival collections of the Ossolineum publishing house. A major surprise was connected with the discovery of a herbal that had the features of genuine botanical documentation. The title page of the herbal, which was discovered (by Jan Majewski and S\u0142awoj Kucharski ) at Pozna\u0144, in the collections of the Pozna\u0144 Society of the Friends of Science, carries the inscription: Zielnik Elizy Orzeszkowej. Z p\u00f3l, lak i las\u00f3w, nadnieme\u0144skich miejscowo\u015bci, Miniewicze, Ponizany, Hledowicze, Kowsz\u00f3w, Poniemu\u0144, Horny, Ko\u0142paki [The Herbal of Eliza Orzeszkowa. From the fields, meadows and woods of localities on the Niemen river, Miniewicze, Ponizany, Hledowicze, Kowsz\u00f3w, Poniemu\u0144, Horny, Ko\u0142paki]. The value of the herbal for the history of botany has been appreciated by Anna Maria Kielak, the author of a beautiful bibliophile publication entitled Zielnik Elizy Orzeszkowej nieznany zabytek botaniczny przechowywany w zbiorach Pozna\u0144skiego Towarzystwa Przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 Nauk. [The herbal of Eliza Orzeszkowa. An unknown botanical aabytek kept in the collections of the Pozna\u0144 Society of the Friends of Science], Pozna\u0144 2004, pp. 151. The author has presented Eliza Orzeszkowa's biography, as well as her botanical and ethnographic passions. She has also made a list of the plants mentioned in the herbal, as well as appendices containing Orzeszkowa's correspondence with botanists. The author also describes the artistic albums composed by Orzeszkowa from dried herbs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instytut Historii Nauki PAN, Warszawa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ku\u017anicka", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Biography", "English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Zielniki i albumy florystyczne Elizy Orzeszkowej."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Kwart Hist Nauki Tech", "NlmUniqueID": "0065346", "ISSNLinking": "0023-589X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}], "PersonalNameSubjectList": [{"LastName": "orzeszkowa", "ForeName": "Eliza", "Initials": "E"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17333878"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
