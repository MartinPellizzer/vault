During the last decade, there have been an increasing numbers of cases of fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, coupled with an increase in the number of incidences of drug resistance and toxicity to anti fungal agents. Hence, there is a dire need for safe, potent and affordable new antifungal drugs for the efficient management of candidal infections with minimum or no side effects.", "Candidiasis represents a critical problem to human health and a serious concern worldwide. Due to the development of drug resistance, there is a need for new antifungal agents. Therefore, we reviewed the different medicinal plants as sources of novel anticandidal drugs.", "The comprehensive and detailed literature on medicinal plants was carried out using different databases, such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct and all the relevant information from the articles were analyzed and included.", "Relevant Publications up to the end of November 2018, reporting anticandidal activity of medicinal plants has been included in the present review. In the present study, we have reviewed in the light of SAR and mechanisms of action of those plants whose extracts or phytomolecules are active against candida strains.", "This article reviewed natural anticandidal drugs of plant origin and also summarized the potent antifungal bioactivity against fungal strains. Besides, mechanism of action of these potent active plant molecules was also explored for a comparative study.
