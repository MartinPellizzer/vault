In this context, the use of antibiotics is very usual. Thus, looking for natural substance able to reduce the use of the antibiotics is imperative. Among them, there is a great interest at present in the study of medicinal plants such as guava (Psidium guajava L.). These plants could help to develop a more sustainable aquaculture all over the world. The application of guava in traditional medicine dates for centuries and it is widely used in tropical countries for the treatment of diseases in human and animals.", "The purpose of this work was to study the effects of the dietary administration of dried leaves of Psidium guajava on the skin mucosal immunity of hybrid tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0O. mossambicus). Furthermore, the ability of this plant to inhibit the bacterial load in different tissues after an experimental infection with Vibrio harveyi was studied.", "P. guajava leaves collection and the experimentation was carried out in Dominican Republic. Fish were fed with a commercial diet supplemented with guava leaf at different concentrations (0%, 1.5% and 3%) for 21 days before being intraperitoneally injected with V. harveyi (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>4</sup>\u00a0cells mL<sup>-1</sup>). Thereafter, several immune activities were measured in fish skin mucus and after 48\u00a0h of injection, the skin, spleen and liver were collected to analyse the bactericidal activity of guava leaf and the gene expression of some immune related genes.", "The administration of P. guajava leaves significantly modulated some immune-related enzymes (protease, antiprotease and peroxidase) in the skin mucus of hybrid tilapia. In addition, the bacterial load after V. harveyi infection in skin, spleen and liver significantly reduced in fish supplemented with guava leaves. Finally, the expression profile of hepcidin gene in skin and liver was modulated in fish feed with control diet after V. harveyi infection.", "These results demonstrate that the dietary intake of guava leaves increases the skin mucosal barrier defences of hybrid tilapia and confers protection against V. harveyi colonization."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
