Thirteen normo-cholesterolaemic male students consumed one 450 g can of baked beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) in tomato sauce, daily, for 14 d as part of their normal diet. After a 14 d washout period, eleven of the students went on to consume one 440 g can of spaghetti in tomato sauce, daily, for 14 d. 2. Fasting blood samples were taken frequently for measurement of plasma cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triacylglycerols, glucose, insulin and C-peptide. Diet diaries (3 d) were completed by the subjects during each period. 3. Consumption of beans and spaghetti led to a significant reduction in the amount of fat eaten daily (P less than 0.05). Bean consumption also resulted in significant increases in protein, fibre and sugar intakes (P less than 0.02, P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.05 respectively). 4. During the bean-eating period the mean total plasma cholesterol level of the students fell significantly from 5.1 to 4.5 mmol/l (P less than 0.02). No reduction in plasma cholesterol occurred during the spaghetti-eating period. 5. HDL-cholesterol levels fell significantly during both periods (P less than 0.001), but HDL:total cholesterol ratio was significantly reduced only during the spaghetti-eating period (P less than 0.001). Neither beans nor spaghetti affected triacylglycerol, insulin or C-peptide levels. 6. The benefits of a legume-rich diet are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pig Department, AFRC Institute for Grassland and Animal Production, Shinfield, Reading, Berks."}], "LastName": "Shutler", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bircher", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tredger", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Morgan", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Walker", "ForeName": "A F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Low", "ForeName": "A G", "Initials": "AG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0372547", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "C-Peptide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "C-Peptide"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2650733", "10.1079/bjn19890114", "S0007114589000334"]}}]}
