To investigate chemoprevention in an animal carcinogenesis model, we examined inhibitory effects of the lemon grass extract on the formation of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced DNA adducts and aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the rat colon. One week after the start of the treatment with lemon grass extract at doses of 0.5 or 5 g/kg body wt by gavage, F344 rats received two s.c. injections of 15 mg of AOM per kg body weight at 1 week apart. For DNA adduct analysis of the colon and liver, the rats were killed 12 h after the second AOM injection. The DNA from the liver and colon were used for O6-methylguanine and N7-methylguanine analysis. For ACF analysis in the initiation stage, AOM-injected rats were continuously treated with lemon grass extract and were killed 3 weeks after the second AOM injection. For analysis in the promotion stage the treatment with the lemon grass extract (0.5 g/kg) started 2 weeks after the second AOM injection and continued for 12 weeks until the animals were killed. Lemon grass treatment significantly inhibited DNA adduct formation in both the colonic mucosa and the muscular layer but not in the liver. In addition, lemon grass extract treatment significantly inhibited ACF formation in both the initiation stage and the promotion stage. Especially in the promotion stage, lemon grass treatment inhibited the formation of larger ACF (with four or more crypts per focus), which was predictive of tumor incidence. Furthermore, lemon grass extract inhibited fecal beta-glucuronidase competitively and had antioxidant activity. These results suggest that the lemon grass extract inhibits the release of activated aglycon, methylazoxymethanol, from a glucuronide conjugate in the colon, and decreases the DNA adducts and ACF formation in the rat colon."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bacteriology, School of Medicine, The University of Tokushima, Kuramoto-cho, Japan."}], "LastName": "Suaeyun", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kinouchi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Arimochi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vinitketkumnuen", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ohnishi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Carcinogenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8008055", "ISSNLinking": "0143-3334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Adducts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.31", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucuronidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MO0N1J0SEN", "NameOfSubstance": "Azoxymethane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Azoxymethane"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Colon"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Colorectal Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Adducts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucuronidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9163680", "10.1093/carcin/18.5.949"]}}]}
