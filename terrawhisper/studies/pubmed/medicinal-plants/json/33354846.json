Specifically, air-dried Artemisia princeps Pamp. cv. ssajuari (ssajuari-ssuk; Korean mugwort) has been used as moxa in moxibustion therapy. Thus, the evaluation of high quality ssajuari-ssuk containing herbal volatiles is of great interest in clinical therapy and the food industry.", "The aim of this study is to determine whether fast gas chromatography with uncoated surface acoustic wave (fast GC/SAW) sensor can be a useful technique for performing quality control using herbal volatiles of ssajuari-ssuk air-dried for different times.", "Fast GC/SAW sensor, called \"Electronic zNose\", is also a headspace sampling method and is an effective simple analytical method with a second unit analysis providing on-line measurements without the need for pretreatment of the sample.
