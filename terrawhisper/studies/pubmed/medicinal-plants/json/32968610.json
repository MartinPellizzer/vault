Nanomaterials can contribute to food safety by forming new nano-sized ingredients with modified physicochemical characteristics. Nanotechnologies can inhibit the growth of food spoilage microorganisms by recruiting novel and unique agents that are involved in removal of microbes from foods or prevent adhesion of microbial cells to food surfaces. Hence, nanotechnology could be considered as a high-potential tool in food packaging, safety, and preservation. Moreover, the prevention of biofilm formation by disturbing the attachment of bacteria to the food surface is another useful nanotechnological approach. Recently, nanoparticle-based biosensors have been designed and developed to detect the food-borne pathogens and hazardous substances through complicated mechanisms. During the past half-century, many methods such as freeze-drying and spray drying have been employed for increasing the viability in food industries; however, the other novel approaches such as encapsulation methods have also been developed. Admittedly, some beneficial bacteria such as probiotics bring diverse benefits for human health if only they are in a sufficient number and viability in the food products and gastrointestinal tract (GI). Encapsulation of these valuable microbial strains by nanoparticles improves the survival of probiotics under harsh conditions such as extreme levels of temperature, pH, and salinity during the processing of food products and within the GIT tract. The survival and effectiveness of encapsulated microorganisms depends on different factors including function of cell wall components in bacteria and type of coating materials. This review aims to broadly explore the potential of different aspects of nanotechnology in food industry, especially for packaging, preservation, safety, and viability."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2020."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.472325.5", "0000 0004 0493 9058"], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Islamic Azad University, Qom Branch, Qom, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rahmati", "ForeName": "Farzad", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411463.5", "0000 0001 0706 2472"], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Seyyedeh Sanaz", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411463.5", "0000 0001 0706 2472"], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahuti Safai", "ForeName": "Sadaf", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.412888.f", "0000 0001 2174 8913"], "Affiliation": "Health and Environmental Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Science, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Asgari Lajayer", "ForeName": "Behnam", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7873-144X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411425.7", "0000 0004 0417 7516"], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Arak University, Arak, 38156-8-8349 Iran."}], "LastName": "Hatami", "ForeName": "Mehrnaz", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "3 Biotech", "NlmUniqueID": "101565857", "ISSNLinking": "2190-5738"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict of interestThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Aabdallah M, Bayoumy A, Ibrahim A.
