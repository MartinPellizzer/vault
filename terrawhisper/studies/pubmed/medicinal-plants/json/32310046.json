It is a tropical or subtropical fruit and is a potent source of polyphenolic contents. In traditional medicines, mango peel extract has been commonly used, either singly or in combination with other plant extracts against different ailments since ancient times.", "An electronic database search for accepted articles in Pubmed, Google Scholar, Researchgate, Google, Scopus and Science Direct was used to review the scientific inputs by searching appropriate keywords. Some information was obtained from books and databases on medicinal plants used in different periods.", "Numerous reports revealed that mango peel contains a wide spectrum of phytochemical compounds like polyphenolics and flavonoids. A mango peel is a potential source of antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antidiabetic, antibacterial and antiproliferative properties. This review suggests that mango peel could be a potential drug to treat various clinical conditions in the future.", "In this review, a number of phytochemicals have been summarized for their pharmacological properties and the mechanisms of action, and the possible potential therapeutic applications of mango peel against various diseases are also discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati -517 502, India."}], "LastName": "Umamahesh", "ForeName": "Katike", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Nano and Energy Biosciences Laboratory, Thiruvalluvar University, Serkkadu, Vellore, Tamil Nadu - 632115, India."}], "LastName": "Gandhi", "ForeName": "Arumugam D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati -517 502, India."}], "LastName": "Reddy", "ForeName": "Obulam V S", "Initials": "OVS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mangifera"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32310046", "10.2174/1389201021666200420075759", "CPB-EPUB-105904"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
