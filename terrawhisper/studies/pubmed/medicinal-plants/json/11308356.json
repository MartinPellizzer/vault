People say that halitosis disappears during betel quid chewing. In this study, the removal of mouth odor during betel quid chewing was discussed by using a model system which measured its inhibition on the volatility of methyl mercaptan. Results showed that crude extracts of betel quid (the mixture of areca fruit, Piper betle, and slaked lime paste) and extracts of the mixture of areca fruit and slaked lime paste exhibited marked effects on the volatility of methyl mercaptan, and the inhibition function increased when increasing amounts of slaked lime paste were added. The same condition (increased inhibition) was also found by replacing the slaked lime paste with alkaline salts (calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or sodium hydroxide). Areca fruit, the major ingredient of betel quid, contained abundant phenolics. However, the crude phenolic extract of areca fruit did not show any inhibitory activity on the volatility of methyl mercaptan. Great inhibitory activity occurred only when the crude phenolic extract of areca fruit was treated with alkali. Further studies by using gel filtration determined that the effect probably came from the oxidative polymerization of phenolics of areca fruit after alkaline treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Nutritional Science, Chung Shan Medical and Dental College, 110, Section 1, Chien-Kuo North Road, Taichung, Taiwan, Republic of China. wck@mercury-csmc.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "C K", "Initials": "CK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "S L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11308356", "10.1021/jf000433l", "jf000433l"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
