In recent years, many chemotherapeutic supplements have been formulated by copper nanoparticles. In the present study, copper nanoparticles were prepared and synthesized in aqueous medium using Camellia sinensis leaf extract. The as-prepared Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanoparticles was thoroughly characterized using XRD, FT-IR, FESEM, EDX, TEM and X-ray elemental mapping techniques. The as-synthesized Cu<sub>2</sub>O/C. sinensis NPs applied as novel nanocatalyst for the synthesis of annulated fused pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidinones via a one-pot, three-component condensation of a barbituric acid, aromatic aldehydes, and malonitrile or ethylcyanoacetate under mild condition at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Main properties of this facile method are the involves an easy work-up procedure, avoidance of hazardous or polluting chemicals, significant yields under mild conditions, and one-pot reaction. We assessed the anti-human ovarian cancer potentials of these nanoparticles against Caov-3, SW-626, and SK-OV-3 cell lines. For investigating the antioxidant activities of CuCl<sub>2</sub>\u22c52H<sub>2</sub>O, C. sinensis, and copper nanoparticles, the DPPH free radical test was used. For the determining of anti-human ovarian cancer properties of CuCl<sub>2</sub>\u22c52H<sub>2</sub>O, Camellia sinensis leaf aqueous extract, copper nanoparticles, and Carboplatin (Standard positive control), MTT assay was used on normal (HUVECs) and human ovarian cancer (Caov-3, SW-626, and SK-OV-3) cell lines. Copper nanoparticles had high cell death and anti-human ovarian cancer properties against Caov-3, SW-626, and SK-OV-3 cell lines. Among the above cell lines, the best result was gained in the cell line of SW-626. According to the above findings, it looks copper nanoparticles green-synthesized by Camellia sinensis leaf aqueous extract have the potential to be used as a chemotherapeutic material for human ovarian cancers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
