Using HPLC, six alkamide fractions (alkamides 1, 2, 3, 6a/6, 7, 8/9) were quantitated in dried roots, whereas four alkamide fractions (alkamides 1, 2, 3, 8/9) were measured in dried leaves. Different elution conditions used in HPLC for alkamide analysis did not affect the eluted fractions nor the quantitation of different alkamides. Individual alkamide concentrations in roots and leaves were affected by the drying methods used. To preserve higher levels of total alkamides, FD was found to be the best method, VMD was a superior method for drying roots than AD at 70 degrees C, while AD at 50 degrees C was the preferred method for drying leaves of E. purpurea."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food, Nutrition and Health, University of British Columbia, 6650 NW Marine Drive, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "H O", "Initials": "HO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Durance", "ForeName": "T D", "Initials": "TD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scaman", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kitts", "ForeName": "D D", "Initials": "DD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Desiccation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Echinacea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10995335", "10.1021/jf000246n", "jf000246n"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
