For detail studies on antiinflammatory effects, gamma-(2-aminoethylamino)-2-butyrothienone (gamma-ABT) was chosen as representative of these new non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAID). The effect on mouse paw edema induced by various phlogistic agents was first investigated. The inhibitory effect of gamma-ABT on carrageenin-induced edema was remarkable and nearly equal to that of indometacin. Similarly to indometacin, gamma-ABT inhibited the early and late stage of yeast-induced edema in contrast to concanavalin A (Con A) induced edema which was only inhibited by gamma-ABT. Both the above induced edema are supposed to be unrelated to prostaglandins in the rat system. gamma-ABT displayed an inhibitory effect on nystatin-induced edema similar to indometacin suggesting that gamma-ABT has significant membrane stabilizing action and a strong blocking action on synthesis of prostaglandins. gamma-ABT inhibited as well the sustained edema induced by mustard. In conclusion gamma-ABT is an effective agent not only on acute but also on subacute and chronic inflammation and its mode of action appears similar to other NSAID. gamma-ABT posses in addition the advantage of antioxidant activity which is not shared by selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors and thus should be potentially effective in autoimmune diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Development and Molecular Biology, School of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Aristotelian University, Thessaloniki, Greece."}], "LastName": "Gavalas", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kourounakis", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Litina", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kourounakis", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Arzneimittelforschung", "NlmUniqueID": "0372660", "ISSNLinking": "0004-4172"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiophenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11028-71-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Concanavalin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "134257-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "gamma-(2-aminoethylamino)-2-butryothienone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1400-61-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Nystatin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9000-07-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Carrageenan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XXE1CET956", "NameOfSubstance": "Indomethacin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carrageenan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Concanavalin A"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Foot"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indomethacin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mustard Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nystatin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Thiophenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Yeasts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1859517"]}}]}
