One of the many possible cues that predators may use to find their prey are herbivore-induced plant volatiles. Although their effects on the behaviour of foraging predators have been well studied, little is known about how these prey-related odours affect predator-prey dynamics on a plant. We hypothesise that herbivore-induced plant volatiles provide the major cue eliciting predator arrestment on prey-infested leaves and that the response to these volatiles ultimately leads to lower prey densities. To test this hypothesis experimentally, we created two types of odour-saturated environments: one with herbivore-induced plant volatiles (treatment), and one with green-leaf volatiles (control). An odour-free environment could not be tested because herbivores require plants for population growth. We measured the rate at which predatory mites (Phytoseiulus persimilis) immigrate, emigrate and exploit a single leaf infested by two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae). The experiments did not show a significant difference between treatment and control. At best, there was a somewhat higher rate of predator (and possibly also prey) emigration in the treatment. The lack of a pronounced difference between treatment and control indicates that at the spatial scale of the experiments random searching for prey was as effective as directional searching. Alternatively, predators were arrested in the prey patch by responding not merely to herbivore-induced plant volatiles, but also to other prey-related cues, such as web and faeces. Based on our current experience we advocate to increase the spatial scale of the experiment (> 1 m2) and we provide other suggestions for improving the set-up."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Amsterdam, Section Population Biology, The Netherlands. pels@bio.uva.nl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pels", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sabelis", "ForeName": "M W", "Initials": "MW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Exp Appl Acarol", "NlmUniqueID": "8507436", "ISSNLinking": "0168-8162"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pheromones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Host-Parasite Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mites"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pheromones"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Dynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Predatory Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Exp Appl Acarol. 2000;24(12):881-95", "ArticleIdList": ["11354616"]}, {"Citation": "J Chem Ecol. 1993 Mar;19(3):581-99", "ArticleIdList": ["24248958"]}, {"Citation": "J Chem Ecol. 1990 Nov;16(11):3091-118", "ArticleIdList": ["24263298"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1997 Apr;110(2):179-185", "ArticleIdList": ["28307422"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11156167", "10.1023/a:1006436723266"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
