They are used as an unconventional therapy modality in the management of a wide range of cancer diseases, although no anticancer potential has yet been demonstrated. This prompted us to study the effect of galactoside-specific lectin (VAA)--a major protein constituent of mistletoe with immunomodulatory properties--on chemically induced tumor development in the urinary bladder of rats and on the local cellular immune response after long-term administration. To induce urothelial neoplasms N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) was administered in a single intravesical dose (7.5 mg/kg body weight). Highly purified VAA was given subcutaneously at its immunomodulatory dose (1 ng/kg body weight) twice a week over the total experimental period of 15 months. The incidences of epithelial bladder tumors were 25.0% following administration of MNU alone and 22.9% in the rats additionally receiving VAA, which proved not to be significantly different (P = 0.81). Quantitative immunohistochemistry analyzing a panel of immune cell types, including T lymphocytes, T helper/inducer cells (CD4), T suppressor/cytotoxic cells (CD8), T cells positive for interleukin-2 receptor (CD25), B lymphocytes and plasma cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, granulocytes and all leukocytes expressing the leukocyte common antigen (CD45), yielded no evidence for the ability of VAA to stimulate a substantial cellular immunological reaction in the wall of the normal urinary bladder or during urothelial carcinogenesis. In conclusion, the current experimental findings provide no support at all that the galactoside-specific mistletoe lectin is capable of inhibiting chemically induced bladder carcinogenesis and triggering a local cellular immune response after prolonged application. It thus seems highly improbable that commercial mistletoe preparations or VAA will be effective in the management of human bladder cancer by a cell-mediated immunological mechanism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Georg-August University, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Kunze", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schulz", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gabius", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Cancer Res Clin Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "7902060", "ISSNLinking": "0171-5216"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers, Tumor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toxins, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ribosome inactivating protein, Viscum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "684-93-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylnitrosourea"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Intravesical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Granulocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Killer Cells, Natural"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methylnitrosourea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Toxins, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Urinary Bladder"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology", "metabolism", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9654190", "10.1007/s004320050138"]}}]}
