Over 500 samples were tested and more than 30 substances with such activities were identified. Most, if not all, were plant diterpene esters derived from Euphorbiaceae and Thymelaeaceae families and a few were indole alkaloids of microbial origin. We attempted to link these laboratory findings with those of epidemiological field studies on three virus-associated diseases, Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, which are known to have a peculiar geographical distribution. Our hypothesis was that EBV-activating/tumor-promoting substances might be present in the abundant areas where such diseases are endemic. We noticed that many active diterpene ester-containing plants are widely used as herbal medicaments in Africa and China and determined many plant species that had such activities. One example is Aleurites fordii, a plant commonly grown in Southern China for industrial purposes which yielded a potent promoter substance (12-O-hexadecanoyl-16-hydroxyphorbol-13-acetate, HHPA). The active diterpene esters were purified and their possible mechanism was studied from the view of receptor-binding, protein kinase C activation and transmembrane signaling."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ito", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tokuda", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ohigashi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Koshimizu", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Princess Takamatsu Symp", "NlmUniqueID": "9301172"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens, Environmental"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carrier Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Drug"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "phorbol ester binding protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "phorbol ester receptor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Kinase C"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carrier Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Herpesvirus 4, Human"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Kinase C"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Activation"}], "NumberOfReferences": "37"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6097577"]}}]}
