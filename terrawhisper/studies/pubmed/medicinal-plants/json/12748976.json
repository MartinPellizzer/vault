With the advent of modern drug discovery technologies such as combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput drug screening platforms, there is an increasing interest in utilizing medicinal plants as a source of drug leads. A wide spectrum of bioassays can be employed for the detection of bioactivity in extracts, fractions, as well as purified compounds of herbal origin. Amongst the different types of bioassays, reporter gene assays are highly versatile and reliable. The present review provides an overview of the most popular reporter genes in terms of their basic methodology, capacities and limitations. The different types of intracellular and extracellular reporter gene products and their potential applications in bioassays of natural products are also discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "New", "ForeName": "D C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miller-Martini", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "Y H", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Fusion Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Reporter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Fusion Proteins"}], "NumberOfReferences": "77"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12748976", "10.1002/ptr.1312"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
