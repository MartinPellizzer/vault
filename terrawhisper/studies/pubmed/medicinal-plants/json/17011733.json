The grounded dried plant materials were extracted with different extractants and screened for anti-microbial activity using the disk diffusion and the micro-dilution techniques. Preliminary screening revealed that the methanol extracts were most active. Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacillus subtilis were the three test organisms, which were found to be susceptible to all the crude methanolic extracts of the different plants investigated (100% susceptibility), followed by Escherichia coli (57.1%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (57.1%), and Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%). The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration recorded for the different crude methanol extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis and the mould fungus Candida albicans were 500, 1000, 125, 250, 1000 and 125 micro g/ml, respectively. Bioautography using Cladosporium cucumerinum revealed that dichloromethane (DCM) extracts had the highest activity against the phytopathogenic fungus. It was also noted that the DCM extracts of Michelia champaca and Antidesma madagascariense yielded the maximum number of growth inhibiting compounds against Cladosporium cucumerinum. Activity of the different crude extracts was also investigated against several phytopathogenic filamentous fungi, Colletotrichum glocosporoides, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia sclerotium, Guignardia sp. and Fusarium oxysporum. It was found that crude hexane extracts as well as crude DCM extracts exhibited marked activity against several strains of fungi, especially Colletotrichum glocosporoides, Sclerotinia sclerotium and Guignardia sp."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Mauritius, Reduit, Mauritius."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rangasamy", "ForeName": "Oumadevi", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Raoelison", "ForeName": "Guy", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rakotoniriana", "ForeName": "Francisco E", "Initials": "FE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheuk", "ForeName": "Kiban", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Urverg-Ratsimamanga", "ForeName": "Suzanne", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Quetin-Leclercq", "ForeName": "Joelle", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gurib-Fakim", "ForeName": "Ameenah", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Subratty", "ForeName": "Anwar Hussein", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Candida albicans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cladosporium"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mauritius"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17011733", "10.1016/j.jep.2006.08.002", "S0378-8741(06)00379-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
