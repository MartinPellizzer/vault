The Cinnamomi Fructus medicinal materials were treated by water distillation, analyzed using GC-MS, and detected by selective ion monitoring(SIM), and the internal standards were used for quantification. The content results of Cinnamomi Oleum from various batches were analyzed by hierarchical clustering analysis(HCA), principal component analysis(PCA), and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis(OPLS-DA) for the statistic analysis. Eleven components showed good linear relationships within their respective concentration ranges(R~2&gt;0.999 7), with average recoveries of 92.41%-102.1% and RSD of 1.2%-3.2%(n=6). The samples were classified into three categories by HCA and PCA, and 2-nonanone was screened as a marker of variability between batches in combination with OPLS-DA. This method is specific, sensitive, simple, and accurate, and the screened components can be utilized as a basis for the quality control of Cinnamomi Oleum."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Chi", "ForeName": "Ming-Yan", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Zi-Peng", "Initials": "ZP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yue-Ting", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Yibai Pharmaceutical Co.,Ltd.
