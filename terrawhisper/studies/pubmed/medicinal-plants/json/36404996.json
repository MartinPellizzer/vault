In this context, the present study aims to examine and document the traditional food knowledge of local people in Uttarakhand State of India. Interviews and interactions with the local people resulted in documentation of 38 cuisines traditionally prepared by the local people of selected study regions in Uttarakhand. Apart from boiled rice and chapattis (flatbread) of wheat flour, chapattis and porridge of finger millet flour and boiled barnyard and foxtail millets were frequently consumed dishes in combination with dishes made with locally grown pulses such as horse gram and black gram and vegetables such as potato, radish and other leafy vegetables. The supplementary dishes were locally called as fanu, chaisu, gathoni, thechwani, kafli and kadhi. Plants formed the major ingredients in making traditional cuisines. The present study documented 41 plant species comprising of cereals, millets, pulses and spices. With a view to enhance the taste of the dishes, different spices and condiments such as <i>Allium humile, Allium wallichii, Cleome viscosa, Cannabis sativa, Perilla frutescens</i> and <i>Cinnamomum tamala</i> were used by the local people. These dishes possessed some unique characteristics and ethno-medicinal values; hence, when required, they were used to cure a number of ailments as well. Since most of the mountain region in the study area was once inaccessible and health facilities were not much developed till recent times, the traditional health-care system was supported by the traditional food systems. The findings of the present study are further discussed in the context of sustainability of socio-ecological systems of Uttarakhand."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Institute for Social and Economic Change 2022.
