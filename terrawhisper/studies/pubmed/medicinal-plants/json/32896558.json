Tartary buckwheat, as medicinal and food homologous crop, is rich in flavonoids, among which rutin may prevent liver damage. The one of the major objectives of Tartary buckwheat breeding is to cultivate varieties that have large fruits, high flavonoids and nutrient contents. Members of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP) superfamily play a vital role in the synthesis of flavonoids, plant growth and development. Whole-genome analyses of the CYP family have been performed in several plants, but the CYP family has not been characterized in Tartary buckwheat. In this study, 285 FtCYPs were identified from the genome to improve the rutin content and quality of Tartary buckwheat. By exploring the structure, motif composition, tandem and segmental duplication events of FtCYPs, as well as evolutionary relationships with CYPs in other plants, we preliminarily screened potential FtCYPs regulating rutin synthesis, growth and development. The expression levels of the FtCYPs in different organs and fruits at various periods were measured. This study provides a solid foundation for verifying the function of FtCYPs, cultivating high rutin Tartary buckwheat varieties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
