Plant parts were dried, ground and then extracted using DCM:MeOH (1:1). We measured the levels of \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein proteolytic products in HeLa cells stably transfected with APP carrying the Swedish mutation using ELISA.", "Of 33 plant extract 10 (30.3%) were found active based on the potential to significantly reduce the production of A\u03b242. Amongst them extracts of leaves of Xysmalobium undulatum (Apocynaceae), leaves of Cussonia paniculata (Araliaceae) and leaves of Schotia brachypetala (Fabaceae) potently decreased the production of A\u03b242 by 77.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5%, 57.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.3%, and 44.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1%, respectively. X. undulatum and S. brachypetala enhanced non-amyloidogenic processing of \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein, thereby decreasing A\u03b242 level. We also showed that C. paniculata induced the decrease of A\u03b242 level through inhibiting APP processing. In addition, we isolated two cardenolides, compound [A] and [B], from X. undulatum and found that they potently decreased the A\u03b242 production.", "These data suggest that the extract of X. undulatum, C. paniculata, and S. brachypetala have potential to be developed for Alzheimer's disease treatment. These active extracts and compounds are considered for further studies which examine their efficacy towards the reduction of A\u03b242 through inhibiting APP process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
