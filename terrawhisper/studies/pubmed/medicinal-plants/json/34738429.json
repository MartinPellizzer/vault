Based on the full-length transcriptome of Schisandra chinensis, bioinformatics methods were used to preliminarily identify the DIR gene family and analyze the physico-chemical properties, subcellular localization, conserved motifs, phylogeny, and expression patterns of the proteins. The results showed that a total of 34 DIR genes were screened and the encoded proteins were 156-387 aa. The physico-chemical properties of the proteins were different and the secondary structure was mainly random coil. Half of the DIR proteins were located in chloroplast, while the others in extracellular region, endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasm, etc. Phylogenetic analysis of DIR proteins from S. chinensis and the other 8 species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Glycine max demonstrated that all DIR proteins were clustered into 5 subfamilies and that DIR proteins from S. chinensis were in 4 subfamilies. DIR-a subfamily has the unique structure of 8 \u03b2-sheets, as verified by multiple sequence alignment. Finally, through the analysis of the transcriptome of S. chinensis fruit at different development stages, the expression pattern of DIR was clarified. Combined with the accumulation of lignans in fruits at different stages, DIR might be related to the synthesis of lignans in S. chinensis. This study lays a theoretical basis for exploring the biological functions of DIR genes and elucidating the biosynthesis pathway of lignans in S. chinensis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Yu-Qing", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Qiang", "ForeName": "Ting-Yan", "Initials": "TY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jiu-Shi", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Xue-Ping", "Initials": "XP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Yao-Dong", "Initials": "YD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hai-Tao", "Initials": "HT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ben-Gang", "Initials": "BG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignans"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lignans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Schisandra"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Alignment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "9"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34738429", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210723.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
