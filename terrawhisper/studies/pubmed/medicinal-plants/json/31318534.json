Chemical synthesis of cyclic peptides is essential when studying their structure-activity relationships. Conventional peptide cyclization methods via direct coupling have inherent limitations, like the susceptibility to epimerization at the C-terminus, poor solubility of fully protected peptide precursors, and low yield caused by oligomerization. In this regard, chemoselective ligation-mediated cyclization methods have emerged as effective strategies for cyclic peptide synthesis. The toolbox for cyclic peptide synthesis has been expanded substantially in the past two decades, allowing more efficient synthesis of cyclic peptides with various scaffolds and modifications. This Review will explore different chemoselective ligation technologies used for cyclic peptide synthesis that generate both native and unnatural peptide linkages. The practical issues and limitations of different methods will be discussed. The advance in cyclic peptide synthesis will benefit the biological and medicinal study of cyclic peptides, an important class of macrocycles with potentials in numerous fields, notably in therapeutics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, State Key Laboratory of Synthetic Chemistry , The University of Hong Kong , Pokfulam Road , Hong Kong SAR , P.
