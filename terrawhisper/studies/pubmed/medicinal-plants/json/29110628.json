The effects of 2-MS-Biotin on the STAT3 and NF-\u03baB pathways were examined by Western blotting. The cytotoxicity of 2- MS-Biotin was evaluated using real-time cell analysis system. Proteins directly bound to 2-MS-Biotin were pulled down through streptavidin agarose beads and were detected using Western blotting.", "2-MS-Biotin retained the inhibition activities of the parent compound 2-MS on the STAT3 and NF-\u03baB pathways as well as on cancer cell growth.
