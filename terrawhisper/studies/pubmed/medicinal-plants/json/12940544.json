A secretory antibody purified from transgenic tobacco was tested successfully in humans, and prevented bacterial re-colonization after topical application in the mouth. Rapid production of patient-tailored anti-lymphoma antibodies in recombinant Tobamovirus-infected tobacco may provide effective cancer therapy. Many different candidate vaccines from bacterial and viral sources have been expressed in transgenic plants, and three human clinical trials with oral delivery of transgenic plant tissues have shown exciting results. The use of crop plants with agricultural practice could allow cheap production of valuable proteins, while providing enhanced safety by avoidance of animal viruses or other contaminants. However development of this technology must carefully consider the means to ensure the separation of food and medicinal products when crop plants are used for phytopharming."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Tower Road, Ithaca, New York 14850, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Warzecha", "ForeName": "Heribert", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mason", "ForeName": "Hugh S", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882059", "ISSNLinking": "0176-1617"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vaccines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Vaccines"}], "NumberOfReferences": "76"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12940544", "10.1078/0176-1617-01125", "S0176-1617(04)70461-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
