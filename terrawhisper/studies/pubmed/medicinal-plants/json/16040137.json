Moreover, HSV-2 has been reported to be a high risk factor for HIV infection. Therefore, the discovery of novel anti-HSV drugs deserves great efforts. In this paper, we review anti-HSV substances from natural sources, including both extracts and pure compounds from herbal medicines, reported in studies from several laboratories. The role of traditional medicine for the development of anti-HSV compounds is also discussed. Interestingly, it was found that traditional medicines, like Ayurvedic, traditional Chinese (TCM), Chakma medicines, are good and potential sources for promising anti-HSV drugs. A second objective of this review is to discuss several anti-HSV compounds with respect to their structure-activity relationship (SAR). A large number of small molecules, like phenolics, polyphenols, terpenes (e.g., mono-, di-, tri-), flavonoids, sugar-containing compounds, were found to be promising anti-herpetic agents. Our major conclusion is that natural products from medicinal plant extracts are very important source of anti-HSV agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacology Research Laboratory, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Science and Technology Chittagong, Chittagong, Bangladesh. khnmmd@unife.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Mahmud Tareq Hassan", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ather", "ForeName": "Arjumand", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thompson", "ForeName": "Kenneth D", "Initials": "KD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gambari", "ForeName": "Roberto", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Antiviral Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8109699", "ISSNLinking": "0166-3542"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Antiviral Res. 2005 Sep;67(3):169"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Herpes Simplex"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Herpesvirus 1, Human"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}], "NumberOfReferences": "62"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16040137", "10.1016/j.antiviral.2005.05.002", "S0166-3542(05)00116-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
