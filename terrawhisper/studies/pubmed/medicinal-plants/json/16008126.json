Severely inflamed and dark coloured urinary bladders of the CTX alone treated animals were found to be normalized on morphological analysis by the treatment of AITC or PITC. Urine protein levels were reduced by the treatment with AITC (6.2 +/- 0.37 g/l) and PITC (6.56 +/- 1.56 g/l), which was elevated by CTX administration (8.66 +/- 0.47 g/l). Urine urea N2 that was enhanced significantly by CTX administration (26.87 +/- 1.86 g/l) was reduced by treatment with both AITC (17.38 +/- 0.06 g/l) and PITC (15.85 +/- 1.56 g/l). GSH content, which was drastically reduced by CTX administration in both bladder (0.87 +/- 0.1 nmol/mg protein) and liver (2.47 +/- 0.6 nmol/mg protein) was enhanced by treatment with AITC and PITC both in bladder (AITC- 3.65 +/- 0.18 nmol/mg protein; PITC- 2.8 +/- 0.15 nmol/mg protein) and in liver (AITC- 4.10 +/- 0.81 nmol/mg protein; PITC- 4.70 +/- 0.44 nmol/mg protein).
