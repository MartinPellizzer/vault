Hearts were subjected to 30\u00a0min of global ischemia followed by 45\u00a0min of reperfusion. The myocardial infarct size and the activities of creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured. Myocardial tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were detected. Western blot analysis was carried out to determine the cardioprotective mechanisms of PhG-RE.", "Hearts treated with PhG-RE showed a significant reduction in infarct size and decrease in CK-MB and LDH activities. PhG-RE also reduced MDA levels and elevated the activities of GSH-Px, SOD. The expressions of cytochrome-c were significantly reduced in the treated group. A significant upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2/Bax with simultaneous downregulation of cleaved-caspase-3 was observed. The molecular signaling cascade, including phospho-Akt (ser-473) and phospho-GSK3\u03b2 that lead to the activation or suppression of apoptotic pathway, also showed a significant protective role in the treatment group.", "The results suggested that the PhG-RE may reduce the oxidative stress in the reperfused myocardium and play a significant role in the inhibition of apoptotic pathways leading to cardioprotection."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc.
