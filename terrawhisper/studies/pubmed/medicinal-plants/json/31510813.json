The disturbance of redox homeostasis, by the overproduction of endogenous ROS/RNS, may increase the risk of development of so-called civilisation diseases. The solution seems to be either the increased production of endogenous or consumption of exogenous antioxidants. Plant-borne antioxidants act via different chemical and molecular mechanisms, such as decreasing the level of oxidative damage in cells directly by reacting with ROS/RNS or indirectly - by inhibition of the activity and expression of free radical generating enzymes or by enhancing the activity or expression of intracellular antioxidant defence enzymes. Despite the fact that the Caucasian flora is rich of health promoting edible/medicinal plants, recent studies concerning the biological activity of these plants are very scarce. This review is summarising the state-of-art on the health-promoting potential of plants representing the Caucasian flora, whose antioxidant capacity have been investigated in various <i>in vitro</i> models."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology & Biotechnology, Biology Faculty, Yerevan State University, Yerevan, Armenia."}], "LastName": "Sahakyan", "ForeName": "Naira", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology & Biotechnology, Biology Faculty, Yerevan State University, Yerevan, Armenia."}], "LastName": "Petrosyan", "ForeName": "Margarit", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1316-7673"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food, Chemistry, Technology and Biotechnology, Faculty of Chemistry, Gda\u0144sk University of Technology, Gda\u0144sk, Poland."}], "LastName": "Koss-Miko\u0142ajczyk", "ForeName": "Izabela", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food, Chemistry, Technology and Biotechnology, Faculty of Chemistry, Gda\u0144sk University of Technology, Gda\u0144sk, Poland."}], "LastName": "Bartoszek", "ForeName": "Agnieszka", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Health Care, Batumi Shota Rustaveli State University, Batumi, Georgia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Bioorganic Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Saarland University, Saarbruecken, Germany."}], "LastName": "Sad", "ForeName": "Tamara Gabour", "Initials": "TG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Bioorganic Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Saarland University, Saarbruecken, Germany."}], "LastName": "Nasim", "ForeName": "Muhammad Jawad", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Health Care, Batumi Shota Rustaveli State University, Batumi, Georgia."}], "LastName": "Vanidze", "ForeName": "Maia", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Health Care, Batumi Shota Rustaveli State University, Batumi, Georgia."}], "LastName": "Kalandia", "ForeName": "Aleko", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Bioorganic Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Saarland University, Saarbruecken, Germany."}], "LastName": "Jacob", "ForeName": "Claus", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology & Biotechnology, Biology Faculty, Yerevan State University, Yerevan, Armenia."}], "LastName": "Trchounian", "ForeName": "Armen", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9423872", "ISSNLinking": "1029-2470"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Nitrogen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Homeostasis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Nitrogen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31510813", "10.1080/10715762.2019.1648799"]}}]}
