Sequence analysis of CaH2B revealed that the clone contains an open reading frame of 145 amino acid residues, which are 77% identical to a maize H2B histone. The CaH2B mRNA was barely detectable in roots, was more abundant in anthers than in seedlings, and was expressed highest in floral buds and fruits. An in situ analysis of CaH2B in floral buds indicated that the transcript is highly present in the pollen and petals. Northern analysis of CaH4, a pepper H4 histone cDNA, which was obtained during the expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis of anther tissues, showed that the expression pattern was very similar to that of CaH2B, although the expression level was slightly different. Both histone genes were examined for inducibility by wounding, methyl jasmonate (MJ), or phytohormones. CaH2B and CaH4 were induced by wounding, and maximally induced ca. 3 h after wound treatment both in vitro and in planta. Airborne MJ greatly induced the expression of the genes as well. The inducing effect by wounding was suppressed by MJ, suggesting that wounding and MJ might have different roles in signal transduction for the histone gene induction. Southern blot hybridization showed that both H2B and H4 genes are comprised of multigene families in the hot pepper."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science, Sogang University, Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kwak", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S R", "Initials": "SR"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["AF038386", "AF038387"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Cells", "NlmUniqueID": "9610936", "ISSNLinking": "1016-8478"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Histones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxylipins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "900N171A0F", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl jasmonate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Library"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Histones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxylipins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Alignment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis, DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptional Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Wounds and Injuries"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9895118", "S1016-8478(23)13481-9"]}}]}
