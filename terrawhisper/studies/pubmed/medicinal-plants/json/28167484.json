Koch contains a variety of components such as flavonoid. The previous studies showed that flavonoid has anti-cancer properties. The aim of the present study was to determine the anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing potential of hydroalcoholic Achillea wilhelmsii C. Koch extract (HAWE) on MCF-7 and MDA-Mb-468 human breast carcinoma cell lines. The anti-proliferative activity of HAWE was evaluated using MTT, flowcytometry by annexin V/PI double staining, and caspase-3 activity. The results of MTT showed that the ED50 of MCF-7 and MDA-Mb-468 was 25\u03bcg/ml of HAWE, 48h after treatment. Flowcytometry by annexin V/PI showed that HAWE induced late apoptosis in MCF-7 and early apoptosis in MDA-Mb-468. In addition, the caspase-3 colorimetric method showed that caspase-3 increased in the MDA-Mb-468 after treatment with HAWE. This study found that the hydroalcoholic extract of Achillea wilhelmsii C. Koch induced apoptosis in both the MCF-7 and MDA-Mb-468 human breast carcinoma cell lines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Scientific Research Center, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran / Department of Clinical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Galavi", "ForeName": "Hamid Reza", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran / Department of Clinical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Saravani", "ForeName": "Ramin", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Sistan and Baluchestan, Zahedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shahraki", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ashtiani", "ForeName": "Mojtaba", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alcohols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Annexin A5"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "CASP3 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Achillea"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenocarcinoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohols"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Annexin A5"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28167484"]}}]}
