Evidence has been documented that the immune system is impressively involved in the pathogenesis of this disease, especially in causing inflammation. One of the important components of the immune system is the complement system whose increased activity has been shown in inflammatory diseases and consequently damage caused by the activity of its components. In the present study, serum levels of C3 and C4 factors as well as the activity level of complement system in the classical pathway were measured by CH50 test in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Participants in the study consisted of 53 hospitalized patients whose real-time PCR test was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The mean age of these patients was 42.06\u2009\u00b1\u200918.7\u00a0years, including 40% women and 60% men. The most common symptoms in these patients were cough (70%), fever (59%), dyspnea (53%) and chills (53%), respectively. Analysis of biochemical and hematological test results revealed that 26 (49%) patients had lymphopenia, 34 (64%) patients were positive for C-reactive protein (CRP) and 26 (49%) patients had ESR and LDH levels significantly higher than normal. In addition, 27 patients (51%) had vitamin D deficiency. The mean CH50 activity level in COVID-19 patients was significantly reduced compared to healthy individuals (84.9 versus 169.9 U/ml, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009<\u20090.0001). Comparison of the mean CH50 activity levels between different subgroups of patients indicated that COVID-19 patients with decreased peripheral blood lymphocyte count and positive CRP had a significant increase in activity compared to the other groups (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.0002). The serum levels of C3 and C4 factors had no significant change between patients and healthy individuals. Conclusion: The activity level of complement system in the classical pathway decreases in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy individuals, due to increased activity of complement system factors in these patients."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Indian Virological Society 2021."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.440801.9", "0000 0004 0384 8883"], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Keshavarz", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.412571.4", "0000 0000 8819 4698"], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghalamfarsa", "ForeName": "Farideh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.413020.4", "0000 0004 0384 8939"], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Javdansirat", "ForeName": "Saeed", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.413020.4", "0000 0004 0384 8939"], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hasanzadeh", "ForeName": "Sajad", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.413020.4", "0000 0004 0384 8939"], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Azizi", "ForeName": "Arsalan", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.413020.4", "0000 0004 0384 8939"], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sabz", "ForeName": "Gholamabbas", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.413020.4", "0000 0004 0384 8939"], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Salehi", "ForeName": "Marziyeh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.413020.4", "0000 0004 0384 8939"], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghalamfarsa", "ForeName": "Ghasem", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Virusdisease", "NlmUniqueID": "101624144", "ISSNLinking": "2347-3584"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "M.
