In previous studies, pharmaceutical excipients were recognized as inert substances in clinical safety evaluations. However, a large number of studies have shown that pharmaceutical excipients regulate the metabolism and transport of drugs in the body and improve the bioavailability. The pharmaceutical excipient polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG400) as a good solubilizer and surfactant has the potential to improve the bioavailability of drugs. The combined action of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and efflux transport proteins is responsible for the intestinal disposition and poor bioavailability of baicalein. Our aim is to study the effect of PEG400 on the absorption of baicalein on the Caco-2 monolayer, and confirm the interaction of PEG400 with UGTs (UGT1A8 and UGT1A9) and efflux transports. We initially found that baicalein in the Caco-2 monolayer would be metabolized into glucuronide conjugates BG and B6G under the action of UGT1A8 and UGT1A9 on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and then mainly excreted to different sides by acting of MRP and BCRP. The addition of PEG400 significantly accelerated the metabolism of B in Caco-2 cells and increased the penetration of BG and B6G. Furthermore, PEG400 also significantly decreased the efflux ratio of BG and B6G, which was the evidence of the interaction with the efflux transporters. In the in vitro intestinal microsome regeneration system, low concentration PEG400 decreased the K<sub>m</sub> value of UGT1A8 and UGT1A9 (key enzymes that mediate the production of BG and B6G); high concentration PEG400 enhanced the V<sub>max</sub> value of UGT1A8 and UGT1A9. In conclusion, our results determined that PEG400 interacted with some UGTs and efflux transporters, which were the main factors affecting the absorption of baicalein."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 The Authors.
