It can be divided into 6 categories by cluster analysis, namely: \u2160, big grain (diameter 1.5 mm above and 100 grains weight above 0.16 g), low ridge, hard; \u2161, big grain, low ridge, soft; \u2162, big grain, high ridge, soft, fruit; \u2163, big grain. high ridge, gray brown or dark brown; \u2164, small grain (diameter 1.5 mm below and 100 grain weight 0.16 g below), low ridge, hard, dark brown; \u2165, small grain, low ridge, hard, yellow brown. The 38 fruit samples were planted, among which 31 ones were P. frutescens var. frutescens, 4 ones P. frutescens var. crispa and 3 ones P. frutescens var. acuta. By chemotype classification, they were 29 PK type, 3 PA type, 2 PL type, 2 PP type, 1 EK type and 1 PAPK type. According the description of herb Perillae Fructus in China Pharmacopoeia, the plant originates from P. frutescens var. frutescens. In contrast, not all fruits of P. frutescens var. frutescens have accord features. The fruits with white pericarp are mainly from P. frutescens var. frutescens with purple leaves. The materials with small grain, low ridge, hard, yellow brown or dark brown, are likely to be PA type and mainly P. frutescens var. crispa."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030024, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chen-Wu", "Initials": "CW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Chang-Ling", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030024, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Fen", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030024, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "An-Jia", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Bao-Lin", "Initials": "BL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Perilla"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29027425", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170217.012"]}}]}
