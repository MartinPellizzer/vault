The flavoring value is related to the lactones' ring size and chain length, which blend in varying concentrations to produce different stone-fruit flavors. The nature-identical and enantiomeric pure (+)-lactones are only produced through whole-cell biotransformation of yeast. The industrially important \u03b3-decalactone and \u03b4-decalactone are produced by a four-step aerobic-oxidation of ricinoleic acid (RA) following the lactonization mechanism. Recently, metabolic engineering strategies have opened up new possibilities for increasing productivity. Another strategy for increasing yield is to immobilize the RA and remove lactones from the broth regularly. Besides flavor impact, \u03b3-, \u03b4-, \u03b5-, \u03c9-lactones of the carbon chain (C8-C12), the macro-lactones and their derivatives are vital in pharmaceuticals and healthcare. These analogues are isolated from natural sources or commercially produced via biotransformation and chemical synthesis processes for medicinal use or as active pharmaceutical ingredients. The various approaches to biotransformation have been discussed in this review to generate more prospects from a commercial point of view. Finally, this work will be regarded as a magical brick capable of containing both traditional and genetic engineering technology while contributing to a wide range of commercial applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Syed", "ForeName": "Naziya", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Suman", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Enzyme and Microbial Biochemistry Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Chaturvedi", "ForeName": "Shivani", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Gaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Nannaware", "ForeName": "Ashween Deepak", "Initials": "AD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Enzyme and Microbial Biochemistry Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Khare", "ForeName": "Sunil Kumar", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Gaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Rout", "ForeName": "Prasant Kumar", "Initials": "PK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lactones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "5"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35531939", "10.1080/10408398.2022.2068124"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
