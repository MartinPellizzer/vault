During cardiac arrest, catecholamines and pressor agents have been shown to improve the rate of success of resuscitation. The useful properties of these drugs are mediated by strong alpha-adrenergic stimulation resulting in improved coronary perfusion. beta-Adrenergic stimulation during cardiac arrest is unimportant for resuscitation and potentially harmful. Studies have not demonstrated a difference between mixed agonists and alpha-agonists with respect to overall outcome. Consequently, the panel recommended that epinephrine continue to be the primary vasopressor for use during cardiac arrest. For cardiovascular support in the hemodynamically unstable patient, the panel recommended that drugs be chosen for specific pharmacologic actions that will allow the needed physiologic manipulation guided by objective hemodynamic measurements. The panel found that digitalis preparations and corticosteroids have very limited use in emergency cardiac care."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Otto", "ForeName": "C W", "Initials": "CW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Circulation", "NlmUniqueID": "0147763", "ISSNLinking": "0009-7322"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adrenal Cortex Hormones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adrenergic alpha-Agonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adrenergic beta-Agonists"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Adrenal Cortex Hormones"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Adrenergic alpha-Agonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Adrenergic beta-Agonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Resuscitation"}], "NumberOfReferences": "28"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2877753"]}}]}
