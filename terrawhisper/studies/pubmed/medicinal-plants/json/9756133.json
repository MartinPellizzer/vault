Thonningia sanguinea, a plant used prophylactically against bronchial asthma in Ghana was recently found to have antioxidative and hepatoprotective actions in our laboratory. 2. In this study, the effect of T. sanguinea extract on certain biochemical indices in serum and liver of Fischer 344 rats given a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose (1 mg/kg) of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was investigated. 3. Administration of AFB1 resulted in significant increases in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) levels and a significant decrease in aniline hydroxylase activity in liver microsomes. When T. sanguinea (5 ml/kg) was intraperitoneally administered to rats 12 h and 1 h before AFB1, liver injury was significantly reduced as seen in the decreased levels of serum ALT and serum GST. However, the decrease in aniline hydroxylase activity by AFB1 was not recovered but enhanced by T. sanguinea pre-treatment. 4. Kinetic analysis of cytochrome P450 activity of rat liver microsomes in vitro demonstrated that T. sanguinea inhibited aniline hydroxylase non-competitively suggesting depression of biotransformation of AFB1 to toxic metabolites. 5. The data indicate a hepatoprotective action of T. sanguinea against AFB1-induced liver injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Physiology and Pharmacology, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan."}], "LastName": "Gyamfi", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aniya", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hum Exp Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "9004560", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9N2N2Y55MH", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxin B1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Mixed Function Oxygenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Alanine Transaminase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxin B1"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intraperitoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mixed Function Oxygenases"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9756133", "10.1177/096032719801700802"]}}]}
