This study measured the heavy metal concentrations in eight different types of medicinal herbs and eight different types of herbal distillates sold in the markets in Sanandaj, Kurdistan, Iran. The concentration of some metals (Cd, Cu, Mn, Fe, Zn, Al, Co, Ni, Cr, Pb, and Mg) was quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and the associated health risk for adults and children was estimated. The mean concentration of all the metals was within the permissible limits set by the WHO. The medicinal herbs contained significantly more Al, As, Cd, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn (p\u2009<\u20090.02) than the herbal distillates. However, the concentrations of Cu and Hg were higher in the herbal distillates. The non-carcinogenic risks of consumption of traditional medicines in adults and children were assessed based on the target hazard quotients (THQs). The THQs for individual metals (except Al and Cr) from individual herbs were less than 1, which is considered as safe for human consumption."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Research Center, Research Institute for Health Development, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kohzadi", "ForeName": "Shadi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Research Center, Research Institute for Health Development, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shahmoradi", "ForeName": "Behzad", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaderi", "ForeName": "Ebrahim", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Loqmani", "ForeName": "Hozan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8261-8717"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Research Center, Research Institute for Health Development, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran. maleki43@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Maleki", "ForeName": "Afshin", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "1393/08", "Agency": "kurdistan university of medical sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biol Trace Elem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7911509", "ISSNLinking": "0163-4984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29700699", "10.1007/s12011-018-1357-3", "10.1007/s12011-018-1357-3"]}}]}
