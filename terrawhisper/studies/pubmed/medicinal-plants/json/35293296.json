Opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pores was assessed as mitochondrial swelling and observed spectrophotometrically as changes in absorbance under succinate-energized conditions. Cytochrome c release was also assessed spectrophotometrically.", "From the results, CSE, MOE, CEP, and MEP inhibited lipid peroxidation and scavenged nitric oxide and DPPH radicals in a concentration-dependent manner. All extracts exhibited greater ferric reducing antioxidant potential. More so, the results showed that CSE, MOE, CEP, and MEP possess the substantive amount of total flavonoids and total phenolics. CSE and MOE had higher total flavonoids and total phenolic content when compared with the epiphytes. HPLC-DAD results revealed Tangeretin as the most abundant in CSE; Eriocitrin in citrus epiphytes; Moringine in MOE and Flavones in moringa epiphytes. All extracts inhibited calcium-induced opening of the pores in a concentration- dependent manner, with C. sinensis leaf extract (CSE) and moringa epiphyte (MEP) being the most potent in this regard with no significant release of cytochrome c at all concentrations.", "The results suggest that CSE and MEP have bioactive agents, which could be useful in the management of diseases where too much apoptosis occurs characterized by excessive tissue wastage, such as neurodegenerative conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Federal University Oye Ekiti, Ekiti, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Adeoye", "ForeName": "Akinwunmi O", "Initials": "AO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Federal University Oye Ekiti, Ekiti, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Falode", "ForeName": "John A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Federal University Oye Ekiti, Ekiti, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Jeje", "ForeName": "Temitope O", "Initials": "TO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Federal University Oye Ekiti, Ekiti, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Agbetuyi-Tayo", "ForeName": "Praise T", "Initials": "PT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Federal University Oye Ekiti, Ekiti, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Giwa", "ForeName": "Sikirat M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Federal University Oye Ekiti, Ekiti, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Tijani", "ForeName": "Yesirat O", "Initials": "YO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Federal University Oye Ekiti, Ekiti, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Akinola", "ForeName": "Damilola E", "Initials": "DE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Discov Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "101157212", "ISSNLinking": "1570-1638"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-43-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochromes c"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Citrus sinensis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochromes c"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Moringa oleifera"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35293296", "10.2174/1570163819666220315124507", "CDDT-EPUB-121586"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
