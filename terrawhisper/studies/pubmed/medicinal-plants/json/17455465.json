The UV spectrum of the same samples were scanned simultaneously. The wavelength of the best correlation between UV absorbance and chlorogenic acid content determined by HPLC was chosen and the chlorogenic acid content of aqueous solution of Flos Lonicerae Japonicae extraction was estimated by prediction equation. Other 10 batches of aqueous solution of Flos Lonicerae Japonicae extraction was used for testing the equation by comparison of the values of chlorogenic acid content determined by HPLC and equation.", "Good linearity of chlorogenic acid was obtained within the range of 0.09-2.25 microg by HPLC; The recovery was 100.4%; RSD was 1.1% (n = 5). The best wavelength in UV spectrum correlating with chlorogenic acid content was 294 nm. The prediction equation: chlorogenic acid content C = 2.703 425A(294 nm) - 0.129 18; Good correlation between chlorogenic acid content determined by HPLC and predicted results was found (r = 0.995 2, n = 11).
