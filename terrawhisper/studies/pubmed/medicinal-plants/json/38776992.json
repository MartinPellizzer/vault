In the present study, we comprehensively investigated the effect of polystyrene (PS) NPs on dandelion plants grown under Cd stress. Cd exposure significantly inhibited the growth of dandelion seedlings, resulting in a decrease in seedling elongation from 26.47% to 28.83%, a reduction in biomass from 29.76% to 54.14%, and an exacerbation of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. The interaction between PS NPs and Cd resulted in the formation of larger aggregates, with the Cd bioavailability reduced by 12.56%. PS NPs affect ion absorption by regulating reactive oxygen production and increasing superoxide dismutase activity, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of Cd. PSCd aggregates induced significant changes in the metabolic profiles of dandelions, affecting various carbohydrates related to alcohols, organic acids, sugar metabolism, and bioactive components related to flavonoids and phenolic acids. Furthermore, based on a structural equation model, exposure to PSCd activated oxidative stress and nutrient absorption, thereby affecting plant growth and Cd accumulation. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the effects of PS NPs on Cd bioavailability, accumulation, and plant growth, which are crucial for understanding the food safety of medicinal plants in a coexistence environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
