Here, we demonstrated that CNCP induced apoptotic cell death in human kidney-2 (HK-2) cells in a concentration-dependent manner (IC<sub>50</sub>\u202f=\u202f19.3\u202f\u03bcM) and led to the sustained elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>). Lower extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations from 2.3\u202fmM to 0\u202fmM significantly suppressed the CNCP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response by 69.1%. Moreover, the depletion of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores using thapsigargin normalized CNCP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, suggesting that the CNCP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response involved both extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. SAR7334, a TRPC3/6/7 channel inhibitor, but neither Pyr3, a selective TRPC3 channel inhibitor, nor Pico145, a TRPC1/4/5 inhibitor, suppressed the CNCP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response by 57.2% and decreased CNCP-induced cell death by 53.4%, suggesting a critical role for TRPC6 channels in CNCP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and apoptotic cell death. Further electrophysiological recording demonstrated that CNCP directly activated TRPC6 channels by increasing channel open probability with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 6.01\u202f\u03bcM. Considered together, these data demonstrate that the direct activation of TRPC6 channels contributes to CNCP-induced apoptotic cell death in HK-2\u202fcells. Our data point out the potential risk of renal toxicity from CNCP if used as a therapeutic agent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
