In this study, three kinds of nano-FeS hybridized electrode biofilms, obtained through synchronous biosynthesis (Sy-FeS), sequential biosynthesis (Se-FeS) and cathode biosynthesis (Ca-FeS), were applied as biocathodes for Cr<sup>6+</sup> removal in MFCs. The Ca-FeS biocathode exhibited the best performance due to the superior properties of biogenic nano-FeS (e.g., more synthetic amount, smaller particle size, better dispersion). The MFC with the Ca-FeS biocathode achieved the highest power density (42.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.42\u00a0mW/m<sup>2</sup>) and Cr<sup>6+</sup> removal efficiency (99.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0%), which were 1.42 and 2.08 times as high as those of the MFC with the normal biocathode, respectively. The synergistic effects of nano-FeS and microorganisms enhanced the bioelectrochemical reduction of Cr<sup>6+</sup>, first realizing deep reduction of Cr<sup>6+</sup> to Cr<sup>0</sup> in biocathode MFCs. This significantly alleviated the cathode passivation caused by Cr<sup>3+</sup> deposition. In addition, the hybridized nano-FeS as \"armor\" layers protected the microbes from toxic attack by Cr<sup>6+</sup>, improving the biofilm physiological activity and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secretion. The hybridized nano-FeS as \"electron bridges\" facilitated the microbial community to form a balanced, stable and syntrophic ecological structure. This study proposes a novel strategy through the cathode in-situ biosynthesis of nanomaterials to fabricate hybridized electrode biofilms with enhanced EET and microbial activity for toxic pollutant treatment in bioelectrochemical systems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
