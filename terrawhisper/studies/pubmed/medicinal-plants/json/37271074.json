Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). Here, we investigated the protective effect of 1,8-cineole on DR and found that 1,8-cineole treatment could alter the expression of several genes in both high glucose (HG)-induced ARPE-19 cells and retinal tissues of DM mice, as well as inhibit ferroptosis. Subsequent investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibition revealed that expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) was significantly upregulated while that of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) was significantly downregulated in HG-induced ARPE-19 cells, and treatment with 1,8-cineole could effectively reverse these changes. Treatment with a PPAR-\u03b3 pharmacological agonist (rosiglitazone), alone or combined with 1,8-cineole, significantly inhibited the transcription of TXNIP and ferroptosis in HG-induced ARPE-19 cells. Conversely, pretreatment with GW9662, a PPAR-\u03b3 inhibitor, upregulated the transcription and expression of TXNIP in HG-induced ARPE-19 cells; 1,8-cineole failed to reverse this upregulated expression. To explore these relationships, we constructed a PPAR-\u03b3 adenovirus shRNA to elucidate the effect of 1,8-cineole on the negative regulation of TXNIP by PPAR-\u03b3. Taken together, the present findings indicate that HG-induced ferroptosis in retinal tissue plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of DR, which can be ameliorated by 1,8-cineole."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
