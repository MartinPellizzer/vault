The study was double blind. By using query-sheets personal contact was excluded. The first result was a placebo-effect of 35% for disaccustoming of smokers and no statistically significant effect of the extract of Avena sativa. The second result was a difference of disaccustoming between light and heavy smokers. It was shown, that the rate of disaccustoming was higher for light smokers than for smokers with a high consumption of cigarettes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schmidt", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Geckeler", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Int J Clin Pharmacol Biopharm", "NlmUniqueID": "7505527", "ISSNLinking": "0340-0026"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1976", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["794001"]}}]}
