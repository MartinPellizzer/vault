The 41 data were averagely obtained by inquiry form, i.e. 41,984 information for the whole research. The most voluminous was the group of 64 recipes, including 39 for gums diseases and 25 for toothache, while only seven ones were mentioned for magic way of treatment. Among them, 18 prescriptions were of nonherbal origin. The study revealed 84 herbal original prescriptions, including 67 plant species (29 families) including local name, synonyms, and preparation mode. Traditional healers used predominantly herbal recipes to treat painful tooth, gum disease, blisters - herpetic ulcers/lips and mouth/, stomatitis/painful mouth, ptyalismus/, maxillary sinusitis, bad breath, teeth cleaning and bleaching. Very few methods of treatment appeared as inadequate (magical practice), whereas majority were noted as beneficial ones (herbal medicine). Still many people in distant nonurban areas use various plant recipes, especially as the first aid in oral disease healing.", "The significance of plants obtained from unpolluted areas, whose active ingredients have not yet been used in dental pharmaceutics, should be further investigated in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry and Endodontics, School of Dental Medicine, Belgrade University, Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Ilic", "ForeName": "Dragan V", "Initials": "DV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Biochemistry, School of Dental Medicine, Belgrade University, Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Radicevic", "ForeName": "Biljana Andjelski", "Initials": "BA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Sofia University \"St. Kliment Ohridski\", Sofia, Bulgaria."}], "LastName": "Nedelcheva", "ForeName": "Anely", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "New York University, Queeny, USA."}], "LastName": "Djurovic", "ForeName": "Ivana", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry and Endodontics, School of Dental Medicine, Belgrade University, Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Ostojic", "ForeName": "Dejan", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Intercult Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "101653911", "ISSNLinking": "2146-8397"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict of Interest: None declared."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Gavrilovic V.
