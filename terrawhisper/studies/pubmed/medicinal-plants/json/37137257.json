The kidney of euryhaline teleost plays important roles in not only osmoregulation but also regulation of intermediary metabolism. However, the renal responses of metabolism and osmoregulation in L. crocea to low salinity waters are still rarely reported. In this work, renal metabolomic analysis based on MS technique was conducted on the L. crocea following cultivation in salinities of 24, 8, 6, 4, and 2\u00a0ppt for 40\u00a0days. A total of 485 metabolites covering organic acids and derivatives (34.17\u00a0%), lipids and lipid-like molecules (17.55\u00a0%), organoheterocyclic compounds (12.22\u00a0%), nucleosides, nucleotides, and analogues (11.91\u00a0%), and organic oxygen compounds (10.97\u00a0%), were identified in L. crocea kidney. Compared with control group (salinity 24), nearly all amino acids, nucleotides, and their derivatives were decreased in the kidney of L. crocea, whereas most of lipid-related metabolites including phospholipid, glycerophospholipids, and fatty acids were increased. The decrease in urea and inorganic ions as well as TMAO, betaine and taurine in L. crocea kidney suggested the less demand for maintaining osmotic homeostasis. Several intermediary metabolites covering amino acids, TCA cycle intermediates, and fatty acids were also significantly changed to match with the shift of energy allocation from osmoregulation to other biological processes. The reduced energy demand for osmoregulation might contribute to the promotion of L. crocea growth under low salinity environment. What is more, carbamoylphosphate and urea that showed linear salinity response curves and higher ED<sub>50</sub> values were potential biomarkers to adaptation to low salinity water. Overall, the characterization of metabolomes of L. crocea kidney under low salinity provided a better understanding of the adaptive mechanisms to low salinity water and potentially contributed to a reference for optimal culture salinity and feed formula of L. crocea culture in low salinity water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
