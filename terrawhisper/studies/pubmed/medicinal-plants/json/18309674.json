The mice were pretreated with PJ before administering ethanol to observe the effect on the concentration of ethanol in serum and urine. The contents of MDA, GSH and GSH-PX, CAT and SOD activities were measured in serum and gastric mucosa, and subsequently, the pathological evaluation of stomach was also observed.", "The concentration of ethanol in serum was evidently decreased after PJ (1.5, 3.0 g x kg(-1)) was administrated because the ethanol was eliminated fleetly through urine. Synchronously the PJ reduced the content of MDA and increased the GSH increased in serum and gastric, besides, it increased the enzymatic activities of GSHPX, CAT and SOD, and the ethanol-induced gastric mitochondria structure injury were ameliorated so as to make the function to normal.", "Based on these observations, one could conclude that the PJ is a potent protective agent against ethanol-induced gastric damages. One mechanism may be related with inhibiting the absorbability of ethanol at gastrointestinal tract, decreasing the concentration of ethanol in serum, and accelerating the ethanol elimination through urine so as to alleviate the ethanol-induced damage to gastrointestinal mucosal, enhancing the first-pass metabolism in stomach, and particularly increasing the antioxidant levels in serum and gastric. These gastroprotective effects might be, at least partly, through ameliorating the gastric mitochondria structure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou 310021, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "You-Gui", "Initials": "YG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Shi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Dong-Feng", "Initials": "DF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18309674"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
