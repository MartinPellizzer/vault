This study is a randomised clinical trial that was conducted on unexplained infertile women referred to infertility Clinic in Yasuj, Iran. All participants were stimulated by letrozole, clomiphene and HMG during the cycle. When at least one follicle was greater than 18\u2009mm, 5000\u2009IU hCG intramuscularly was administered for ovulation induction and then IUI was performed 34-36\u2009hours later. In GCSF group, 300\u2009\u03bcg GCSF subcutaneously administrated in two days after IUI. Control group received routine IUI. The main outcome measures were biochemical pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, abortion and ongoing pregnancy rate. Our results showed no statistically significant difference in the biochemical pregnancy (16.3% vs. 12.2%; <i>P</i>=.56), clinical pregnancy (16.3% vs. 8.2%; <i>P</i>=.21), abortion (0 vs. 2.04%; <i>P</i>=.55) and ongoing pregnancy rates (8.2% vs. 14.2%; <i>P</i>=.32) between the control and the G-CSF groups. The results of the current study suggest that systemic administration of 300\u2009\u03bcg GCSF in the two days after receiving IUI in patients with unexplained infertility does not offer any beneficial clinical related implantation, and pregnancy rates. <b>IRCT registration number:</b> IRCT20160524028038N4 Impact statement<b>What is already known on this subject?</b> Unexplained infertility means to the inability of couples in pregnancy after a year without obvious male and female infertility factors. Some patients have not been justified in endometrial function, which leads to the defect of the dialogue between the foetus and endometrium and may lead to implantation failure. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor\u00a0is produced at the maternal-foetal interface during embryo implantation and is the main part of the uterine-cytokine network that is needed to create and maintain pregnancy.<b>What do the results of this study add?</b> The current study suggests that systemic administration of 300\u2009\u03bcg granulocyte colony stimulating factor in the two days after receiving IUI in patients with unexplained infertility does not offer any beneficial clinical related implantation and pregnancy rates.<b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> These results may not be generalised to all patients and more randomised controlled trials are needed for the comparison of granulocyte colony stimulating factor\u00a0effects on women with thin and normal endometrial thickness, efficacy, side effects, and pregnancy outcomes of the intrauterine perfusion versus systemic subcutaneous administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factor\u00a0in unexplained infertility treated with intrauterine insemination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gynecologic and Obstetrics Department, School of Medicine, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aramesh", "ForeName": "Shahintaj", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fertility and Infertility Research Center, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran."}], "LastName": "Azizi Kutenaee", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gynecologic and Obstetrics Department, School of Medicine, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Najafi", "ForeName": "Fataneh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gynecologic and Obstetrics Department, School of Medicine, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaffari", "ForeName": "Parvin", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Taghavi", "ForeName": "Seyed Abdolvahab", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Obstet Gynaecol", "NlmUniqueID": "8309140", "ISSNLinking": "0144-3615"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "143011-72-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1HRS458QU2", "NameOfSubstance": "Clomiphene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7LKK855W8I", "NameOfSubstance": "Letrozole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abortion, Spontaneous"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Clomiphene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertility"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Infertility"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Infertility, Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Insemination, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Letrozole"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ovulation Induction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Rate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35787135", "10.1080/01443615.2022.2080534"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
