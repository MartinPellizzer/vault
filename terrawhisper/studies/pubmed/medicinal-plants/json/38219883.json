Formulations of mouth gel containing KG2 at 0.10%, 0.25%, and 0.50% w/w were evaluated for color, smell, pH values, viscosity, and separation. Also, the chemical and biological stabilities of mouth gel containing KG2 were evaluated by heating-cooling test. The anti-inflammatory activity was tested against RAW 264.7\u00a0cells nitric oxide (NO) production and wound healing assay was performed using human gingival fibroblasts (HGF).", "Compound KG2 exhibited anti-NO production with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 66.8\u00a0\u03bcM and the wound healing activity of compound KG2 showed cell viability in the range of 90.9-111.4%. In addition, compound KG2 at a concentration of 3\u00a0\u03bcM induced the highest proportion of cell migration on day 3\u00a0at 90.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4%. The mouth gel containing KG2 both before and after the heating-cooling test exhibited good consistency, with pH values in the range of 6.64-6.71 (before) and 6.63-6.68 (after). Meanwhile, the viscosity was 81,700-96,700\u00a0cP (before) and 78,300-93,300\u00a0cP (after). For the chemical stability test of the active ingredient of mouth gel, the compound showed good stability after mixing with the gel base. The mouth gel exhibited anti-inflammation with IC<sub>50</sub> values\u00a0>\u00a01000\u00a0\u03bcg/ml both before and after accelerating conditions. The wound healing activity of mouth gel containing KG2 (0.50% w/w) showed the highest % cell viability at 128.6% (before) and 123.8% (after). For cell migration, the result suggested that the mouth gel containing KG2 at 0.10%, 0.25%, and 0.50% w/w (3\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) on day 3 enhanced cell migration higher than that of the positive controls both before (85.0-96.8%) and after (and 84.4-94.3%) the accelerating conditions.", "The present study shows that mouth gel containing 0.50% KG2 is the most appropriate with good physical, chemical, and biological stabilities and might be one of the alternative sources for treatment of mouth ulcers (oral stomatitis) derived from aphthous ulcers, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy treatments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
