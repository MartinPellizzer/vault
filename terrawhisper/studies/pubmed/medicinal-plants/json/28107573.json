The diversity of actinomycetes in plants and their tissue parts is a matter of debate as no consensus are derived between individual studies. Nevertheless, their diversity correlates with the occurrence in plant species harboured in unique regions of biologically diverse areas called \"hot spots.\" Recent advances in the isolation techniques have facilitated the isolation of rare taxa from these environments. The biosynthetic ability of the endophytic actinomycetes has proven beyond doubt that these organisms have the potential to synthesize an array of compounds with novelty in structure and bioactivity and as a result are preferred in the natural product screening programs. In the years to come, the scientific world may await to discover many more novel actinomycete taxa with metabolic diversity and applications in therapeutics.", "\"Endophytes\" - the microbes residing in the living tissues of plants are virtually omnipresent. Actinomycete endophytes are diverse in distribution within plant tissues, especially in the roots as they have a close association with the rhizhosphere. An introspection into diversity studies necessitates careful sampling, analysis, and isolation data from the biodiverse and nonbiodiverse regions represented by unique environments. The key to the recovery of novel species and their bioprospection lies in these regions."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 The Society for Applied Microbiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Studies in Botany, University of Mysore, Mysore, India."}], "LastName": "Nalini", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Studies in Biotechnology, University of Mysore, Mysore, India."}], "LastName": "Prakash", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Lett Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8510094", "ISSNLinking": "0266-8254"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Actinobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodiversity"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioprospecting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28107573", "10.1111/lam.12718"]}}]}
