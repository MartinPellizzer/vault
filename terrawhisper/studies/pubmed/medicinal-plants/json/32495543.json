There is also a growing demand for land for the cultivation of Chinese medicinal materials.Based on the analysis of the demand characteristics of planting habitats for Chinese medicinal herbs, this paper finds that compared with the cultivated environment, the wild environment is more conducive to the improvement of the quality and stress resistance of medicinal plants. The eco-planting for Chinese medicinal materials is the only way to achieve high quality, efficient and sustainable production of traditional Chinese medicine. Therefore, according to the habitat distribution characteristics of wild medicinal plants, combined with the current situation of land resource utilization in China and the increasing demand for land for Chinese herbal medicine cultivation, the land use strategy of Chinese herbal medicine ecological agriculture was proposed. \u2460 To vigorously develop underwood planting and change the existing field cultivation mode. \u2461 To make full use of mountainous areas and barren slopes to carry out wild planta tending or planting imitates wild condition. \u2462 According to the development law and biological characteristics of medicinal plants, the land resources should be developed and used rationally according to local conditions.This can not only meet the requirements of the specific growth environment of Chinese medicinal materials, realize the sustainable development of the Chinese medicinal materials industry, but also increase the economic income of people in mountainous areas, provide scientific and effective solutions for the land use of Chinese medicinal materials, and also have important significance for the protection of wild Chinese medicinal materials."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China Hubei University of Chinese Medicine Wuhan 430065, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Yang", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Chuan-Zhi", "Initials": "CZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wen-Jin", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Pharmaceutical University Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Liang-Yun", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Xiu-Fu", "Initials": "XF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Lyu", "ForeName": "Chao-Geng", "Initials": "CG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lu-Qi", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei University of Chinese Medicine Wuhan 430065, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Da-Hui", "Initials": "DH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32495543", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200302.104"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
