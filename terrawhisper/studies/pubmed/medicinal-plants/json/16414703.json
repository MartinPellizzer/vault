The compounds were separated by column chromatography and spectral studies i.e. IR and UV were performed to ascertain their chemical nature. The anti-microbial activity of crude extracts and purified compounds was tested against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and a fungus. All the micro-organisms tested were markedly inhibited, however, the crude extracts as well as the purified compounds isolated from the seeds of A. belladonna and D. fastuosa showed little inhibitory activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Allama Iqbal Campus, Lahore-54000, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "F Z", "Initials": "FZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alam", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saleem", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rashid", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16414703"]}}]}
