Putrescine N-methyltransferase (PMT) catalyzes the N-methylation of putrescine to form N-methylputrescine. While the role of PMT in nicotine biosynthesis is clear, knowledge of PMT in the biosynthesis of tropane alkaloids (TAs) and the regulation of polyamines remains limited. We characterized a PMT gene from Hyoscyamus niger, designated HnPMT that was specifically expressed in roots, especially in the secondary roots and dramatically induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA). The GUS gene was specifically expressed in Arabidopsis roots or in the vascular tissues, including pericycles and endodermis, of the H. niger hairy root cultures, when it was driven by the 5'-flanking promoter region of HnPMT. The recombinant HnPMT was purified for enzymatic assays. HnPMT converted putrescine to form N-methylputrescine, as confirmed by LC-MS. The kinetics analysis revealed that HnPMT had high affinity with putrescine but low catalytic activity, suggesting that it was a rate-limiting enzyme. When HnPMT was suppressed in the H. niger plants by using the VIGS approach, the contents of N-methylputrescine and hyoscyamine were markedly decreased, but the contents of putrescine, spermidine and a mixture of spermine and thermospermine were significantly increased; this suggested that HnPMT was involved in the biosynthesis of tropane alkaloids and played a competent role in regulating the biosynthesis of polyamines. Functional identification of HnPMT facilitated the understanding of TA biosynthesis and thus implied that the HnPMT-catalyzed step might be a target for metabolic engineering of the TA production in H. niger."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
