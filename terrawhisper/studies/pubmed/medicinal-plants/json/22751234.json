Little is known of the potential for adverse drug reactions between these. Warfarin is a commonly prescribed medication, well known for its potential to cause serious adverse reactions in combination with many prescription medicines. It has been suggested that herbal medicines such as garlic, either as a dietary supplement or in cooking, may also interact with warfarin, resulting in poor international normalised ratio (INR) control.", "To determine whether, for patients who take garlic as well as warfarin, the proportion of the INR tests in range is lower than in comparable patients who do not take garlic.", "Retrospective study of patients taking prescribed warfarin.", "Primary care practices in Somerset and Devon.", "Three controls (not taking garlic) matched for age, sex, and general practice were compared with each patient self-reporting taking garlic as a supplement. INR results were assessed for the preceding 12 months. Potentially confounding factors were considered, for example diabetes mellitus; all prescribed medication; any bleeding episodes.", "No evidence was found to suggest that garlic consumption either as a supplement or in cooking is associated with more frequent haemorrhagic complications or less control of INR. Poor INR control may, however, be associated with taking larger numbers of prescription medicines, particularly during prescription changes.", "Further research would be warranted into whether increased INR monitoring is needed when drug changes are made. These data render clinically significant interactions between warfarin and garlic intake unlikely."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "East Somerset Research Consortium, West Coker, Somerset. research@esrec.nhs.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Lindsay", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ernst", "ForeName": "Edzard", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ewings", "ForeName": "Paul", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Allen", "ForeName": "Jeffrey", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Caroline", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Quinlan", "ForeName": "Catherine", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Gen Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "9005323", "ISSNLinking": "0960-1643"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticoagulants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5Q7ZVV76EI", "NameOfSubstance": "Warfarin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Anticoagulants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "International Normalized Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Warfarin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "British Medical Association.
