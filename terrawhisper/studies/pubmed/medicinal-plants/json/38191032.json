These phytochemicals offer excellent protection from various illnesses, including inflammatory disorders and chronic conditions caused by oxidative stress. A phenolic monoterpenoid known as eugenol (EUG), it is typically found in the essential oils of many plant species from the Myristicaceae, Myrtaceae, Lamiaceae, and Lauraceae families. One of the main ingredients of clove oil (Syzygium aromaticum (L.), Myrtaceae), it has several applications in industry, including flavoring food, pharmaceutics, dentistry, agriculture, and cosmeceuticals. Due to its excellent potential for avoiding many chronic illnesses, it has lately attracted attention. EUG has been classified as a nonmutant, generally acknowledged as a safe (GRAS) chemical by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to the existing research, EUG possesses notable anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic, antibacterial, antispasmodic, and apoptosis-promoting properties, which have lately gained attention for its ability to control chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial malfunction and dramatically impact human wellness. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the scientific evidence from the most significant research studies that have been published regarding the protective role and detoxifying effects of EUG against a wide range of toxins, including biological and chemical toxins, as well as different drugs and pesticides that produce a variety of toxicities, throughout view of the possible advantages of EUG."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
