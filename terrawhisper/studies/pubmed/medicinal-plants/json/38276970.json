In this process, a wide range of methyl thioesters were obtained in moderate to excellent yields. This novel strategy features the first use of DMSO as a methylthiolating agent for the construction of methyl thioesters, transition metal-free conditions, inexpensive reagents, easy workup, broad substrate scope and sustainability. Additionally, this procedure can be readily scaled up to a gram scale."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China. 1039160204@qq.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products Research Center of Guizhou Province, Guiyang 550014, PR China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Ding-Yong", "Initials": "DY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China. 1039160204@qq.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products Research Center of Guizhou Province, Guiyang 550014, PR China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hong-Shi", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Food, Guizhou Vocational College of Agriculture, Guiyang 550041, PR China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "En-Hua", "Initials": "EH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China. 1039160204@qq.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products Research Center of Guizhou Province, Guiyang 550014, PR China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China. 1039160204@qq.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products Research Center of Guizhou Province, Guiyang 550014, PR China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Ting-Fei", "Initials": "TF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China. 1039160204@qq.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products Research Center of Guizhou Province, Guiyang 550014, PR China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0696-2668"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China. 1039160204@qq.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products Research Center of Guizhou Province, Guiyang 550014, PR China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Sheng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0710-4569"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China. 1039160204@qq.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products Research Center of Guizhou Province, Guiyang 550014, PR China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qi-Ji", "Initials": "QJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China. 1039160204@qq.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products Research Center of Guizhou Province, Guiyang 550014, PR China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Li-Shou", "Initials": "LS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1535-3282"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China. 1039160204@qq.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products Research Center of Guizhou Province, Guiyang 550014, PR China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Sheng", "Initials": "XS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Org Biomol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101154995", "ISSNLinking": "1477-0520"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38276970", "10.1039/d3ob01991h"]}}]}
