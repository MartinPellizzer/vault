The mean cocaine concentration in the hair of these five subjects was 15.2 ng/mg hair +/- 11.0 (range = 1.0-28.9 ng/mg), mean BE concentration was 2.8 +/- 1.6 ng/mg hair (range = 0.3-4.4 ng/mg hair), and mean EME concentration was 1.6 +/- 1.7 (range = 0.0-4.4 ng/mg hair). The finding that cocaine was present at approximately 5 times higher concentration than BE and approximately 12 times higher than EME is surprising in light of the much longer plasma half lives of these metabolites. Washing the hair before analysis with 1% dodecyl sulfate, methanol, and distilled water reduced the concentration of cocaine in the hair but also reduced the concentrations of the metabolites. These data suggest that factors other than the drug concentration in blood may be important in determining the amount of drug incorporated into hair."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Medicine, University of California-Davis 95616."}], "LastName": "Henderson", "ForeName": "G L", "Initials": "GL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Harkey", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "R T", "Initials": "RT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Anal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7705085", "ISSNLinking": "0146-4760"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "5353I8I6YS", "NameOfSubstance": "benzoylecgonine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I5Y540LHVR", "NameOfSubstance": "Cocaine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y35FJB3QBJ", "NameOfSubstance": "ecgonine methyl ester"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coca"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cocaine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hair"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Substance-Related Disorders"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1522717", "10.1093/jat/16.3.199"]}}]}
