The conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plants is important for the industrial production of plant-based medicines. Different cryopreservation methods are used for long-term culture preservation, which allows fast regeneration of the preserved plant material with the maintenance of its primary original traits. These methods could ensure the sustainable indefinite supply of plant tissues for theoretically unlimited periods of time, and have gained considerable attention in recent years. It is important to assess the recovery rate and the genetic stability of the recovered plant tissues after cryopreservation because cryopreservation efficiency differs among plant tissues and species. This review lays particular emphasis on the pharmaceutical applications of plant secondary metabolites that are produced through tissue culture approaches, highlighting the methods used for their cryopreservation, as well as their recovery and genetic stability."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
