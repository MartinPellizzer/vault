Utmost care would therefore be taken for growth, development and sustainability of these important crops and medicinal plants and microbes. Homeobox genes and HOX clusters and their recently characterized expanded family members, including newly discovered homeobox, WOX gene from medicinal herb, Panax ginseng, significantly contributes in the growth and development of these organisms. On the other hand, secondary metabolites produced through secondary metabolism of plants and microbes are used as organisms defense as well as drugs/drug-like molecules for humans. Both the developmental HOX cluster and the biosynthetic gene-cluster (BGC) for secondary metabolites are organized in organisms genome. Genome mining and genomewide analysis of these clusters will definitely identify and characterize many more important molecules from unexplored plants and microbes and underexplored human microbiota and the evolution studies of these clusters will indicate their source of origin. Although genomics revolution now continues at a pace, till date only few hundred plant genome sequences are available. However, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology now in market and may be applied even for plants with recalcitrant genomes, eventually may discover genomic potential towards production of secondary metabolites of diverse plants and micro-organisms present in the environment and microbiota. Additionally, the development of tools for genome mining e.g., antiSMASH, plantiSMASH, and more and more computational approaches that predicts hundreds of secondary metabolite BGCs will be discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V. and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Biochimie et Biologie Mol\u00e9culaire (SFBBM).
