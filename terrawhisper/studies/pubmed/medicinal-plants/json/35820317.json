Plant-based compounds are very well known to regress colon cancer in many ways, like delaying tumor growth, managing chemotherapy and radiation therapy side-effects, and working at the molecular levels. Medicinal plants contain many bioactive phytochemicals such as flavonoids, polyphenol compounds, caffeic acid, catechins, saponins, polysaccharides, triterpenoids, alkaloids, glycosides, phenols, quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol and luteolin glycosides, carnosic acid, oleanolic acid, rosmarinic acid, emodin, and eugenol and anthricin. These bioactive compounds can reduce tumor cell proliferation via several mechanisms, such as blocking cell cycle checkpoints and promoting apoptosis through activating initiator and executioner caspase. Traditional medicines have been used globally to treat cancers because of their anti-cancer effects, antioxidant properties, anti-inflammatory properties, anti-mutagenic effects, and anti-angiogenic effects. In addition, these medicines effectively suppress early and intermediate stages of carcinogenesis when administered in their active and pure form. However, traditional medicine is not very popular due to some critical challenges. These include poor solubility and absorption of these compounds, intellectual property-related issues, involvement of drug synergism, absence of drug-likeness, and unsure protocols for their extraction from the plant source. Using bioactive compounds in colon cancer has equal advantages and limitations. This review highlights the benefits and challenges of using bioactive compounds derived from plants for colon cancer. We have also discussed using these compounds to target cancer stem cell self-renewal, its effects on cancer cell metabolism, safety parameters, easy modulation, and their bioavailability."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
