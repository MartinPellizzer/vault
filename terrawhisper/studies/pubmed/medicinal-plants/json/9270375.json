Nine compounds, tricin (1), luteolin (2), thalictoside (3), icariin I (4), baohuoside I (5), quercitrin (6), icariin (7), epimedin C (8), and B (9) were isolated from this species for the first time, and 3 was isolated for the first time from flavonoid extracts of the genus. Their structures were established by chemical and spectroscopic methods. The immunomodulatory effects of the n-butanol fraction and epimedin C isolated from the fraction were investigated. Hydrocortisone acetate (HCA) was used as an immunosuppressant to inhibit the immune response of mice. The n-butanol fraction and epimedin C significantly enhanced the response of spleen antibody-forming cells (SAFC) to near normal in the mice treated with HCA. They also significantly enhanced lymphocyte proliferation and caused a significant recovery of interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in the mice inhibited with HCA. In conclusion, they are active principles with immunoenhancing effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Helsinki, Finland."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "H R", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vuorela", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vuorela", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hiltunen", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Antibody-Producing Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9270375", "10.1055/s-2006-957690"]}}]}
