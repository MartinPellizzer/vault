Lipid nanoparticles are able to significantly improve the oral bioavailability, pharmacokinetic profile, skin permeability, and ocular residence time of drugs, demonstrating considerable potential in pharmaceutical or medical practice.", "This article profoundly reviews important applications of lipid nanoparticles in active natural medicines. Special concerns focus on solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) for their training in the oral, intravenous, percutaneous and ocular drug delivery.", "The survey shows that lipid nanoparticles are promising vehicles for the delivery of various natural actives and may address some intractable problems associated with delivery thereof."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, Jinan University, Guangzhou.
