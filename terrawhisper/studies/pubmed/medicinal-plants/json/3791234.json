The tumorigenic properties of MNPN and its potential to methylate DNA in F344 rats were evaluated. Groups of 21 male and 21 female rats were given 60 s.c. injections over a 20-week period (total doses 0.055 and 0.23 mmol per rat). The experiment was terminated after 106 weeks. MNPN at the higher dose induced 18 (86%) malignant tumors of the nasal cavity in male and 15 (71%) in female rats. The lower dose induced nine (43%) liver tumors. Groups of four or five male F344 rats were treated with a single s.c. or i.v. injection of MNPN (0.4 mmol/kg). MNPN was also administered to rats by swabbing the oral cavity (2.21 mmol/kg). The levels of 7-methylguanine and O6-methylguanine, formed 0.5-36 h after treatment, were measured in the liver, nasal mucosa, esophagus, and oral issues. The highest levels of methylated guanines were detected in the nasal cavity independent of the route of administration. The results of this study demonstrate that MNPN is present in the saliva of betel quid chewers and is a potent carcinogen in F344 rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Prokopczyk", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rivenson", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bertinato", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brunnemann", "ForeName": "K D", "Initials": "KD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hoffmann", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA-29580", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Res", "NlmUniqueID": "2984705R", "ISSNLinking": "0008-5472"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrosamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60153-49-3", "NameOfSubstance": "3-(methylnitrosamino)propionitrile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Esophageal Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrosamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Nose Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Saliva"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3791234"]}}]}
