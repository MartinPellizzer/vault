(St. John's wort) is widely used in homeopathic medicine, but has also become a serious weed in Australia and many other countries. Reproduction in H. perforatum was investigated using markers based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Between two Australian populations, plants displayed 14 polymorphisms from a total of 22 scorable RFLP markers when genomic DNA was probed with M13 bacteriophage, but individuals within each population exhibited identical RFLP fingerprints. Ninety-four percent of the progeny of four crosses made between the two populations exhibited identical fingerprint and ploidy level to the maternal parent, and probably originated apomictically. Seven seedlings with recombinant RFLP or AFLP fingerprints were found from a total of 121 progeny. Both molecular marker techniques detected the same recombinants from a subset of screened progeny. Cytological analysis showed that the seven recombinants comprised three tetraploids (2n = 4x = 32), three hexaploids (2n = 6x = 48), and one aneuploid (2n - 1 = 31), which suggested that the level of normal reduced embryo sacs was only 2.5%. These results are discussed in relation to the management of invasive populations, and the implications for plant breeding and production of St. John's wort for medicinal purposes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied and Molecular Ecology, Co-operative Centre for Australian Weed management, Waite Campus, the University of Adelaide, Australia. gwenmayo@senet.com.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mayo", "ForeName": "Gwenda M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Langridge", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Genome", "NlmUniqueID": "8704544", "ISSNLinking": "0831-2796"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crosses, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Fingerprinting"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis, DNA"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12897865", "10.1139/g03-038", "g03-038"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
