Inflammation and oxidative stress play a key role in gentamicin (GM) nephrotoxicity. We investigated the protective effect of the melatonergic agonist agomelatine (AGM) on GM nephrotoxicity, emphasizing the involvement of TLR-4 signaling, SIRT1 and PPAR\u03b3. Rats received 25\u00a0mg/kg AGM for 15\u00a0days and 100\u00a0mg/kg GM for eight days starting at day 7. Elevated serum creatinine, urea and Kim-1 along with multiple histological alterations in the kidney were observed in GM-intoxicated rats. Malondialdehyde (MDA), TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, nitric oxide (NO) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were increased, and GSH, SOD and catalase were decreased in the kidney of GM-intoxicated rats. Treatment with AGM significantly ameliorated the kidney function biomarkers, prevented tissue injury, decreased inflammatory cytokines, MDA, NO and MPO, and boosted antioxidants. In addition, AGM suppressed the expression of TLR-4, NF-\u03baB p65, p38 MAPK, ERK-1, VCAM-1 and iNOS, whereas upregulated SIRT1 and PPAR\u03b3 in the kidney of GM-intoxicated rats. In conclusion, AGM prevented GM nephrotoxicity in rats by attenuating oxidative injury and inflammation. AGM suppressed TLR-4 signaling, enhanced antioxidants and upregulated SIRT1 and PPAR\u03b3 in the kidney of GM-induced rats."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
