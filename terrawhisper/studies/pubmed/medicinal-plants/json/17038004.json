Diseases that affect mainly poor people are neglected in research advancements in treatment because they cannot generate large financial returns on research and development costs. Benefit sharing arrangements for the use of indigenous resources and genetic research could only marginally address this gap in research and development in diseases that affect the poor. Benefit sharing as a strategy is conceptually problematic, even if one, as we do, agrees that impoverished indigenous communities should not be exploited and that they should be assisted in improving their living conditions. The accepted concept of intellectual property protection envisages clearly defined originators and owners of knowledge, whereas the concept of community membership is fluid and indigenous knowledge is, by its very nature, open, with the originator(s) lost in the mists of time. The delineation of 'community' presents serious conceptual and practical difficulties as few communities form discrete, easily discernable groups, and most have problematic leadership structures. Benefit sharing is no substitute for governments' responsibility to uplift impoverished communities. Benefit sharing arrangements may be fraught with difficulties but considerations of respect and equity demand that prior informed consent and consultation around commercialisation of knowledge take place with the source community and their government."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Ethics in Public Policy and Corporate Governance, Glasgow Caledonian University, Glasgow, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sch\u00fcklenk", "ForeName": "Udo", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kleinsmidt", "ForeName": "Anita", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Dev World Bioeth", "NlmUniqueID": "101120122", "ISSNLinking": "1471-8731"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodiversity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developed Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "International Cooperation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organizations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patents as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Population Groups"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poverty"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Policy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Social Justice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Donors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United Nations"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17038004", "10.1111/j.1471-8847.2006.00149.x", "DEWB149"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
