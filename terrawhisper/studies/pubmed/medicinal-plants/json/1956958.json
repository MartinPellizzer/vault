Applications of phytotherapy for various gastrointestinal conditions are discussed for the examples of three remedies. The first example is liquorice root, its active principle carbenoxolone, and the drugs Biogastrone and Caved-S for the treatment of gastic, peptic and duodenal ulcers; the second example is the fruits of the milk thistle, its active principles silymarin and silybinin as well as the drug Legalon for the treatment of liver diseases. The third example concerns the use of laxatives of plant origin such as plantain seeds and the drugs Agiocur and Agiolax. The review concludes with suggestions for the future course of phytotherapeutic research."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medizinische Abteilung B, Krankenhaus Rissen, Hamburg, Federal Republic of Germany."}], "LastName": "Fintelmann", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "14"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1956958"]}}]}
