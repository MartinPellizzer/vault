The larval mortality was calculated after 24\u00a0h treatment.", "Among tested fractions, the highest larvicidal efficacy was observed from ethyl acetate fraction of fruits extract with 50% and 90% mortality values (LC<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>90</sub>) of 34.49\u00a0g/L and 108.61\u00a0g/L, respectively. Chloroform fraction of fruits extract was the second larvicidal sample with LC<sub>50</sub> of 45.11\u00a0g/L and LC<sub>90</sub> of 139.36\u00a0g/L.
