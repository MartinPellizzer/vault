For evaluation of antinociceptive effects, the chronic (formalin test) and acute (tail-flick) pain models of rats were used. For the anti-inflammatory effects, the paw inflammation model was used through subcutaneous injection of 5% formalin to the paw of male rats. Water extracts of the fruit and its components in the single dose were assessed through comparison with the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of sodium salicylate (SS) as a positive control. Administration of 300 mg/kg of SS (i.p.) had no effect on tail flick latency, while 1000 mg/kg of total (i.p. and p.o.) and endocarp (i.p.) extract, increased this latency (P<0.01, P<0.001, respectively), which was not reversed by naloxone (2 mg/kg). In the formalin test, SS (300 mg/kg, i.p.) and the extract (1000 mg/kg, p.o. ) alleviated the animals nociception in the second phase, while in the first phase they were not effective. The total and endocarp extracts (1000 mg/kg, i.p.) showed a significant effect on both phases (P<0.01, P<0.001, respectively) which was also not reversed by naloxone (2 mg/kg, i.p.). In the acute anti-inflammatory test, the total extract and the aqueous extract of individual fruit components showed a significant effect (P<0.001). This anti-inflammatory effect was not significant compared with the anti-inflammatory effect of SS. Because of the extract effect on the tail-flick latency and both phases of the formalin test, the site of its analgesic action is probably central, and the mechanism of antinociceptive action of the extract are not related to the opioid system. Our phytochemical studies indicated that aqueous extract of E. angustifolia fruit contains flavonoids, terpenoids and cardiac glycosides."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Shaheed Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, PO Box 19835-355, Tehran, Iran. aaz@farabi.hbi.dmr.or.ir"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahmadiani", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hosseiny", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Semnanian", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Javan", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saeedi", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kamalinejad", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saremi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1HG84L3525", "NameOfSubstance": "Formaldehyde"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Formaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intraperitoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Reaction Time"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10967484", "10.1016/s0378-8741(00)00222-1", "S0378-8741(00)00222-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
