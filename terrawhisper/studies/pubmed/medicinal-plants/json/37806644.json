(SH) is a medicinal and aromatic herb utilized markedly in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries because of its specific secondary metabolites (SMs), especially monoterpenoids. However, the impact of elicitors on the expression of monoterpene synthase genes in SH remains unexplored. Therefore, the supreme objective of this research was to elucidate the phyto-biochemical and targeted genes expression responses of SH to the exogenous application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Accordingly, having chosen four concentrations of MeJA, they sprayed at the five-leaf stage for two weeks, and then leaves were harvested at two exposure times of 24 and 48 hrs for further analysis, using spectrophotometric, real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) methods. The results highlight that not only were the highest contents of phenolic, flavonoids, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, proline, and malondialdehyde in the elicited SHs but also the highest expression of \u03b2-farnesene synthase (BFS) and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductase (DXR) genes together with the highest amount of carvacrol were up-regulated in them compared to their respective control. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate the great industrial potential of MeJA in improving the production of phytochemicals in medicinal plants, particularly in SH."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
