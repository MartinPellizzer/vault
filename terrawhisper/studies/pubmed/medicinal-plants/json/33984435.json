The major compounds in the resin are triterpenoids, but as no studies have been performed on the bark, this study investigated this economically important resource. Ten folk healers were interviewed about their medicinal uses of C. strictum. Resin and bark were extracted with dichloromethane followed by methanol using accelerated solvent extraction. The extracts were fractionated using different chromatographic methods, and isolated compounds were identified by NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS. Resin and bark extracts were investigated for DPPH radical scavenging, 15-lipoxygenase inhibition, effects on nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-activated dendritic D2SC/I cells and toxicity against Artemia salina nauplii. Traditional healers used resin to treat colds, airway afflictions and rheumatoid arthritis. \u03b1-Amyrin and \u03b2-amyrin were identified as the major constituents in the dichloromethane resin extract. From the stem bark, procyanidins, gallic acid, methyl gallate, scopoletin, 3,3'-di-O-methylellagic acid 4-O-\u03b1-arabinofuranoside and elephantorrhizol (3,3',4',5,6,7,8-heptahydroxyflavan) were isolated and identified. By GC-MS, \u03b1-amyrin and \u03b2-amyrin and their acetates, lupeol, and taraxasterol were identified. Radical scavenging, 15-lipoxygenase inhibitory activity and inhibition of NO production was observed from resin and bark extracts, and no toxicity towards Artemia salina nauplii was found. Triterpenoids and procyanidins are the major compounds in C. strictum resin and stem bark, respectively. The high content of triterpenoids might contribute to anti-inflammatory effects and give a rationale for the widespread usage of the resin in India."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
