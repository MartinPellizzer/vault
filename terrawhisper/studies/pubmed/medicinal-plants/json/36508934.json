Many cases of OCD are considered to be familial or heritable in nature. It has been shown that a variety of internal and external risk factors are involved in the pathogenesis of OCD. Among the internal factors, genetic modifications play a critical role in the pathophysiological process. Despite many investigations performed to determine the candidate genes, the precise genetic factors involved in the disease remain largely undetermined. The present review summarizes the single nucleotide polymorphisms that have been proposed to be associated with OCD symptoms, early onset disease, neuroimaging results, and response to therapy. This information could help us to draw connections between genetics and OCD symptoms, better characterize OCD in individual patients, understand OCD prognosis, and design more targeted personalized treatment approaches."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
