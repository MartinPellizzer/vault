Based on these analyses, the differences of volatile components in M. haplocalyx from Jiangsu, Anhui and other regions were compared. The results showed that the volatile oil of M. haplocalyx was divided into four chemical types\uff1amenthol-menthone type, pulegone-menthone type, piperitone-menthol type, piperitone epoxide type, and menthol-menthone type was the principal type. Menthol was the highest and pulegone was the lowest. The differences of M. haplocalyx from Anhui and other regions were obvious. The major volatile components and the differences of M. haplocalyx from different regions were confirmed and a quantitative method was established for the determination of volatile components, which provided the basis for improving the quality standard of M. haplocalyx."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Yi-Ming", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Yue", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Sang", "ForeName": "Meng-Ru", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Da-Wei", "Initials": "DW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chan-Chan", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Ling-Ling", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization, Nanjing 210023, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National and Local Collaborative Engineering Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization and Formulae Innovative Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Qi-Nan", "Initials": "QN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mentha"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29192452", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0132"]}}]}
