One of the main problems of present chemotherapy in treatment of tumor patients is the toxicity of drugs. Most of the existent anticancer drugs, unfortunately, attack also proliferating normal cells. In recent years, traditional Chinese herbal remedies have gradually gained considerable attention as a new source of anticancer drugs. Although their healing mechanisms are still largely unknown, some of the drugs have been used to help cancer patients fight their disease at reduced side effects compared to other treatments. In our study, we show that Rocaglamide (Roc), derived from the traditional Chinese medicinal plants Aglaia, induces apoptosis through the intrinsic death pathway in various human leukemia cell lines and in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia cells freshly isolated from patients. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms by which Roc kills tumors revealed that it induces a consistent activation of the stress-response mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 accompanied with a long-term suppression of the survival MAPK extracellular signal-regulated kinase. These events affect proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins leading to depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential and trigger caspase-mediated apoptosis involving caspase-9, -8, -3 and -2. Importantly, Roc shows no effects on MAPKs in normal lymphocytes and therefore has no or very low toxicity on healthy cells. Up to now, more than 50 different Roc derivatives have been isolated from Aglaia. Our study suggests that Roc derivatives may be promising candidates for the development of new drugs against hematologic malignancies."], "CopyrightInformation": "(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tumor Immunology Program (D030), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jia Y", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lavrik", "ForeName": "Inna N", "Initials": "IN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mahlknecht", "ForeName": "Ulrich", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Giaisi", "ForeName": "Marco", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Proksch", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krammer", "ForeName": "Peter H", "Initials": "PH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li-Weber", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "0042124", "ISSNLinking": "0020-7136"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzofurans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tubulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "84573-16-0", "NameOfSubstance": "rocaglamide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzofurans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia, Myeloid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tubulin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17565740", "10.1002/ijc.22883"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
