Here we will show the effect of acupuncture on plants. When plants of Phaseolus vulgaris L. pole bean (cv. Kentucky wonder) and bush bean (cv. Slenderette) were subjected to acupuncture by inserting two needles into opposite sides of the stem of the unifoliolate buds, it was found that acupuncture strengthened the growth and development of the plants. Two repeated experiments showed that the mean net photosynthesis rate of plants subjected to acupuncture increased about 20.5%, the mean transpiration 27.2%, the growth and total length of internodes 22.5%, and the total dry weight of shoots from the cotyledon to the apex 22.9%, in comparisons with control plants under the same growing conditions. In addition, treated plants flowered three days earlier and had 14.4% more fruit than the untreated control plants. Thus, acupuncture may serve as a viable technique for increasing yield in agricultural plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Academy of Forestry Science, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "T Z", "Initials": "TZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "M D", "Initials": "MD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Am J Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7901431", "ISSNLinking": "0192-415X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acupuncture Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meridians"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Development"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9288359", "10.1142/S0192415X97000159", "S0192415X97000159"]}}]}
