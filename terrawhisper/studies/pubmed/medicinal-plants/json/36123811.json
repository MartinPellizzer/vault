Indeed, QA possesses an important antibacterial effect which could be explained by the fact that this molecule modules the functions of ribosomes and the synthesis of aminoacyl-tRNAs, modifications the levels of glycerophospholipids and fatty acids and disruption of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway thereby causing interference with membrane fluidity. The antidiabetic activity of AQ is achieved by stimulation of insulin secretion <i>via</i> the mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular reserves and the increase in the NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+ ratio. Its anticancer effect is through the promotion of apoptosis, inhibition of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and signaling pathways involving protein kinase C (PKC) and certain mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), resulting in the downregulation of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) expression. Therefore, this review describes the main research work carried out on the biological properties of AQ and the mechanism of action underlying some of these effects, as well as the investigations of the main pharmacokinetic studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment and Health Team, Polydisciplinary Faculty of Safi, Cadi Ayyad University, Safi, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Benali", "ForeName": "Taoufiq", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Engineering, Valorization, and Environment Team, Polydisciplinary Faculty of Taroudant, Ibn Zohr 19 University, Agadir, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Bakrim", "ForeName": "Saad", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Geo-Bio-Environment Engineering and Innovation Laboratory, Molecular Engineering, Biotechnologies and Innovation Team, Polydisciplinary Faculty of Taroudant, Ibn Zohr University, Agadir, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Ghchime", "ForeName": "Rokaia", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Microbial Biotechnology and Bioactive Molecules, Sciences and Technologies Faculty, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, Fez, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Benkhaira", "ForeName": "Nisrine", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Histology, Embryology, and Cytogenetic, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Rabat, Morocco."}], "LastName": "El Omari", "ForeName": "Nasreddine", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biodiversity, Ecology and Genome, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University, Rabat, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Balahbib", "ForeName": "Abdelaali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department 16 of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Molecular Modeling, Materials, Nanomaterials, Water and Environment Laboratory institution, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Rabat, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Taha", "ForeName": "Doaue", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Science Faculty, Selcuk University, Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Zengin", "ForeName": "G\u00f6khan", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Life Science, Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, Tangail, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Hasan", "ForeName": "Mohammad Mehedi", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, Shifa Tameer-e-Millat University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Bibi", "ForeName": "Shabana", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Human Pathologies Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, and Genomic Center 11 of Human Pathologies, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Rabat, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Bouyahya", "ForeName": "Abdelhakim", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Genet Eng Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "8510274", "ISSNLinking": "0264-8725"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "23"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36123811", "10.1080/02648725.2022.2122303"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
