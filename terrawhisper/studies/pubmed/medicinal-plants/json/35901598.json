In vivo and in vitro studies of antioxidant activity were performed, Orthogonal Partial Least Squares analysis was applied for spectrum-effect correlation between antioxidant activity and HPLC fingerprint. The compound synthesizing fingerprint (CSF) of ZZJHP was fitted with 8 HMs, and the contribution of the single herb to prescription was evaluated by Sub-quantified profiling method.", "The content of 11 analytes and fingerprints of ZZJHP were measured simultaneously, 32 batches of samples were divided into 6 grades. In vivo and in vitro researches suggested significant antioxidant activity capacity of ZZJHP. Then, spectrum-effect relationship study showed that 24 of the 30 fingerprint peaks had antioxidant activity. By prescription and decomposition profiling, the qualitative and quantitative contributions of the 8 herbs were revealed in turn. The negative solution experiment proved that CSF could accurately predict the quality of composite drugs.", "The intelligent prediction strategy could intervene at the source to realize rapid screening of HMs and prediction of the quality of preparations, which could provide guidance for the use of HMs and improve the quality of composite drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier GmbH.
