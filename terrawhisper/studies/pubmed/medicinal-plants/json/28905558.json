The ecological factors and contribution rate were determined by using maximum entropy (Maxent) model. Then, the information entropy theory was used to determine the relative importance of each environmental factor, and thus to determine the most limiting habitat criteria. Finally, the probable spatial distribution of P. heterophylla was determined based on GIS spatial analysis of habitat conditions. Meanwhile, the optimal index range of ecological factors was quantified. The moderately and highly suitable habitats were mainly located in Shibing, Huangping, Cengong, the middle and east of Kaili, the south of Yuqing, the west of Tongren. The percentage of moderately and highly suitable habitats for P. heterophylla in the study area was 3.64%, and its area was 6 405.39 km\u00b2. The results also showed that seven dominant ecological factors controlled the distribution of P. heterophylla. These factors included agrotype, the warmest rain, aspect, slope, the warmest and highest temperature, contents of soil organic carbon, and the driest month precipitation. The habitat suitability assessment model based on GIS and Maxent model theory could accurately evaluate the habitat suitability distribution of P. heterophylla in Guizhou. In addition, we recommended Cengong and Zhenyuan county in Guizhou province as the worthy developing potential planting areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Chuan-Zhi", "Initials": "CZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Wei-Ke", "Initials": "WK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Cheng-Hong", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Caryophyllaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Entropy"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28905558", "10.4268/cjcmm20161304"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
