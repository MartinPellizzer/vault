Treatment with ALA (0.2 and 0.4\u00a0mg/ml) significantly reduced total WBC, NO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>3</sub> levels, interstitial fibrosis and emphysema compared to sensitized group. The higher dose of ALA also significantly decreased neutrophil, eosinophil, and monocyte counts, MDA levels and interstitial inflammation but increased lymphocyte counts, as well as antioxidants levels, compared to sensitized group. Dexamethasone administration led to a significant improvement of most factors compared to group S but had no effects on total WBC count, bleeding and epithelial damage.", "Alpha-linolenic acid suppressed inflammation and oxidative stress, making it a potential therapeutic candidate for treatment of airway inflammatory diseases such as bronchial asthma."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Royal Pharmaceutical Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5736-9755"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Boskabady", "ForeName": "Mohammad Hossein", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kaveh", "ForeName": "Mahsa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shakeri", "ForeName": "Farzaneh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammadian Roshan", "ForeName": "Nama", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Research Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rezaee", "ForeName": "Ramin", "Initials": "R"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "910968", "Agency": "Research Council of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0RBV727H71", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Linolenic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7S5I7G3JQL", "NameOfSubstance": "Dexamethasone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9006-59-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Ovalbumin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dexamethasone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ovalbumin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Linolenic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30993723", "10.1111/jphp.13094"]}}]}
