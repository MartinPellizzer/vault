D. huoshanense,as an independent species among many species of Dendrobium,has no experimental studies about its effects on spleen Yin deficiency-type constipation. The purpose of this experiment was to illustrate the therapeutic effect of D. huoshanense on the constipation of spleen Yin deficiency type in rats,investigate its preliminary mechanism,and compare it with the D. officinale and D. nobile contained in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia to clarify its characteristics. The spleen Yin deficiency model was replicated in 70 rats by the composite factor method,and then the model rats were randomly divided into 7 groups: model group,Liuwei Dihuang Pills group( LWDHP),D. huoshanense high( DHS-H),medium( DHS-M),low( DHS-L) dose groups,D. nobile group( DNS),and D. officinale group( DOS),and another 10 rats were used as normal group( Normal). After 7 continuous days of administration,the fecal water content and intestine propulsion rate of each group were detected. HE staining was used to observe the pathological damage of ileum and colon in each group. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to detect aquaporin 3( AQP3) expressions,while the expression levels of the somatostatin( SS) and motilin( MTL) in the ileum of each group were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that as compared with the model group,the rats in each drug-administered group had increased number of fecal pellets,increased fecal water content,and the increased intestinal propulsion rate( P<0. 01),while the pathological damage of the ileum and colon was significantly reduced; the expression of AQP3 protein was significantly decreased( P<0. 01); the level of MTL was significantly increased and the level of SS was decreased( P<0. 01). All DHS groups showed a good dose-effect relationship,and the same dose treatment effect was equivalent to that of DOS,but it was superior to DNS. Therefore,DHS has a significant therapeutic effect on constipation of spleen Yin deficiency type,and its mechanism may be related to intestinal motility and water-liquid metabolism,with a good therapeutic effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy,Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230012,China Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicinal Formula Hefei 230012,China Synergetic Innovation Center of Anhui Authentic Chinese Medicine Quality Hefei 230012,China."}], "LastName": "Gan", "ForeName": "Jiang-Hua", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy,Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230012,China Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicinal Formula Hefei 230012,China Synergetic Innovation Center of Anhui Authentic Chinese Medicine Quality Hefei 230012,China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yu-Fan", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy,Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230012,China Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicinal Formula Hefei 230012,China Synergetic Innovation Center of Anhui Authentic Chinese Medicine Quality Hefei 230012,China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Dai-Yin", "Initials": "DY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy,Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230012,China Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicinal Formula Hefei 230012,China Synergetic Innovation Center of Anhui Authentic Chinese Medicine Quality Hefei 230012,China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Nian-Jun", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy,Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230012,China Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicinal Formula Hefei 230012,China Synergetic Innovation Center of Anhui Authentic Chinese Medicine Quality Hefei 230012,China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Wei-Dong", "Initials": "WD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hefei University of Technology Hefei 230009,China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Jian-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy,Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230012,China Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicinal Formula Hefei 230012,China Synergetic Innovation Center of Anhui Authentic Chinese Medicine Quality Hefei 230012,China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Lan", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Liuwei Dihuang Decoction"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Constipation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intestines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Yin Deficiency"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31359730", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190128.002"]}}]}
