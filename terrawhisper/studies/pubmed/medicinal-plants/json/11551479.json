Using the somatic mutation and recombination test in wing cells of Drosophila melanogaster, an extract of the poblano pepper (Capsicum spp.) was evaluated to determine its antimutagenic effect against the nitrosation process, simulating the process occurring in the human stomach caused by known food additives. Larvae of 72h old D. melanogaster of standard (ST) and high bioactivation (HB) crosses were exposed in a simultaneous, chronic treatment with the juice expressed from the crushed, whole, fresh pepper fruit, plus the mixture of 20mM methyl urea (MU) and sodium nitrite (SN), mixed with the animals' food. Three doses of pepper juice (12.5, 25, and 50%) were used. The background mutation rate given as spots per wing was 0.36 and 0.48 for ST and HB, respectively. Mutation frequencies produced by the MU and SN mixture was 1.73 (ST) and 26.46 (HB) mutations per wing. The poblano juice decreased the above rates between 40 and 80%, respectively. The experiments suggest that some compounds present in the green pepper may cause this antimutagenic effect by interfering with the nitrosation process. The role of the extract and one of its components, such as vitamin C, in the nitrosation process will be discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, M\u00e9xico City, M\u00e9xico. prvirri@ees.eesc.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ramirez-Victoria", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guzman-Rincon", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Espinosa-Aguirre", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murillo-Romero", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylurea Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8M4L3H2ZVZ", "NameOfSubstance": "sodium nitrate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VZ89YBW3P8", "NameOfSubstance": "methylurea"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Drosophila melanogaster"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Methylurea Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrosation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Recombination, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Wings, Animal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11551479", "10.1016/s1383-5718(01)00217-0", "S1383571801002170"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
