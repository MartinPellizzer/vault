Long term usage and over-dosage of diclofenac is associated with adverse effects like drug-induced liver injury, gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. The therapeutic uses of medicinal plants have gained a prominent role in recent years. Madhuca longifolia is a tree found throughout India, which is known to have several pharmacological activities. The aim of our study is to investigate the potential effect of the ethanolic and methanolic leaf extracts of M. longifolia against diclofenac-induced toxicity.", "The rats used for the experiment were divided into seven groups. Group-1 was the normal control. Group-2 was administered with diclofenac (50\u202fmg/kg b.w./day/ip) on the 4<sup>th</sup> and the 5<sup>th</sup> day. Group-3 was treated with diclofenac and ELEML (500\u202fmg/kg b.w./day/po) on all 5 days. Group-4 was treated with diclofenac and MLEML (500\u202fmg/kg b.w./day/po) on all 5 days. Standard drug silymarin (25\u202fmg/kg b.w./day/po) was given to the rats of group-5 along with diclofenac. Group-6 and group-7 were treated with ethanolic leaf extract and methanolic leaf extract of M. longifolia respectively. After the study period, the rats were evaluated for parameters like liver and renal markers, antioxidants and histopathological changes.", "This study has proved the beneficial effect of ethanolic and methanolic leaf extract of M. longifolia against diclofenac-induced toxicity wherein ethanolic leaf extract showed a better result than methanolic leaf extract.", "Our study has concluded the beneficial effect of ethanolic and methonolic leaf extract of Madhuca longifolia against DFC-induced toxicity. This study proves that it has potential effect on hepato, renal and gastro toxicity in female Wistar albino rats. It can further be studied to understand its mechanism in treating toxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.
