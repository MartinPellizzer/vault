Now that these strategies are changing, there are new opportunities for countries like Brazil, in which a large proportion of the world's biodiversity is located. There are, however, new circumstances that must be taken into consideration: material must be collected by groups which are formally authorized to do so and under the conditions of the Convention of Biological Diversity, the discovery process is being successively outsourced to smaller specialized firms and there is a growing integration with producers of cosmetics and phytomedicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Escola de Qu\u00edmica, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 21949-900, Brazil. pseidl@eq.ufrj.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seidl", "ForeName": "Peter R", "Initials": "PR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "An Acad Bras Cienc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503280", "ISSNLinking": "0001-3765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cosmetics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cosmetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11960183", "10.1590/s0001-37652002000100011", "S0001-37652002000100011"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
