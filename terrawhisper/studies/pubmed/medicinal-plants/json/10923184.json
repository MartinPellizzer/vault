Each group was dosed with finely ground, dried, flowering growth stage H perforatum plant material at either 5.7, 4.0, or 2.85 g dry plant per kg live weight. This corresponded to 5.3, 3.7 and 2.65 mg hypericin per kg live weight, respectively.", "The sheep were dosed with a plant slurry by stomach tube and then exposed to bright sunlight for up to 5 h per day over successive days. Their clinical responses were observed and rectal temperature measured.", "Ingestion of H perforatum followed by exposure to bright sunlight frequently resulted in clinical signs attributable to skin irritation and central nervous effects, including an inappropriate increase in body temperature. A decrease in H perforatum ingestion from 5.7 to 2.85 g dry plant per kg live weight and a corresponding decrease in hypericin ingestion from 5.3 to 2.65 mg per kg live weight, was associated with a decrease in the severity of the clinical signs, including the severity of the hyperthermia.", "The rectal temperature rise in affected sheep is a reliable indicator of the early development of an adverse clinical effect. There appears to be an absolute requirement for exposure to bright sunlight before any effects of H perforatum will develop. A single dose of H perforatum remains potentially effective for up to 4 days. In the small group of Merino sheep tested a tolerance level for H perforatum, eaten at the flowering stage, of < 1% (plant wet weight) of body weight and a tolerance level for hypericin of < 2.65 mg per kg live weight, were demonstrated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NSW Agriculture, Orange Agricultural Institute, New South Wales."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bourke", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Aust Vet J", "NlmUniqueID": "0370616", "ISSNLinking": "0005-0423"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Fever"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Sheep Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10923184", "10.1111/j.1751-0813.2000.tb11868.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
