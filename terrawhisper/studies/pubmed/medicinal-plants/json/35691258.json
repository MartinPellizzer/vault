Pistacia atlantica subsp. Kurdica is used by local people for the improvement of lipid and glucose indices. This study was carried out to evaluate clinical effects of P. atlantica subsp. Kurdica on hyperlipidemia related to T2DM patients.", "In this randomized, triple-blind, and placebo-controlled study, type 2 diabetes patients with hyperlipidemia were randomly allocated to receive either P. atlantica kurdica or placebo capsule for 2 months. 58 Patients were followed up at the beginning and after the end of each month for assessment of lipid profiles, glucose indices, and liver and renal function tests. The herbal capsule was standardized according to volatile and nonvolatile compounds by GC-MS/FID and RP-HPLC-PDA, respectively. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents were also determined with a spectrophotometer.", "After 1 and 2 months of the intervention period, mean differences of 2HPP, total cholesterol, and LDL-c have been reduced significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) between the two groups, but there were not reported any significant statistical changes in FBS, HbA1c, TG, HDL-c, ALT, AST, and Cr. The herbal capsule was standardized according to benzoic acid, ballic acid, rutin, and quercetin standard (6.5, 2.1, 1.4, 0.7\u00a0mg, respectively), and also \u03b1-pinene as major volatile constituent 28.51%.", "According to results the P. atlantica kurdica is effective in the improvement of lipid profile and glucose indices in line with its local application.", "(IRCT201708109014N178)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
