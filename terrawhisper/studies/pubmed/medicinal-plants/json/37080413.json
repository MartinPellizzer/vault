Here, we report the cloning and functional characterization of a (R)-\u03b2-bisabolene synthase gene (CcTPS2) from a Lamiaceae medicinal plant Colquhounia coccinea var. mollis. The biochemical function of CcTPS2 catalyzing the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate to form a single product (R)-\u03b2-bisabolene was characterized through an engineered Escherichia coli producing diverse polyprenyl diphosphate precursors and in vitro enzyme assay, indicating that CcTPS2 was a high-fidelity (R)-\u03b2-bisabolene synthase. The production of (R)-\u03b2-bisabolene in an engineered E. coli strain harboring the exogenous mevalonate pathway, farnesyl diphosphate synthase and CcTPS1 genes was 17\u00a0mg/L under shaking flask conditions. Ultimately, 120\u00a0mg of purified (R)-\u03b2-bisabolene was obtained from the engineered E. coli, and its structure was elucidated by detailed spectroscopic analyses (including 1D and 2D NMR, and specific rotation). Four chimeric enzymes were constructed through domain swapping, which altered the product outcome, indicating the region important for substrate and product specificity. In addition, (R)-\u03b2-bisabolene exhibited anti-adipogenic activity in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans and antibacterial activity selectively against Gram-positive bacteria."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
