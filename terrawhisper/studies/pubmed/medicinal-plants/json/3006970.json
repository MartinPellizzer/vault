Treatment of iron malnutrition can be enhanced by an understanding of iron bioavailability from the diet. We have focused on the development of in vitro methods for determining iron bioavailability in the hopes of providing both an understanding of the chemical basis leading to the inhibition or enhancement of iron absorption and the provision of methodologies which will allow nutritionists around the world to ascertain iron bioavailability of local foods and food combinations. The study reported here focuses on the effects of phosvitin, a suspected inhibitor of iron absorption found in egg yolks, on the chemistry of iron during the in vitro enzymatic digestion of pinto beans. Three basic types of information were obtained. First, the total soluble iron was determined during in vitro enzymatic digestion under simulated oral, gastric (pH 2) and duodenal (pH 6) conditions. Phosvitin was found to have a strong solubilizing effect at pH 6 and pH 2 when in the presence of ascorbate. Pyrophosphate also leads to high iron mobilization. A second approach is to determine the static Fe2+ and Fe3+ concentrations following in vitro enzymatic digestion of pinto beans at pH 2 and pH 6. Ascorbic acid enhanced the total soluble iron at both pH values, however, only at pH 2 was a large proportion of the iron found in the Fe2+ state and then only in the presence of phosvitin but not pyrophosphate. A third approach is to determine the amount of Fe2+ formed in the digestive supernatant during a 10-min incubation with ferrozine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Reddy", "ForeName": "M B", "Initials": "MB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chidambaram", "ForeName": "M V", "Initials": "MV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fonseca", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bates", "ForeName": "G W", "Initials": "GW"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "AM-32163", "Acronym": "AM", "Agency": "NIADDK NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Clin Physiol Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "8305885", "ISSNLinking": "0252-1164"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diphosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Egg Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9008-96-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosvitin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestive System Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diphosphates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Duodenum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Egg Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iron Deficiencies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phosvitin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3006970"]}}]}
