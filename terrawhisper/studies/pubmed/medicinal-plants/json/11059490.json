The Ur-3 locus controls hypersensitive resistance (HR) to 44 of the 89 races curated in the United States. To better understand resistance mediated by this locus, we developed new genetic material for analysis. We developed a population of mutagenized seed of cv. Sierra (genotype = Ur-3 ur-4 ur-6) that was screened with a bean rust race that is normally incompatible (HR response) on Ur-3 genotypes. We discovered two mutants of common bean, crg and ur3-delta3, in which uredinia formed on leaves (a compatible interaction) following infection. The F1 generation from a cross of these two mutants expressed the HR response, and the F2 generation segregated in a ratio of 9:7 (HR/uredinia formation). Therefore, the two genes are unlinked. Further genetic analysis determined that the mutation in ur3-delta3 was in the Ur-3 locus, and the mutation in crg was in a newly discovered gene given the symbol Crg (Complements resistance gene). Each mutation was inherited in a recessive manner. Unlike ur3-delta3, crg expressed reduced compatibility to bean rust races 49 and 47 that are normally fully compatible on genotypes, such as Sierra, that are homozygous recessive at the Ur-4 and Ur-6 loci. This suggests a gene mutated in crg is normally a positive compatibility factor for the bean-bean rust interaction. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of crg with primers to common bean resistance gene analogs (RGA) that contain a nucleotide-binding site sequence similar to those found in a number of plant disease resistance genes revealed that crg is missing the SB1 RGA, but not the linked SB3 and SB5 RGAs. Genetic analyses revealed that Crg cosegregates with the SB1 RGA. These results demonstrate that Crg is located near a RGA cluster in the common bean genome."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, North Dakota State University, Fargo 58105, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kalavacharia", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stavely", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Myers", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McClean", "ForeName": "P E", "Initials": "PE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Plant Microbe Interact", "NlmUniqueID": "9107902", "ISSNLinking": "0894-0282"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Basidiomycota"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Mapping"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Fungal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Complementation Test"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11059490", "10.1094/MPMI.2000.13.11.1237"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
