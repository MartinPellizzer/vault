Their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analyses and by comparison of their NMR data with those of related compounds. Furthermore, the structures of 1 and 3 - 5 were confirmed by X-ray single-crystal diffraction analyses. Compounds 4 and 5 exhibited weak cytotoxic activities against the MCF-7, HeLa, and A549 cell lines. Compounds 3 - 5 were also evaluated for their inhibitory effects against HIV lytic replication."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hainnan Normal University, Haikou, 571158, P.
