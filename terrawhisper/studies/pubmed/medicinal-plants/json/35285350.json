Owing to the extreme abiotic and biotic stressful conditions they thrive in, these plants produce unique compounds with promising pharmacological propensities. Mangroves are inhabited by an astronomical number of fungal communities which produce a diverse array of extracellular degradative enzymes, namely: amylase, cellulase, xylanase, pectinase, cholesterol oxidase, etc. Such enzymes can be isolated from the mangrove fungi and harnessed for different biotechnological applications, for example, as replacements for chemical catalysts. Mangrove microbes attract considerable attention as they shelter the largest group of marine microorganisms that are resistant to extreme conditions and can produce novel biogenic substances. Vaccines developed from mangrove microbes may promise a safe future by developing effective immunization procedures with a minimum of economic burden. Interestingly, mangroves offer an exciting opportunity for synthesizing nanoparticles in a greener way as these plants are naturally rich in phytochemicals. <i>Rhizophora mucronata</i> Lam., <i>Avicennia officinalis</i> L. and <i>Excoecaria agallocha</i> L. are capable of synthesizing nanoparticles which have evolved recently as an alternative in various industries and are used for their biomedical application. Besides, the phytoconstituents isolated from mangrove plants, such as: gallic acid, galactose, lupeol, catechins, carotenoids, etc., were explored for various biological activities. These compounds are used in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries to produce antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer, antidiabetic, and other therapeutic agents. The present review provides information on the biotechnological potentials of mangrove plants and their bioactive compounds as a new source of novel drugs, enzymes, nanoparticles and therapeutically important microbial pigments. Thus, this review forms a base of support and hasten the urgent research on biomedical applications of mangroves."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0602-0059"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Mauritius, R\u00e9duit, Mauritius."}], "LastName": "Sadeer", "ForeName": "Nabeelah Bibi", "Initials": "NB"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6548-7823"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Science Faculty, Selcuk University, Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Zengin", "ForeName": "Gokhan", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3962-8666"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Mauritius, R\u00e9duit, Mauritius."}], "LastName": "Mahomoodally", "ForeName": "Mohamad Fawzi", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8505177", "ISSNLinking": "0738-8551"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Avicennia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizophoraceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "41"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35285350", "10.1080/07388551.2022.2033682"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
