Animal were divided into nine groups; each group consists of six animals. The groups were : group I was untreated and kept as control, group II was treated with CCl<sub>4</sub> only, group III (silymarin with CCl<sub>4</sub>); group IV (Per-1 100\u2009mg/kg with CCl<sub>4</sub>);group V (Per-1 200\u2009mg/kg with CCl<sub>4</sub>); group VI (Per-2 100\u2009mg/kg with CCl<sub>4</sub>); group VII (Per-2 200\u2009mg/kg with CCl<sub>4</sub>); group VIII (Per-3 100\u2009mg/kg with CCl<sub>4</sub>); and group IX (Per-3 200\u2009mg/kg with CCl<sub>4</sub>). Silymarin was used as standard drug. All tested fractions were found active (except Per-1 at low dose of 100\u2009mg/kg) with significant value (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) compared to CCl<sub>4</sub> only group. Serum creatinine, malondialdehyde (MDA), and uric acid were significantly (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) lowered in group VII-IX as compared to CCl<sub>4</sub> only group. Similarly, total protein (TP) and non-protein sulfhydryls(NP-SH) level in kidney tissues were significantly (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) elevated in the same groups compared to CCl<sub>4</sub> only group. Further to check the cardio-protective potential, biochemical parameters such as LDH, creatine kinase, TP, MDA, and NP-SH levels in myocardial tissues were also estimated.These findings confirmed that the n-butanol and aqueous fractions are active and recommended for further bioactive phytoconstituents screening. Repeated column chromatography on silica gel G and sephadex-LH-20 of the active n-butanol fraction, four flavonoids were isolated. Based on the spectroscopic NMR data, compounds were identified as kaempferol (<b>1</b>), quercetin (<b>2</b>), astragalin (<b>3)</b>, and rutin (<b>4</b>)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0456-3196"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry of Medicinal Plants Department, National Research Centre, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Shahat", "ForeName": "Abdelaaty A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Medicinal, Aromatic and Poisonous Plants Research Centre (MAPRC), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Government College Ara Khel FR, Kohat, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ullah", "ForeName": "Riaz", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Medicinal, Aromatic and Poisonous Plants Research Centre (MAPRC), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alqahtani", "ForeName": "Ali S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry of Medicinal Plants Department, National Research Centre, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hassanein", "ForeName": "Heba M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Misr University for Science and Technology (MUST), Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Husseiny", "ForeName": "Husseiny A", "Initials": "HA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, College of Science and Arts, Shaqra University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, University of Technological Science, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Mohammed", "ForeName": "Nahla M", "Initials": "NM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Medicinal, Aromatic and Poisonous Plants Research Centre (MAPRC), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Herqash", "ForeName": "Rashed N", "Initials": "RN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Silymarin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8PJ61P6TS3", "NameOfSubstance": "1-Butanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CL2T97X0V0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "1-Butanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Diospyros"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silymarin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Switzerland"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33522322", "10.1080/01480545.2020.1849269"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
