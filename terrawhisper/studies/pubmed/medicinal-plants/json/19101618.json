Data on medicinal uses were obtained from fifteen local Quechua participants, eight of them being traditional healers.", "Contingency table and binomial analyses of medicinal plants used versus the total number of inventoried species per family showed that Solanaceae is significantly overused in traditional medicine, whereas Poaceae is underused. Also plants with a shrubby habitat are significantly overrepresented in the medicinal plant inventory, which most likely relates to their year-round availability to people as compared to most annual plants that disappear in the dry season. Our ranking of medicinal species according to cultural importance is based upon the Quality Use Agreement Value (QUAV) index we developed. This index takes into account (1) the average number of medicinal uses reported for each plant species by participants; (2) the perceived quality of those medicinal uses; and (3) participant consensus.", "According to the results, the QUAV index provides an easily derived and valid appraisal of a medicinal plant's cultural significance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Tropical and Subtropical Agriculture and Ethnobotany, Ghent University, Coupure links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium. evert.thomas@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "Evert", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vandebroek", "ForeName": "Ina", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sanca", "ForeName": "Sabino", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van Damme", "ForeName": "Patrick", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bolivia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indians, South American"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19101618", "10.1016/j.jep.2008.11.021", "S0378-8741(08)00658-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
