This study aimed to investigate HPLC analysis, antioxidant activity, and wound-healing effect of <i>Echium amoenum (EA)</i> on rats. The <i>EA</i> was analysed for the determination of shikonin a derivative of naphthoquinone. In the wound healing assessment, forty Wistar rats were divided into five groups that were receiving the cream base, normal saline (NS), 1% silver sulfadiazine (SSD), and 5 and 10% <i>EA</i> cream (EAC). Shikonin was found in the EA extract. The average wound area on the 10th day was 0.71\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01, 0.86\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13, 0.58\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08, 0.53\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 and 0.43\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04\u2009cm<sup>2</sup> for the cream base, NS, SSD, and 5 and 10% EAC, respectively. The collagen fibres were well formed and horizontally oriented in 5 and 10% EAC groups compared to other groups. <i>EA</i> cream was an effective treatment for wound healing in comparison with SSD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abd Haghighi", "ForeName": "Mohammad Javad", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Azadbakht", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Habibi", "ForeName": "Emran", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vahedi", "ForeName": "Lale", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiopharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseinimehr", "ForeName": "Seyed Jalal", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39066567", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2384079"]}}]}
