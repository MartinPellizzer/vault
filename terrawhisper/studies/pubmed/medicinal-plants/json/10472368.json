However, none of the currently used antileprosy drugs has been reported to have a positive effect in wound healing. Anecdotal reports claim that leprosy patients who have taken capsules containing oil of hydnocarpus orally have shown more rapid wound healing than those not receiving it. In view of these reports, a pilot experimental study was undertaken to determine the effect of the oil of hydnocarpus in wounds experimentally inflicted on male Wistar rats. The wound-healing effect of oil of hydnocarpus was studied with reference to collagenation and the strength of the scar tissue. The drug-treated group showed a significant increase in body weight and strength of scar tissue in the incision model and, also, increased strength of the collagen tissue and hydroxyproline content in the dead space model. The results of this pilot study indicate that the oil of hydnocarpus, which also has antileprotic activity, could be a useful adjunct in the healing of wounds and ulcers in leprosy patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oommen", "ForeName": "S T", "Initials": "ST"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Raju", "ForeName": "C V", "Initials": "CV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Lepr Other Mycobact Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "8505819", "ISSNLinking": "0148-916X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polypropylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8001-74-9", "NameOfSubstance": "chaulmoogra oil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Foreign Bodies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polypropylenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wounds, Penetrating"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10472368"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
