Current treatment options, such as antibiotics and intestinal resections, often result in complications related to pediatric nutrition and development. This systematic review aimed to identify alternative dietary bioactive compounds that have shown promising outcomes in ameliorating NEC <i>in vivo</i> studies conducted within the past six years. Following PRISMA guidelines and registering in PROSPERO (CRD42023330617), we conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Our analysis included 19 studies, predominantly involving <i>in vivo</i> models of rats (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) and mice (<i>Mus musculus</i>). The findings revealed that various types of compounds have demonstrated successful amelioration of NEC symptoms. Specifically, six studies employed plant phenolics, seven utilized plant metabolites/cytotoxic chemicals, three explored the efficacy of vitamins, and three investigated the potential of whole food extracts. Importantly, all administered compounds exhibited positive effects in mitigating the disease. These results highlight the potential of natural cytotoxic chemicals derived from medicinal plants in identifying and implementing powerful alternative drugs and therapies for NEC. Such approaches have the capacity to impact multiple pathways involved in the development and progression of NEC symptoms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA."}], "LastName": "Kolba", "ForeName": "Nikolai", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA."}], "LastName": "Tako", "ForeName": "Elad", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "22"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "22"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37971890", "10.1080/10408398.2023.2281623"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
