Identification was performed by HPLC and diode array detection as well as by monitoring the HPLC fractions by TLC and MS. Using santonin as internal standard, HPLC separations were achieved with a methanol-water gradient system using RP 8 LiChrospher 100 (5 microm) as stationary phase. For validation, sample analyses were performed, using the two tetraploid species A. collina and A. pratensis. The method allows the identification and quantification of the main compounds achillicin, 8alpha-tigloxy-artabsin, 8alpha-angeloxy-artabsin, arglanin and santamarin with variation coefficients between 3.4 and 4.7% (total content) using santonin as internal standard. For the different compounds recovery was found between 81 and 107% performing multiple analyses of A. collina and A. pratensis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacognosy, University of Vienna, Pharmaziezentrum, Austria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Glasl", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kastner", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jurenitsch", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kubelka", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr B Biomed Sci Appl", "NlmUniqueID": "9714109", "ISSNLinking": "1387-2273"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10410963", "10.1016/s0378-4347(99)00134-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
