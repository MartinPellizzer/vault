From a bioassay-guided fractionation procedure, PS-A-6 was isolated from Psychotria serpens (P. serpens), which suppressed HSV-1 multiplication in Vero cells without apparent cytotoxicity. Time-of-addition experiments suggested that the inhibitory action of PS-A-6 on HSV-1 replication was not through blocking of virus adsorption. In an attempt to further localize the point in the HSV-1 replication cycle where arrest occurred, a set of key regulatory events leading to viral multiplication was examined, including viral gene expression, DNA replication, and structural protein synthesis. The results indicated that gB mRNA and protein expression in Vero cells were impeded by PS-A-6. Southern blot analysis showed that HSV-1 DNA replication in Vero cells was arrested by PS-A-6. In addition, PS-A-6 decreased thymidine kinase (tk) and ICP27 mRNA expression in the cells. The mechanisms of antiviral action of PS-A-6 seem to be mediated, at least in part, through inhibition of early transcripts of HSV-1, such as tk and ICP27 mRNAs, arresting HSV-1 DNA synthesis and gB gene expression in Vero cells. Plans are underway for the isolation of pure compounds from PS-A-6 and elucidation of their mechanism of action."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, No. 155-1, Sec. 2, Li-Nung St. Shih-Pai, 112, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC. kuo9111@cma23.nricm.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuo", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ho", "ForeName": "Y H", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Antiviral Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8109699", "ISSNLinking": "0166-3542"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ICP27 protein, human herpesvirus 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immediate-Early Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Envelope Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "glycoprotein B, Simplexvirus"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Northern"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorocebus aethiops"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Replication"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Herpesvirus 1, Human"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Immediate-Early Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vero Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Viral Envelope Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Replication"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11431035", "10.1016/s0166-3542(01)00141-3", "S0166-3542(01)00141-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
