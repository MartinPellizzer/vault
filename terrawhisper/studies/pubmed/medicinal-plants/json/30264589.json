The present study evaluated the protective effect of naringin against cardiotoxicity induced by BPA. Male Wistar rats were divided into six groups. Control group received oral olive oil; and BPA group orally were administrated 50\u2009mg/kg of BPA for 30\u00a0d consecutively to induce toxicity. 40, 80, and 160\u2009mg/kg of naringin were orally administered for 30 consecutive, along with BPA. Naringin group orally received 160\u2009mg/kg of naringin for 30\u00a0d consecutively. Animals were sacrificed and their biochemical, histological, and oxidative stress parameters were measured 24\u2009h after the last treatment. Heart injury was induced by BPA as an evidence with a significant increase in levels of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase-MB, triglyceride, lipid peroxidation, and a significant decrease in levels of glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase and triggered myocardial disorganization, myofibrillar loss, congestion of red blood cells, and the inflammation. However, there were not any changes in the total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and alanine aminotransferase. Moreover, our results indicated that administering 80 and 160\u2009mg/kg of naringin significantly altered all examined endpoints that were induced by BPA. Both concentrations of 80 and 160\u2009mg/kg of naringin were more effective than 40\u2009mg/kg. These findings indicated that naringin had a protective effect against cardiotoxicity induced by BPA through lipid-lowering properties, antioxidant activity, and suppressed lipid peroxidation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khodayar", "ForeName": "Mohammad Javad", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kalantari", "ForeName": "Heibatollah", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahdavinia", "ForeName": "Masoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khorsandi", "ForeName": "Layasadat", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Student Research Committee, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alboghobeish", "ForeName": "Soheila", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Student Research Committee, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Samimi", "ForeName": "Azin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Student Research Committee, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alizadeh", "ForeName": "Saeid", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Student Research Committee, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zeidooni", "ForeName": "Leila", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MLT3645I99", "NameOfSubstance": "bisphenol A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N7TD9J649B", "NameOfSubstance": "naringin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Benzhydryl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiotoxicity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavanones"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30264589", "10.1080/01480545.2018.1504958"]}}]}
