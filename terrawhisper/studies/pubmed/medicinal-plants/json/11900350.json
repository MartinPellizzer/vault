Its mechanism of action is considered to be the inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB, a potent inducer of HIV-1 gene expression. In this study, we have synthesized 96 derivatives of cepharanoline, including cepharanthine, and examined their inhibitory effects on HIV-1 replication in U1 cells. Among the 12-O-alkyl derivatives, cepharanthine proved to be the most active, and the activity decreased as the length of the alkyl chain increased. All of the 12-O-acyl derivatives were totally inactive, while a few 12-O-carbamoyl derivatives displayed modest activity. Since 12-O-ethyl derivatives were found to be as active as cepharanthine against HIV-1 replication, we further synthesized various 12-O-ethyl derivatives of cepharanoline. Among the derivatives, five proved to be more active inhibitors than cepharanthine, and the most active compound was 12-O-ethylpiperazinyl cepharanoline. The 50% effective concentrations of this compound and cepharanthine were 0.0041 and 0.028 microg/ml (0.0060 and 0.046 microM), respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Human Retroviruses, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan. baba@m.kufm.kagoshima-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baba", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okamoto", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kashiwaba", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ono", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Antivir Chem Chemother", "NlmUniqueID": "9009212", "ISSNLinking": "0956-3202"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-HIV Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzylisoquinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7592YJ0J6T", "NameOfSubstance": "cepharanthine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-HIV Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzylisoquinolines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "HIV"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Monocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Stem Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Replication"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11900350", "10.1177/095632020101200506"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
