Kinin actions are mediated by specific membrane receptors and involve a complex signal transducer and also second messenger mechanisms. Due to its inequivocal relevance, an intensive effort has been focused in recent years to develop selective and competitive BK antagonists. Thus, the development of a new series of peptide BK antagonists has made an important contribution to the understanding of the pharmacological, physiological and pathophysiological role of BK, and this is certain to provide a firm basis for developing new drugs to relieve pain and inflammation. However, BK antagonists derived from peptide origin reported to date have limited clinical use due to their poor oral absorbtion and short duration of effect. Thus, considerable effort has also been made in developing stable nonpeptide BK antagonists. Up to now, most nonpeptide compounds reported to exhibit BK antagonistic activity have been derived from plants, including many flavonoids, terpenes, and also synthetic substances with various molecular structures. Amongst them, the pregnane glycoside compounds isolated from the plant Mandevilla velutina are the most promising. These compounds are effective in antagonizing BK responses in a variety of preparations, and they also exhibit potent and long-lasting analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities. The exact mechanism underlying their action however, is not yet completely understood."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Farmacologia, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, Brasil."}], "LastName": "Calixto", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yunes", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz", "NlmUniqueID": "7502619", "ISSNLinking": "0074-0276"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Steroids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S8TIM42R2W", "NameOfSubstance": "Bradykinin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Bradykinin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Steroids"}], "NumberOfReferences": "48"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1842001", "10.1590/s0074-02761991000600045", "S0074-02761991000600045"]}}]}
