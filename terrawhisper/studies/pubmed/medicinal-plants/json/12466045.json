The cardiovascular pharmacological effects and the mechanism of actions of these compounds were reviewed. Tetrandrine isolated from Stephania tetrandra S Moore possesses antihypertensive and antiarrhythmic effects. The antihypertensive effects of tetrandrine have been demonstrated in experimental hypertensive animals and in hypertensive patients. Recent studies showed that in addition to its calcium antagonistic effect, tetrandrine interacted with M receptors. Modulation by M receptor is one of the pharmacological mechanisms of cardiovascular effects of tetrandrine. Dauricine and daurisoloine were isolated from Menispermum dauricum DC. The antiarrhythmic effects of dauricine have been verified in different experimental arrhythmic models and in cardiac arrhythmic patients. Dauricine blocked the cardiac transmembrane Na+,K+ and Ca2+ ion currents. Differing from quinidine and sotalol, which exhibited reverse use-dependent effect, dauricine prolonged APD in a normal use-dependent manner in experimental studies. The antiarrhythmic effect of daurisoline and neferine which is an alkaloid isolated from Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn, and their mechanisms of actions have also been studied. The antiarrhythmic effect of daurisoline is more potent than that of dauricine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacology, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China. qianjq_tjmc@hotmail.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Jia-Qing", "Initials": "JQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Arrhythmia Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzylisoquinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Channel Blockers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoquinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetrahydroisoquinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2292-16-2", "NameOfSubstance": "neferine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "29EX23D5AJ", "NameOfSubstance": "tetrandrine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8QTO90G5W5", "NameOfSubstance": "dauricine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Arrhythmia Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzylisoquinolines"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Channel Blockers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular System"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Isoquinolines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Stephania"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tetrahydroisoquinolines"}], "NumberOfReferences": "45"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12466045"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
