Oral administration of UL-409 at a dose of 600 mg/kg significantly prevented the occurrence of cold-restraint stress induced ulcerations. It significantly inhibited gastric ulceration induced by alcohol and aspirin, as well as cysteamine and histamine induced duodenal ulcers in rats and guinea pigs, respectively. The volume and acidity of gastric juice in pyloric ligated rats was reduced by UL-409. It also significantly, and dose dependently, promoted gastric mucus secretion in normal as well as in stress, drug and alcohol induced ulceration in animals. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that UL-409 possesses antiulcer activity and that the observed activity may be due to the modulation of defensive factors by improvement in gastric cytoprotection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "R&D Centre, Himalaya Drug Co., Makali, Bangalore, India."}], "LastName": "Mitra", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gopumadhavan", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hemavathi", "ForeName": "T S", "Initials": "TS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Muralidhar", "ForeName": "T S", "Initials": "TS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Venkataranganna", "ForeName": "M V", "Initials": "MV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Duodenal Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8771458", "10.1016/0378-8741(95)01414-4", "0378874195014144"]}}]}
