The five compounds examined were alpha-amyrin (A), uvaol (UV), ursolic acid (UA), 19 alpha-hydroxy ursolic acid (HU) and 19 alpha,24-dihydroxy ursolic acid (DHU).", "When the cells were preincubated with these compounds, the superoxide generation induced by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) was significantly suppressed in a concentration-dependent manner. These compounds also suppressed the superoxide generation induced by arachidonic acid (AA) in high concentrations. In the case of the superoxide generation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), UA, HU and DHU suppressed the superoxide generation but A and UV gave no effect. When the cells were incubated with fMLP in UA, HU and DHU, fMLP-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of 45 kDa proteins of the cells was dose-dependently suppressed in parallel to the suppression of fMLP-induced superoxide generation.", "Triterpenoid compounds suppress stimulus-induced superoxide generation and tyrosyl phosphorylation and may have pharmaceutical applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, No. 103, Wenhua Road, Shenyang 110015, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Guang", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Huangwei", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chunlei", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamashita", "ForeName": "Koichi", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manabe", "ForeName": "Masanobu", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Suixu", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kodama", "ForeName": "Hiroyuki", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Clin Chim Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "1302422", "ISSNLinking": "0009-8981"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Diospyros"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11983195", "10.1016/s0009-8981(02)00021-9", "S0009898102000219"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
