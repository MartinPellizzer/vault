The antioxidant activity and acute toxicity of these extracts were also evaluated.", "The plant extracts antibacterial activity was evaluated in vitro and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the broth micro-dilution assay. The bacterial killing kinetic was also evaluated for all extracts. In addition, the antibacterial effect of the extracts was tested in vitro on artificial oral biofilms. The acute toxicity of each extract was determined in according to Lorke [Lorke D. A new approach to practical acute toxicity testing. Arch Toxicol 1983;54:275-87] and the antioxidant activity was evaluated by DPPH photometric assay [Mensor LL, Menezes FS, Leit\u00e3o GG, Reis AS, Santos TC, Coube CS, et al. Screening of Brazilian plants extract for antioxidant activity by the use of DPPH free radical method. Phytother Res 2001;15:127-30].", "MIC and the bactericidal concentrations were identical, for each evaluated extract. However, microbes of artificial biofilms were less sensitive to the extracts than the planktonic strains. A. cymbifera extract induced the highest bactericidal effect against all tested bacteria, followed by C. nucifera, Z. joazeiro and C. pyramidalis extracts, respectively. All extracts showed good antioxidant potential, being C. nucifera and C. pyramidalis aqueous extracts the most active ones.", "In conclusion, all oral bacteria tested (planktonic or in artificial biofilms) were more susceptible to, and rapidly killed in presence of A. cymbifera, C. pyramidalis and C. nucifera than Z. joazeiro extracts, respectively. Thus, these extracts may be of great interest for future studies about treatment of oral diseases, considering their potent antioxidant activity and low toxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Ortodontia, Faculdade de Odontologia, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alviano", "ForeName": "Wagner S", "Initials": "WS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alviano", "ForeName": "Daniela S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Diniz", "ForeName": "Cl\u00e1udio G", "Initials": "CG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Antoniolli", "ForeName": "Angelo R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alviano", "ForeName": "Celuta S", "Initials": "CS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Farias", "ForeName": "Luiz M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carvalho", "ForeName": "Maria Auxiliadora R", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Souza", "ForeName": "Margareth M G", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bolognese", "ForeName": "Ana Maria", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Arch Oral Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0116711", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9969"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Structures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18243157", "10.1016/j.archoralbio.2007.12.001", "S0003-9969(07)00316-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
