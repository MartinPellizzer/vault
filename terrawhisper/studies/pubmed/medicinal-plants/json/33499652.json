The identification of differentially expressed proteins, such as relapse and drug resistance proteins involved in leukemia by using various ionization sources and mass analyzers of mass spectrometry techniques, has helped scientists find better diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment strategies. With the aid of this powerful analytical technique, we can investigate the qualification/quantification of proteins, protein-protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and find the correlation between proteins and their genes with the hope of finding the missing parts of the successful therapy puzzle. In this review, we followed different MS sources and analyzers which used for monitoring various type of leukemia, then focused on MALDI-TOF MS as a quick and reliable method for studying proteins. Due to several review published for other techniques, the present review is the first work in this field. Also, by classifying more than 400 proteins, we have found 42 proteins are involved in two or three different stages of leukemia. Finally, we have suggested six specific biomarkers for AML, one for ALL, three biomarkers with a role in the etiology of leukemia and 13 markers with the potential for further studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fasih Ramandi", "ForeName": "Negin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pediatric Growth and Development Research Center, Institute of Endocrinology, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Faranoush", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghassempour", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0249-7009"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry Department, Pharmaceutical and Drug Industries Research Division, National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Aboul-Enein", "ForeName": "Hassan Y", "Initials": "HY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9004784", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8347"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteome"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Proteome"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Proteomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33499652", "10.1080/10408347.2021.1871844"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
