In the experiment, Raman spectras of 67 batch of sample including Otolithum Sciaenae, Galaxeae Os, Ophicalcitum, Calcite, Stalactite and their mixture which had different content of CaCO3 were collected, and the quantitative models were established by using an improved siPLS to optimize the characteristic spectral bands and using the CaCO3 contents which were measured by EDTA titration method as references. Compared with the results by EDTA titration, the established quantitative model for CaCO, content showed a prediction result that the average relative deviation of the prediction results is 2. 71% and the average recovery rate was 100.46%, when the content is between 0.465 4-0.999 7, and when the characteristic spectral bands of 1 290-1 280, 730-714, 700-690, 660-650, 465-460, 455-445, 405-385 cm(-1) had been optimized. The result also showed that the model using Raman spectroscopy and based on an improved siPLS can get a rapid determination for contents of 5 kinds of Traditional Chinese Medicine containing CaCO3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Long", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Ming-yang", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ming", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yi-mei", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Bi-sheng", "Initials": "BS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ke-li", "Initials": "KL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H0G9379FGK", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Carbonate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Carbonate"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Least-Squares Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrum Analysis, Raman"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26983209"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
