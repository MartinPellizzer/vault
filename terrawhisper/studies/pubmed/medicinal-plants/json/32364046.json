In the cholinergic hypothesis, dysfunction of cholinergic neurons especially in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex contributes to cognitive decline in patients. So agents that enhance acetylcholine concentration could improve cognitive function. AChEIs are among the most studied anti-Alzheimer agents. Galbanic acid as a natural compound with a sesquiterpene coumarin scaffold is a weak inhibitor of AChE. In the present contribution, we discussed the impact of carboxylic group ionization on inhibitory effects. We performed <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in silico</i> studies on galbanic acid, methyl and ethyl galbanates as AChE inhibitors. The order of inhibitory effect on AChE was obtained as ethyl galbanate\u2009\u223c\u2009methyl galbanate\u2009>\u2009galbanic acid. Our study highlights the important role of the physicochemical properties of natural lead compounds in each specific assay.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
