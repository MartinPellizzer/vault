The oxidative enzymes, As accumulation in different tissues, plant growth, and content of pharmacologically important ent-labdane-related diterpenes (ent-LRDs) of the two genotypes were evaluated in the study. Results demonstrated that As uptake significantly reduced plant biomass in APw<sub>C</sub> and AP<sub>MS</sub> by 5-41.5% and 9-33% in a dose-response manner, respectively. The AP<sub>MS</sub> exhibited lower bioconcentration and translocation factors, higher As tolerance index, and higher content of ent-LRDs as compared to AP<sub>WC</sub>. As treatment induced a decrease in the sum of four metabolite content of AP<sub>MS</sub> (1.43 times) and an increase in that of AP<sub>WC</sub> (1.12 times) as compared to control. Likewise, variance in the production of 5,7,2',3'-tetramethoxyflavanone, and stress enzymes was also observed between APw<sub>C</sub> and AP<sub>MS</sub>. The increase in the expression of ApCPS2 suggested its involvement in channeling of metabolic flux towards the biosynthesis of ent-LRDs under As stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
