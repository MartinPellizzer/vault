Both the flavor and medicinal properties of Allium plants are attributed to a wide variety of sulfur-containing compounds that are generated from S-alk(en)ylcysteine sulfoxides. Previous radiotracer experiments proposed that S-alk(en)ylcysteine sulfoxides are biosynthesized from glutathione. The recent identification of \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidases and a flavin-containing S-oxygenase involved in the biosynthesis of S-allylcysteine sulfoxide (alliin) in garlic (Allium sativum) provided insights into the reaction order of deglutamylation and S-oxygenation together with the localization of the biosynthesis, although the rest of the enzymes in the pathway still await discovery. In intact plants, S-alk(en)ylcysteine sulfoxides are stored in the cytosol of storage mesophyll cells. During tissue damage, the vacuolar enzyme alliinase contacts and hydrolyzes S-alk(en)ylcysteine sulfoxides to produce the corresponding sulfenic acids, which are further converted into various sulfur-containing bioactive compounds mainly via spontaneous reactions. The formed sulfur-containing compounds exhibit bioactivities related to pathogen defense, the prevention and alleviation of cancer and cardiovascular diseases, and neuroprotection. This review summarizes the current understanding of the occurrence, biosynthesis, and alliinase-triggered chemical conversion of S-alk(en)ylcysteine sulfoxides in Allium plants as well as the impact of S-alk(en)ylcysteine sulfoxides and their derivatives on medicinal, food, and agricultural sciences."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.
