Our previous screening of medicinal plants showed that methanol (MeOH) extract of Forsythiae Fructus had significant anti-inflammatory activity, but the active ingredients remain unclear. For isolation of active ingredient of MeOH extract of Forsythiae Fructus, it was partitioned with n-hexane and ethylacetate (EtOAc), and arctigenin was isolated from EtOAc fraction by column chromatography with anti-inflammatory activity-guided separation. Its activity was evaluated in the animal models of inflammation including myeloperoxidase (MPO) and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) activities in the edematous tissues homogenate, and silica-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the RAW 264.7 cell line. It was shown that arctigenin (100 mg/kg) had significantly decreased not only carrageenan-induced paw edema 3 and 4h after injection of carrageenan, arachidonic acid (AA)-induced ear edema at a painting dose of 0.1-1.0mg/ear, and acetic acid-induced writhing response and acetic acid-induced capillary permeability accentuation at an oral dose of 25-100, and 100 mg/kg, respectively, but also MPO and EPO activities at a painting dose of 0.1-1.0mg/ear in the AA-induced edematous tissues homogenate as indicators of neutrophils and eosinophils recruitment into the inflamed tissue. Further, arctigenin (0.1-10 microM) also significantly inhibited the intracellular ROS production by silica. These results indicate that arctigenin is a bioactive agent of Forsythiae Fructus having significant anti-inflammatory action by inhibition of the exudation, and leukocytes recruitment into the inflamed tissues. The pharmacologic mechanism of action of arctigenin may be due to the inhibition of release/production of inflammatory mediators such as AA metabolites and free radicals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pathophysiology and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, 221 Huksuk-dong, Dongjak-Ku, Seoul 156-756, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Hyo Sook", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Ji Yun", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Chang Jong", "Initials": "CJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Furans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Eosinophil Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U76MR9VS6M", "NameOfSubstance": "arctigenin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Eosinophil Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Forsythia"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Furans"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lignans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrum Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18180122", "10.1016/j.jep.2007.11.030", "S0378-8741(07)00635-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
