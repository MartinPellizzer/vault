The synthesized silane featured alkoxysilyl groups, facilitating permanent bonds with the cotton fabric surface via hydrolysis. Cotton fabrics were modified using silane solutions of varying concentrations (2.5\u202f%, 5\u202f%, and 10\u202f%) through a dip-coating process to determine the effect of the modifier amount on fabric properties. The modified fabrics were subjected to FT-IR, TGA, SEM, and EDS analyses, as well as microcalorimetric and LOI tests, to assess changes in flammability. FT-IR, SEM/EDS, and add-on analyses confirmed effective coverage of the cotton fabric with the flame retardant. Thermogravimetric tests indicated a significant reduction in the mass loss rate during thermal degradation. LOI analyses demonstrated a decrease in flammability (increase in LOI value), while microcalorimetric tests showed a substantial decrease in the heat release rate, correlating with increased modifier concentration on the fabric surface. Post-washing analyses revealed that, although some of the modifier was washed out, the samples still retained reduced flammability."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
