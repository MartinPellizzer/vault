An earlier report has shown that exogenous DNase 1 offers protection against such severe local tissue necrosis. Tricosanthus tricuspidata is a medicinal plant and the paste prepared from its leaves has been used extensively for the treatment of snakebite-induced tissue necrosis. Most studies including reports from our laboratory focused on plant secondary metabolite as therapeutic molecules against snakebite envenomation. However, the involvement of hydrolytic enzymes including DNase in treating snake venom-induced tissue necrosis has not been addressed. Several folk medicinal plants used against snakebite treatment showed the presence of DNase activity and found to be rich in T.\u00a0tricuspidata. Further, purified T.\u00a0tricuspidata DNase showed a single sharp peak in reversed-phase high-performance\u00a0liquid chromatography\u00a0(RP-HPLC) with an apparent molecular mass of 17\u2009kDa. T.\u00a0tricuspidata DNase exhibited potent DNA degrading activity performed using agarose gel electrophoresis, spectrophotometric assay, and DNA zymography. In addition, purified DNase from T.\u00a0tricuspidata was able to neutralize E.\u00a0carinatus venom-induced mouse tail tissue necrosis and normalized elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels 30\u2009minutes post venom injection. T.\u00a0tricuspidata DNase was also able to reverse E.\u00a0carinatus venom-induced histopathological changes and collagen depletion in mice tail tissue. All these observed pharmacological actions of T.\u00a0tricuspidata DNase were inhibited by sodium fluoride (NaF). This study provides scientific validation of the traditional use of T.\u00a0tricuspidata leaf paste in the healing of snakebite-induced tissue necrosis and might be exploited to treat snake venom-induced local toxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Studies in Biochemistry, University of Mysore, Manasagangothri, Mysuru, India."}], "LastName": "Rudresha", "ForeName": "Gotravalli V", "Initials": "GV"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7818-2460"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Studies in Biochemistry, University of Mysore, Manasagangothri, Mysuru, India."}], "LastName": "Urs", "ForeName": "Amog P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Studies in Biochemistry, University of Mysore, Manasagangothri, Mysuru, India."}], "LastName": "Manjuprasanna", "ForeName": "Vaddarahally N", "Initials": "VN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Studies in Biochemistry, University of Mysore, Manasagangothri, Mysuru, India."}], "LastName": "Suvilesh", "ForeName": "Kanve N", "Initials": "KN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Studies in Bioscience, University of Mysore, Hemagangothri, Hassan, India."}], "LastName": "Sharanappa", "ForeName": "Puttappa", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3284-4163"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Studies in Biochemistry, University of Mysore, Manasagangothri, Mysuru, India."}], "LastName": "Vishwanath", "ForeName": "Bannikuppe S", "Initials": "BS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "8205768", "ISSNLinking": "0730-2312"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen Type I"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viper Venoms"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8ZYQ1474W7", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Fluoride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Creatine Kinase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.21.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Deoxyribonuclease I"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen Type I"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Creatine Kinase"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Cucurbitaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Deoxyribonuclease I"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Necrosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Snake Bites"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Fluoride"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Viper Venoms"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Viperidae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30506919", "10.1002/jcb.28115"]}}]}
