Natural killer (NK) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cytotoxicity against HCMV-infected cells was greatly enhanced in the presence of rhamnogalacturonan (500 ng/ml). The increase of the multiplicity of infection from MOI 0.1 to 1.0 had only a slight effect on cytotoxicity enhancement by rhamnogalacturonan. The chemical specificity of interaction of rhamnogalacturonan with effector cells and virus-infected cells was found to be analogous to the interaction with tumor cells, i.e., both types of target cells must express a receptor for rhamnogalacturonan since rhamnogalacturonan-mediated enhancement of NK and LAK cytotoxicity against HCMV-infected cells was similarly inhibited by preincubation of CD56+ effector cells with 60% deacetylated D-mannose pentaacetate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Friedrich-Miescher-Laboratorium der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Steinmassl", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Anderer", "ForeName": "F A", "Initials": "FA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Viral Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "8801552", "ISSNLinking": "0882-8245"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BK9092J5MP", "NameOfSubstance": "viscum album peptide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytomegalovirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Killer Cells, Natural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8733917", "10.1089/vim.1996.9.27"]}}]}
