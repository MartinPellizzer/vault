FTIR, BET, FE-SEM, and TEM were applied to characterize the fabricated MET@MSNs and electrospun composite NFs. The presence of inorganic particles, nTiO<sub>2</sub> and MSNs, in the scaffolds improved their mechanical properties and led to a more sustained release of MET with almost the lack of the initial burst release from nTiO<sub>2</sub>/MET@MSNs-loaded NFs. The enhanced adhesion, metabolic activity, and proliferation rate of the hADSCs grown on nTiO<sub>2</sub>/MET@MSNs-loaded NFs were demonstrated via FE-SEM images, MTT test and PicoGreen assay, respectively, over 28\u00a0days of culture. Furthermore, the irregular nanofibrillar structures and the impact of sustained release of MET led to a significant upregulation in the mRNA levels of autophagy (Atg-5, Atg-7, Atg-12, and Beclin-1) and stemness (Nanog3, Sox-2, and Oct-4) markers as well as a considerable down-regulation of p16<sup>INK4A</sup> senescence marker. Further, the upregulation of hTERT, enhanced activity of telomerase, and increased telomere length were more pronounced in the hADSCs cultured on nTiO<sub>2</sub>/MET@MSNs-loaded NFs as compared to other types of NFs. Overall, our findings demonstrated the potential of the fabricated nanocomposite platform for counteracting cellular senescence and achieving sufficient quantities of fresh hADSCs with preserved stemness for various stem cell-based regenerative medicine purposes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
