Therefore, the current study aimed to synthesize AgNPs for the first time using aqueous root extracts of important plants of Pakistan i.e. Bergenia ciliata, Bergenia stracheyi, Rumex dantatus and Rumex hastatus and characterize them. In addition, antibacterial activity of synthesized AgNPs at 30-150\u2009\u03bcg/well was assessed using well diffusion method against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial strains that are considered most harmful bacteria for human beings. The characterization of synthesized AgNPs showed the absorption maxima ranged from 434 to 451\u2009nm and XRD confirmed the crystalline nature of AgNPs as well as FTIR elucidated the involvement of biomolecules for reduction and capping of AgNPs. SEM determined the average size of AgNPs ranging from 25 to 73\u2009nm and strong signals of silver were captured in EDX images. The result of antibacterial activity showed that only aqueous root extracts of all selected plants were inactive against all the tested bacterial strains. However, importantly, direct relationship between zone of inhibition of S. aureus, S. typhi and P. aeruginosa was found with increasing concentration of AgNPs of each selected plant. Moreover, S. haemolyticus was only inhibited by R. hastatus based AgNPs at only high concentrations and E. coli was inhibited by R. dantatus and R. hastatus based AgNPs. However, B. cereus was not inhibited by any AgNPs except R. hastatus and R. hastatus based AgNPs have greater antibacterial potential among all the synthesized AgNPs. These results suggest that synthesized AgNPs have improved antibacterial potential of root extracts of each selected plant and these synthesized AgNPs could be used in pharmaceutical and homeopathic industry for the cure of human diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
