However, their detailed mechanisms underlying the action against microorganisms remain largely unexplored. <i>Salmonella enterica</i> is a common pathogen causing both gastrointestinal and systemic diseases. In <i>Salmonella enterica</i>, the type III secretion system (T3SS) is employed to export secreted effectors directly to the cytoplasm of host cells. Using a SipA-\u03b2-lactamase reporter, we found that hyperoside (HYP) inhibited the activity of <i>Salmonella</i> T3SS needle protein InvG, prevented damage to host cells and protected mice against <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium. It was also observed that HYP binds to InvG directly through hydrogen-bridged cations and hydrophobic interactions. The unique mechanism of antibacterial action of HYP suggested that it could be used as a potentially effective candidate for future antimicrobial regimens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Center for Pathogen Biology and Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of the Ministry of Education, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China. lsong@jlu.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Zoonosis, Ministry of Education, Institute of Zoonosis, College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Zoonosis, Ministry of Education, Institute of Zoonosis, College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geriatrics, The Affiliated Hospital to Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130062, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anaesthesia, Jilin Province People's Hospital, Changchun 130062, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Longnv", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Center for Pathogen Biology and Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of the Ministry of Education, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China. lsong@jlu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Jie", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Center for Pathogen Biology and Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of the Ministry of Education, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China. lsong@jlu.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Zoonosis, Ministry of Education, Institute of Zoonosis, College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Xuming", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7083-5263"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiaoyun", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan 250012, Shandong, P.R.
