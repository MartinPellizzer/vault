The plant extract significantly suppressed the rise in peripheral blood glucose concentrations, both in the basal (fasting) state and after glucose intake. Suppression of basal blood glucose indicated a lowering effect of the plant extract on hepatic glucose output (HGO). The postprandial hypoglycemic effect of the plant extract without increasing insulin secretion was explained by; First: Potentiation of peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity. Second: by diminishing intestinal glucose absorption, which was evident by blunting plasma glucose levels throughout the oral glucose challenge. This plant might prove to have a promising therapeutic value in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, for besides its postprandial hypoglycemic effect, its suppression to hepatic glucose output in the fasting state is a beneficial therapeutic finding in favour of the plant as insulin is the most important drug that brings about this effect. The plant has also got a hypocholesterolemic effect more specifically on low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) which consequently raised the high density lipoprotein cholesterol/low density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C/LDL-C) ratio. This adds to its value as a protective and antiatherogenic agent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrinology Unit, National Research Centre, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Nicola", "ForeName": "W G", "Initials": "WG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ibrahim", "ForeName": "K M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mikhail", "ForeName": "T H", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Girgis", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khadr", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Boll Chim Farm", "NlmUniqueID": "0372534", "ISSNLinking": "0006-6648"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose Intolerance"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9035562"]}}]}
