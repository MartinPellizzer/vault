The leaves of these plants are folded and brushed (massage with teadust) against the teeth. Therefore, the present study is restricted only to the fleshy leaf extracts [Jindal et al. 1975] (except tea) of these plants inspite of certain limitations in the methodology and arbitrations in the microbial identification and isolation in the light of recent advances in folk dentistry. The investigation was carried out in two parts: 1) Experimental study: The efficacy of various dentifrices (commonly available in the market) and the potentiating effect of the leaf extract (LE) of the aforesaid indigenous plants when amalgamated with the tooth-paste against pathogens, were investigated. Further, the protection afforded by the said plant extracts (PE) over the conventional allopathic medicines on the human plaque cultures and gram negative bacteria from patients were studied. 2) Clinical study: The therapeutic effects of the said PE (individually) on clinical application among severely infected patients were examined."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Government Dental College and Hospitals, Asarva, Civil Hospital Compound, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "V K", "Initials": "VK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Venkatakrishna-Bhatt", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8003415", "ISSNLinking": "0174-4879"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Periodontal Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "44"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3042642"]}}]}
