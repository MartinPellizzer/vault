The various parts of Sapium species have been used in traditional Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of edema, skin-related diseases, bacterial infections, cancers, diabetes, and other ailments.", "A comprehensive and updated review on the phytochemistry, pharmacology, and traditional medicinal uses of Sapium has been summarized and discussed to facilitate further exploitation of the therapeutic values of Sapium species.", "The relevant information of Sapium species was collected by scientific search engines including Elsevier, Google Scholar, Scifinder, and CNKI (China national knowledge infrastructure), and Master's dissertations and Summon from Shandong University Library.", "Phytochemical studies revealed that approximately 259 compounds including terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, tannins, steroids, alkaloids, etc. have been isolated and identified from Sapium species, among which terpenoids, phenylpropanoids and tannins are the main constituents. Pharmacological in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that the extracts and pure compounds possessed significant antibacterial, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, antihypertensive effects, cytotoxicity, antidiabetic, molluscicidal effects. Terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, tannins, flavonoids, and alkaloids may be responsible for these activities.", "The traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacology described in this article demonstrated that the plants of Sapium genus possess many different types of compounds exhibiting wide range of biological activities, and they have high medicinal value and potential in the treatment of a variety of diseases. Detailed phytochemical studies have been conducted on only twelve species in the literature. More wide-ranging studies are still needed to explore this genus. Most of the existing bioactivity-related studies were implemented on crude extracts. More in-depth studies are necessary to reveal the links between the traditional uses and bioactivity in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
