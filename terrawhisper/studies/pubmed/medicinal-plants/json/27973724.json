Miq. Leaves.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["In the present study, an ayurvedic medicinal plant, Anthocephalus cadamba (Roxb.) Miq. commonly known as 'Kadamb' was explored for its potential against oxidative stress and cancer. The fractions namely AC-4 and ACALK (alkaloid rich fraction) were isolated from A.\u00a0cadamba leaves by employing two different isolation methods and evaluated for their in\u00a0vitro antioxidant and antiproliferative activity. The structure of the isolated AC-4 was characterized tentatively as dihydrocadambine by using various spectroscopic techniques such as ESI-QTOF-MS, <sup>1</sup> H- and <sup>13</sup> C-NMR, DEPT, COSY, HMQC, and HMBC. Results of various antioxidant assays viz. 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ABTS cation radical, superoxide anion radical scavenging, and plasmid nicking assay demonstrated that both the fractions viz. AC-4 and ACALK possess ability to scavenge DPPH, ABTS radicals and effectively protected plasmid pBR322 DNA from damage caused by hydroxyl radicals. Further, when both fractions were evaluated for their potential to suppress growth of HeLa and COLO 205 cells, only ACALK fraction showed antiproliferative effects. ACALK exhibited GI<sub>50</sub> of 205.98 and 99.54\u00a0\u03bcg/ml in HeLa and COLO 205 cell lines, respectively. Results of Hoechst staining in cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells confirmed that ACALK induced cell death in HeLa cells via apoptotic mode. Both the fractions also inhibited COX-2 enzyme activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Post Graduate Department of Botany, Khalsa College Amritsar, Punjab, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botanical and Environmental Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, 143005, India."}], "LastName": "Chandel", "ForeName": "Madhu", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botanical and Environmental Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, 143005, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Akal College of Basic Sciences (Botany), Eternal University, Baru Sahib, Sirmour, Himachal Pradesh, 173101, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Manish", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Product Chemistry and Process Development Division, CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology, Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, 176061, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Upendra", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Product Chemistry and Process Development Division, CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology, Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, 176061, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Bikram", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botanical and Environmental Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, 143005, India."}], "LastName": "Kaur", "ForeName": "Satwinderjeet", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biodivers", "NlmUniqueID": "101197449", "ISSNLinking": "1612-1872"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rubiaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27973724", "10.1002/cbdv.201600376"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
