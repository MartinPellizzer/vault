Moreover, the mechanism aspects of these secondary metabolites were discussed, which may help find more reliable drugs against SARSCoV- 2.", "Articles were searched on scientific websites including Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and IranMedex using the search terms herbal medicine and traditional medicine with coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19. Human, animal, and in vitro studies were identified in the search.", "Medicinal plants and their secondary metabolites may possess a potential role in combating this disease, and researchers suggest that some of these plants and their constituent compounds have inhibitory activity on coronaviruses. Numerous medicinal plants, their extracts, and secondary metabolites have been investigated over a period of time for antiviral activity. Among them, kaempferol, silybin, myricitrin, licoleafol, and curcumin are promising agents with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2. Natural compounds can form strong bonds with the active sites of SARS-CoV-2 protease. Structural and non-structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins such as Spike protein, PLpro, and 3CLpro are inhibited by these phytochemicals.", "Prospective treatments targeted at the life cycle stages of the virus may eventuate from research endeavors, and it must not be discounted that therapy originally derived from plant secondary metabolite sources may potentially have a part to play."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Breeding and Biotechnology, Sari Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University (SANRU), Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jamshidnia", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cardiff School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, CF10 3NB.
