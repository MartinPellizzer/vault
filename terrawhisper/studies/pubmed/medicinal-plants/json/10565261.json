On day 20 of gestation the dams were laparotomized under ether anesthesia, and the fetuses were removed and examined for toxicity of methylmercury. Garlic juice depressed the toxicity in terms of some parameters. In the case of simultaneous treatment with 0.1 g/kg garlic juice and MMC, rates of increase were 17.5% in maternal body weight, 13.2% and 41.9% in fetal and litters' weight respectively, and 37.0% in fetal survival rate. Decreasing rates were 10.0% in maternal death rate, and 6.9% and 31.3% in pre- and post-implantation loss respectively. Decreasing rates of mercury levels in dams were 67.2% in liver, 57.6% in brain, 47.2% in kidney, 42.1% in spleen and 40.9% in blood. As well, decreasing rates of mercury level in fetuses were 54.9% in all body burden, 55.9% in liver, 46.7% in kidney and 37% in brain, respectively. The number of fetal ossification centers were reduced by 23.8% to 58.0% following simultaneous treatment with 1.0 g/kg garlic juice. These findings indicated that garlic juice effectively inhibited the embryotoxicity of methylmercury in pregnant Fischer 344 rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Education, Kongju National University, Chungchungnam-do, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Roh", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Yonsei Med J", "NlmUniqueID": "0414003", "ISSNLinking": "0513-5796"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylmercury Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RWZ4L3O1X0", "NameOfSubstance": "methylmercuric chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Embryo Loss"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Embryo, Mammalian"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fetal Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Methylmercury Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Osteogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10565261", "10.3349/ymj.1999.40.5.483"]}}]}
