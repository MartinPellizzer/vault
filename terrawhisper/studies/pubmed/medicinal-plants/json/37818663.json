The efficient detoxification activity of glucosinolate sulfatases (GSSs) has successfully supported the feeding of <i>Plutella xylostella</i> on cruciferous plants. With the activity of GSSs hampered in <i>P. xylostella</i>, the toxic isothiocyanates produced from glucosinolates severely impair larval growth and adult reproduction. Therefore, inhibitors of GSSs have been suggested as an alternative approach to controlling <i>P. xylostella</i>. Herein, we synthesized eight adamantyl-possessing sulfamate derivatives as novel inhibitors of GSSs. <b>Adam-20-S</b> exhibited the most potent GSS inhibitory activity, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 9.04 mg/L. The suppression of GSSs by <b>Adam-20-S</b> impaired glucosinolate metabolism to produce more toxic isothiocyanates in <i>P. xylostella</i>. Consequently, the growth and development of <i>P. xylostella</i> were significantly hindered when feeding on the host plant. Our study may help facilitate the development of a comprehensive pest management strategy that combines insect detoxification enzyme inhibitors with plant chemical defenses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide, Key Laboratory of Natural Pesticide and Chemical Biology, Ministry of Education, College of Plant Protection, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510642, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Dehong", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Medical and Health Sciences, University of Sharjah, Sharjah 27272, United Arab Emirates."}], "LastName": "Zaraei", "ForeName": "Seyed-Omar", "Initials": "SO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Medical and Health Sciences, University of Sharjah, Sharjah 27272, United Arab Emirates."}], "LastName": "Sbenati", "ForeName": "Rawan M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Medical and Health Sciences, University of Sharjah, Sharjah 27272, United Arab Emirates."}], "LastName": "Ravi", "ForeName": "Anil", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide, Key Laboratory of Natural Pesticide and Chemical Biology, Ministry of Education, College of Plant Protection, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510642, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Yingjie", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide, Key Laboratory of Natural Pesticide and Chemical Biology, Ministry of Education, College of Plant Protection, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510642, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Lingda", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide, Key Laboratory of Natural Pesticide and Chemical Biology, Ministry of Education, College of Plant Protection, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510642, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jiali", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Medical and Health Sciences, University of Sharjah, Sharjah 27272, United Arab Emirates."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Sharjah, Sharjah 27272, United Arab Emirates."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mansoura University, Mansoura 35516, Egypt."}], "LastName": "El-Gamal", "ForeName": "Mohammed I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7841-2396"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide, Key Laboratory of Natural Pesticide and Chemical Biology, Ministry of Education, College of Plant Protection, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510642, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Hanhong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosinolates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9NFU33906Q", "NameOfSubstance": "sulfamic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.6.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfatases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isothiocyanates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PJY633525U", "NameOfSubstance": "Adamantane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosinolates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Insecta"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfatases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Isothiocyanates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adamantane"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "28"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37818663", "10.1021/acs.jafc.3c04879"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
