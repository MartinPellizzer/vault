The enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 85,000 Da according to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 79,000 Da according to gel-permeation chromatography under nondenaturing conditions. The purified xylosidase consisted of a series of closely related, enzymatically active proteins with isoelectric points ranging from about pH 7.35 to 7.7; the xylosidases were separated by chromatofocusing. The pH optimum of the mixed xylosidase was 4.9-5.1. The substrate specificity of the xylosidase mixture was determined by purification and structural characterization of the products of treating xyloglucan-oligosaccharide substrates with the enzyme. Characterization of the substrates and products included elution volume from a gel-permeation column, glycosyl residue and glycosyl linkage composition analyses, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The enzyme specifically cleaved only one of the alpha-xylosidic linkages of xyloglucan-oligosaccharide substrates, the one attached to a 6-linked glucosyl residue, not those attached to the 4,6-linked glucosyl residues. The enzyme was unable to cleave the xylosidic linkage of p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-xylopyranoside or the alpha-xylosidic linkage to C-6 of glucose in the disaccharide isoprimeverose. The enzyme was also unable to release measurable amounts of xylose from large xyloglucan polymers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, University of Georgia, Athens 30602."}], "LastName": "O'Neill", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Albersheim", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Darvill", "ForeName": "A G", "Initials": "AG"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "7 F32 GM10447", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37294-28-3", "NameOfSubstance": "xyloglucan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylosidases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xylans"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Xylosidases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2511203", "S0021-9258(19)47080-4"]}}]}
