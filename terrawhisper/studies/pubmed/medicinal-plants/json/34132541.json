Herein, \u03b2-carboline derivative <b>17c</b> was designed and synthesized with obvious myocardial protective activity for the first time. Pretreatment of <b>17c</b> effectively protected the cardiomyocyte H9c2 cells from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced lactate dehydrogenase leakage and restored the endogenous antioxidants, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). Besides, <b>17c</b> effectively protected the mitochondria through decreasing the reactive oxygen species overproduction and enhancing the mitochondrial membrane potential. As a result, <b>17c</b> significantly reduced the necrosis of cardiomyocytes in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress, which was more potent than polydatin. In MI/R injury rats, <b>17c</b> pretreatment obviously increased the levels of SOD and GSH-Px and inhibited the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Through this way, the size of myocardial infarction was significantly reduced after MI/R injury <i>in vivo</i>, better than that of polydatin, suggesting that <b>17c</b> is a promising cardioprotectant for the prevention of MI/R injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, P.
