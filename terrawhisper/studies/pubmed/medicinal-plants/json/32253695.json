In the current study, turnip (Brassica rapa) oil was evaluated for its fatty acid profiles, tocol composition, and total phenolic content. The radical scavenging properties of oil against DPPH\u00b7 and galvinoxyl radicals were also evaluated. Turnip oil efficiency in treating osteoporosis was tested in rats. Fifty adult female Sprague-Dawley albino rats were divided to five groups (n\u2009=\u200910/group). An osteoporotic rat model was prepared by two separate 5-day (5\u00a0days on/9\u00a0days off) courses of methotrexate subcutaneous injection. Osteoporotic rats were orally gavaged with turnip oil (200 and 400\u00a0mg/kg/day) for 28\u00a0days. Turnip oil efficiency in treating osteoporosis was studied by evaluation of Osterix, Cath K, and TNF-\u03b1 transcript expression levels that involved in bone remodeling in femoral bones. Minerals and vitamin D were estimated in blood serum. Femoral bone histological and morphometric analyses were investigated in osteoporotic and turnip oil-treated rats. In vitro assays revealed strong antiradical potential of turnip oil. Treatment with turnip oil regulated the levels of Osterix, Cath K, and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA that was accompanied with elevating the levels of calcium, phosphorous, bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), and vitamin D in osteoporotic rats. The histological and morphometric inspection revealed that turnip oil displayed progress in the osteoporotic rat bone formation that was clear in the enhancement of thickness of femur shaft cortical bone and femur head trabecular bone. Above-mentioned findings indicated that turnip oil has the potential to share in the treatment of osteoporosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8335-5381"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cell Biology Department, National Research Centre, 33 El Bohouth St., Dokki, Giza, P.O.12622, Egypt."}], "LastName": "El-Makawy", "ForeName": "Aida I", "Initials": "AI"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9593-4460"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research Department, National Research Centre, 33 El Bohouth St., Dokki, Giza, 12622, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ibrahim", "ForeName": "Faten M", "Initials": "FM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8535-9359"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cell Biology Department, National Research Centre, 33 El Bohouth St., Dokki, Giza, P.O.12622, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mabrouk", "ForeName": "Dalia M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9214-2388"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cell Biology Department, National Research Centre, 33 El Bohouth St., Dokki, Giza, P.O.12622, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abdel-Aziem", "ForeName": "Sekena H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pathology Department, National Research Centre, 33 El Bohouth St., Dokki, Giza, 12622, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Sharaf", "ForeName": "Hafiza A", "Initials": "HA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Agriculture, Zagazig University, Zagazig, 44519, Egypt. mhassanien@uqu.edu.sa."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Deanship of Scientific Research, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia. mhassanien@uqu.edu.sa."}], "LastName": "Ramadan", "ForeName": "Mohamed Fawzy", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sp7 protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.38", "NameOfSubstance": "Cathepsin K"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brassica napus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cathepsin K"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osteoporosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32253695", "10.1007/s11356-020-08540-7", "10.1007/s11356-020-08540-7"]}}]}
