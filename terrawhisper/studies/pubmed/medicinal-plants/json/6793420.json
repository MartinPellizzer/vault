Gossypol is a yellow substance which occurs in various parts of the cotton plant; its chemical structure is naphthol phenol. At the Capital Hospital gossypol was tested on 172 volunteers selected from hospital employees and workers from a nearby factory. All of the volunteers were under age 50, married and healthy with at least 1 child. Examinations required before treatment were general physical examination, a blood and urine analysis, an electrocardiogram, serum potassium concentration and serum analysis. 2 stages of gossypol treatment were required in the clinical study: the initial stage, the loading period, is of about 60 days. A daily dose of 20 mg gossypol was given successively for 60 days causing the sperms to become immotile, reduced in number or totally absent. A sperm count below 4 million/ml semen was considered to indicate infertility. The dosage in the 2nd stage, the maintenance period, was reduced to 1/3 of the original dose to maintain infertility. The volunteers were followed up every 2-3 months. Fatigue, decrease of libido and impaired appetite were the 3 main complaints. Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) activities showed that the transient symptoms of fatigue and loss of appetite were not related to disturbance of liver function. The mechanism of hypokalemia induced by gossypol is probably of renal origin. Infertility induced by gossypol in contraceptive doses over a relatively short period of administration was reversed about 3 months after stopping treatment. Gossypol used as a male antifertility agent has been found to be very effective and relatively safe."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["004341", "00089599"], "GeneralNote": ["Presented at the 10th World Congress on Fertility and Sterility, Madrid, 5-11 July, 1980", "TJ: REPRODUCCION."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Asia", "China", "Clinical Research", "Contraception", "Contraceptive Agents, Male--side effects", "Contraceptive Agents--side effects", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Eastern Asia", "Economic Factors", "Evaluation", "Family Planning", "Health", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Plants, Medicinal", "Reproductive Control Agents", "Research And Development", "Research Methodology", "Technology"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "6793420", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1981", "Month": "12", "Day": "21"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0303-5220", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "5", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1981", "Season": "Jul-Sep"}}, "Title": "Reproduccion", "ISOAbbreviation": "Reproduccion"}, "ArticleTitle": "Clinical study of gossypol as a male contraceptive.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "189", "EndPage": "193", "MedlinePgn": "189-93"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "G Z", "Initials": "GZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Reproduccion", "NlmUniqueID": "0427161", "ISSNLinking": "0303-5220"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents, Male"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KAV15B369O", "NameOfSubstance": "Gossypol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents, Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Gossypol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Haplorhini"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Testis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6793420"]}}]}
