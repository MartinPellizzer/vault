Rats were divied into four groups: sham-group, cerebral ischemia model-group, GETO-group(6. 1 g x kg(-1) x d(-1) )and Duxil-group (7.3 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)). Using immunohistochemistry technique we measured the expression quantity of CRF and PKC protein in hippocampus of MCAO rats at 2 h,6 h and 24 h after reperfusion, contrasted to Duxil.", "CRF: There were lots of positive and deeper dyeing neurons in hippocampus of model-group rats, while there were a few of positive and lighter dyeing neurons in sham-group, GETO-group and Duxil-group. The positive expression areas of CRF protein in hippocampus of model-group was significantly bigger than that of sham-group, GETO -group and Duxil-group respectively( P <0. 01). PKC: There were a great number of denser positive granules in hippocampus of model-group rats, while there were a few of scattered positive granules in sham-group, GETO-group and Duxil-group. The positive expression areas of CRF protein in hippocampus of model-group was significantly bigger than that of sham-group, GETO-group and Duxil-group respectively( P < 0. 01). At the same time there was not significant difference about the expression of CRF and PKC protein between GETO group and Duxil-group.", "The high expression of CRF and PKC induced by cerebral ischemia may be one important factor that resulted in the delayed neuronal death in hippocampus. GETO can down-regulate the expression of CRF and PKC induced by cerebral ischemia, which may be one of the mechanisms that the Chinese herbal extract complex, protect cerebral ischemic injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Geriatrics, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Jun-xiang", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Jin-zhou", "Initials": "JZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Long", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong-yan", "Initials": "YY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9015-71-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Kinase C"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hippocampus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Kinase C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17348196"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
