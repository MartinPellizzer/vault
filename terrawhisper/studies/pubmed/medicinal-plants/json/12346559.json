Since it marked the quincentennial of Columbus's first voyage to the Americas in 1992, the health and diseases of prehistoric people of Americas were exhibited. It is documented that 16th century Europeans and New World people had similar approaches in diagnosing and treating diseases, as well as preparing herbal medicines. Practical knowledge of medicinal plants was well developed in many New World cultures. Moreover, evidences confirming medical treatment in the pre-Columbian Americas are presented. At the time of European contact, the splinting of broken bones and the cleaning and treatment of wounds were well advanced in the native population. The study of historical documents, oral histories, and eyewitness accounts renders insight on the health status and medical practices of New World people at the time of early contact with Europe. However, archaeological researchers still continue to find artifacts to provide a deeper understanding of the long-term adaptations of human populations in the New World."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "KeywordList": [["Americas", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developed Countries", "Developing Countries", "Diseases", "Europe", "Health", "Health Services", "Indigenous Health Services", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Plants, Medicinal", "Research Methodology", "Retrospective Studies", "Studies", "Traditional Healers", "Treatment"]], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: PERSPECTIVES IN HEALTH"], "PMID": "12346559", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "2000", "Month": "02", "Day": "03"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "04"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [], "Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1020-5551", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "4", "Issue": "1", "PubDate": {"Year": "1999"}}, "Title": "Perspectives in health : the magazine of the Pan American Health Organization", "ISOAbbreviation": "Perspect Health"}, "ArticleTitle": "Health and medical practices in the pre-Columbian Americas.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "9", "EndPage": "12", "MedlinePgn": "9-12"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Verano", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Perspect Health", "NlmUniqueID": "9710450", "ISSNLinking": "1020-5551"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Americas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developed Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services, Indigenous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Therapeutics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12346559"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
