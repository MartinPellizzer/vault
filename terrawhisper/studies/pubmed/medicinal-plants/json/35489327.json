However, there is no effective way to reverse liver fibrosis.", "To investigate whether ginsenoside Rh2 (G-Rh2) can alleviate liver fibrosis and elucidate its underlying mechanism.", "In vivo and in vitro methods were adopted in this research. Choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD) was used to feed mice to induce liver fibrosis, and HSC-T6 cells were used to establish an LPS-induced model of liver fibrosis. Through histopathological staining, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, western blot analysis, intestinal bacteria 16SrRNA sequencing, and other technical means, the research explored whether G-Rh2 possesses anti-fibrotic activity.", "G-Rh2 could notably alleviate CDAHFD-induced liver fibrosis in mice. In particular, it could alleviate liver injury and reduce plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels. Additionally, G-Rh2 could repair intestinal injury as well as regulate intestinal microbial diversity and composition. HSC-T6 cells could be activated and autophagy could be induced further by LPS in vitro. After being treated with G-Rh2, autophagy was restrained and activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was controlled. Deeper research showed that G-Rh2 restrained the activation of HSCs via stimulating the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, restraining autophagy.", "The results of our studies clearly suggest that G-Rh2 repairs intestinal injury, improves intestinal microbial composition, reduces plasma LPS levels, and activates the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway to restrain LPS-mediated autophagy, thus playing an important role in anti-hepatic fibrosis. G-Rh2 was found to have the potential to effectively alleviate liver fibrosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier GmbH.
