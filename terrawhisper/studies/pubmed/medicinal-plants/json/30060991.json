Active plant extracts were screened for the presence of phytochemicals and tested against clinical isolates of Trichophyton tonsurans.", "Six different extracts (hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, ethanol, methanol and water) were obtained from each plant or algae sample using sequential solvent extraction. The antidermatophytic activity for the extracts was assessed using a colourimetric broth microdilution method. The viability of Vero cells was measured by Neutral Red uptake assay.", "All the extracts (except the water extracts of V.\u00a0amygdalina, C.\u00a0sertularioides and K.\u00a0alvarezii) showed antidermatophytic activity against Trichophyton spp. The minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) ranges for the plant extracts against T.\u00a0rubrum and T.\u00a0interdigitale are 0.0025-2.50 and 0.005-2.50mg/mL, respectively. The algae extracts exhibited lower potency against both species, showing MFC ranges of 0.08-2.50 and 0.31-2.50mg/mL, respectively. The ethanol and methanol extracts from the leaves of R.\u00a0excelsa, and the methanol and water extracts from the leaves of S.\u00a0myrtifolium were highly active (MFC<0.1mg/mL) and with high selectivity indices (SI>2.8) against reference strains of T.\u00a0rubrum and T.\u00a0interdigitale, and most of the clinical isolates of T.\u00a0tonsurans. Phytochemical analysis indicates the presence of alkaloids, anthraquinones, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, phenolics and triterpenoids in the extracts.", "The medicinal plant extracts exhibited stronger antidermatophytic activity compared to the algae extracts. The leaves of R.\u00a0excelsa and S.\u00a0myrtifolium are potential sources of new antidermatophytic agents against Trichophyton spp."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
