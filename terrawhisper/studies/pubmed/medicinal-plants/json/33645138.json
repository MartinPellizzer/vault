According to the findings, 75 species(including varieties) in 8 genera of Saxifragaceae plants, involving 21 varieties, are used in Tibetan medicine. Among them, 9 commonly used varieties, namely Songdi, Sedi, Yajima, Aoledansaierbao, Jiansidawu, Saiguo, Katuer, Sangdi, Maoqinghong, are recorded in Chinese Pharmacopoeia, Ministry Standards for Tibetan Medicine, Tibetan Medicine Standards and other local standards, accounting for 42.9% of the total number of varieties. Tibetan names, Tibetan translation of Chinese names, as well as original plant of Tibetan medicine varieties are quite different in relevant Tibetan medicine standards and literatures, which resulted in common phenomena of synonym and homonym. The standards of most varieties only involve characters, and microscopic, physical and chemical identification, with low quality standards. Based on the results of the analysis, this paper suggests strengthening surveys on herbal textual research, resources and current utilization of Saxifragaceae plants used in Tibetan medicine, summarizing the varieties, establishing improved quality standards, and perfor-ming a comparative study on therapeutic material basis and biological activity of different original plants, in order to promote rational use of these medicinal plant resources, and ensuring the accuracy, safety, and effectiveness of clinical medication."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Natural Resources of Chinese Medicinal Materials and Ethnic Medicine, Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330004, China."}], "LastName": "Xiang", "ForeName": "Jia-Mei", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Natural Resources of Chinese Medicinal Materials and Ethnic Medicine, Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330004, China."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Guo-Yue", "Initials": "GY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Natural Resources of Chinese Medicinal Materials and Ethnic Medicine, Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330004, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Natural Resources of Chinese Medicinal Materials and Ethnic Medicine, Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330004, China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asian People"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Tibetan Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saxifragaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33645138", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200902.601"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
