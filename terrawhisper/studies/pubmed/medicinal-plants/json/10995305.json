Of the cereals and cereal byproducts analyzed, only rye (5147 U kg(-)(1); 21 955 U g(-)(1)), wheat (1637 U kg(-)(1); 10 252 U g(-)(1)), rye bran (7339 U kg(-)(1); 56 722 U g(-)(1)), and wheat bran (4624 U kg(-)(1); 14 106 U g(-)(1)) were rich in Phy and AcPh activities. Legume seeds and oilseeds contained negligible Phy activity and a moderate amount of AcPh activity, except for kidney bean (33 433 U g(-)(1)) and full-fat linseed meal (13 263 U g(-)(1)). On the other hand, a significant linear regression between phytate phosphorus (y) and total phosphorus (x) was observed in cereal byproducts (R(2) = 0. 95; y = 0.8458x - 0.0367; P < 0.001) and oil seeds (R(2) = 0.95; y = 0.945x - 0.20; P < 0.001). Phy and AcPh were positively correlated with respect to phytate phosphorus in cereals, cereal byproducts, and other byproducts and negatively correlated in legume seeds and oilseeds. Except for cereals, the highest correlation between enzyme activities and phytate phosphorus was found for phytase. It is not possible to predict Phy and AcPh activities from phytate phosphorus content by linear and quadratic regressions. Finally, only highly significant and positive correlation was found between Phy and AcPh activities for cereals, cereal byproducts, and oilseeds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Producci\u00f3n Animal, Facultad de Veterinaria, Ciudad Universitaria, 28040 Madrid, Spain. viverosa@eucmos.sim.ucm.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Viveros", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Centeno", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brenes", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Canales", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lozano", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Acid Phosphatase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.26", "NameOfSubstance": "6-Phytase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "6-Phytase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acid Phosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10995305", "10.1021/jf991126m", "jf991126m"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
