The nanoparticles produced from the medicinal plant extracts are identified as an exceptional applicant in nanomedicine, cosmetics, and agriculture for the treatment of diseases as antimicrobial, antioxidant and anticancer agents, etc. Plant extracts actually have bioactive metabolites that provide therapeutic potential against a variety of diseases. Herein, we review the production of bioactive compounds from leaves, roots, seeds, flowers and stems. We further summarize the different methods for obtaining plant extracts and the green technologies for the synthesis of nanoparticles of plant derived bioactive compounds. Biotechnological aspects of these synthesized nanoparticles are also added here as highlights of this review. Overall, plant derived nanoparticles provide an alternative to conventional approaches for drug delivery as well and present exciting opportunities for future research on novel areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Protein Research Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Integral University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, 226026, India."}], "LastName": "Bano", "ForeName": "Naushin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Protein Research Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Integral University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, 226026, India."}], "LastName": "Izhar", "ForeName": "Syed Khalida", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Anamika", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh."}], "LastName": "Zaheer", "ForeName": "Mohd Rehan", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4296-6105"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Protein Research Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Integral University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, 226026, India."}], "LastName": "Roohi"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Recent Pat Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101309942", "ISSNLinking": "1872-2083"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38644720", "10.2174/0118722083301253240417114400", "BIOT-EPUB-139880"]}}]}
