Here, we proposed a new approach to separate and identify the allelochemical group precisely and effectively, in which the \"knock-out/in\" methods of targeting ingredients in the model of medicinal effect identification and quality control were applied. This method will contribute to deep understanding plant allelopathy, and provide theoretical basis and technical support for alleviating consecutive monoculture problems simultaneously."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials GAP, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials GAP, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Bao", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials GAP, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicinal, Ji'nan 250000, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hong-Yan", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials GAP, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ming-Jie", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials GAP, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "He'nan Agriculture University, Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "He'nan Agriculture University, Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Feng-Qing", "Initials": "FQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials GAP, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Crop Ecology and Molecular Physiology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fujian Province University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhong-Yi", "Initials": "ZY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pheromones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allelopathy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Knock-In Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pheromones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28959857", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170103.021"]}}]}
