Nelumbinis Plumula is a Chinese traditional herb which showed antitumor activity. To find if the Nelumbinis Plumula affect protein disulfide isomerase activity, we studied its chemical constituents, and 12 monomeric compounds were isolated by means of solvent extraction, silica gel column chromatography, preparative HPLC and recrystallization. Among them, N-methylcoclaurine, kaempferol, chrysoeriol-7-O-neohesperidoside and mannitol were obtained for the first time. Following, we tested the compounds inhibitory activity on protein disulfide isomerase. The results showed that N-methylcoclaurine, neferine, liensinine and isoliensinine could inhibit the activity of protein disulfide isomerase in vitro, their IC\u2085\u2080 values were 1.4, 2.9, 4.0 and 5.4 \u03bcmol\u2022L\u207b\u00b9, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Science, Jinlin University, Changchun 130021, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Science, Jinlin University, Changchun 130021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cangzhou Medical College, Cangzhou 061000, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xi-Zhen", "Initials": "XZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Science, Jinlin University, Changchun 130021, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qing-He", "Initials": "QH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Science, Jinlin University, Changchun 130021, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.3.4.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Disulfide-Isomerases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lotus"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Disulfide-Isomerases"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29139271", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170512.002"]}}]}
