It is grown in many countries including China that had more than 9300 hm2 of commercial cultivation area in 2021. In March 2020, a leaf spot disease sporadic occurred in field rosemarry plants in Nanyang City (32\u00ba51\u00b4 N, 111\u00ba36\u00b4 E), Henan Province, China. The disease outbreaked in September with a disease incidence of 57-83%. Symptoms initially appeared as small brown leaf spots that gradually expanded into dark blackbrown irregular lesions. Most of the spots started from the leaf tip or leaf margin, and gradually spread to the leaf base, resulting in heavy defoliation especially on rainy days. Diseased leaf segments (1\u00d73 mm) were surface-sterilized by dipping in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 1 min, rinsed three times with sterile distilled water, and plated on potato dextrose agar, then incubated at 28\u00b0C in the dark for 5 days. Twelve fungal isolates with the same morphological characteristics were obtained from nine affected leaves. The fungal colonies were initially white and turned gray brown with flocculent aerial mycelia and a whorled back. Conidia were frequently born in a long chain, with a short beak, brown or light-brown, 13.2 to 48. 7 (average 26.1) \u00d7 4.0 to 13.1 (average 8.0) \u03bcm in size (n=148) with 0 to 8 transverse and 0 to 3 longitudinal/oblique septa. Phenotypic features of the isolates agreed with those of Alternaria alternata (Simmons et al. 2007). Two isolates Aa1 and Aa2 were randomly selected for molecular and pathogenicity tests. DNA was extracted from mycelia. Partial sequences of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1-\u03b1) were amplified using the primer pairs ITS1/ITS4 and EFI-728F/EFI-986R (Wei et al. 2022), respectively. The GenBank accession nos. were OK036714 and OK036715 for ITS, and ON951980 and ON951981 for TEF1-\u03b1 of Aa1 and Aa2, respectively, with a maximal identity of greater than 99% to multiple A. alternata strains. In the neighbour joining phylogenetic tree of the amplified ITS and TEF1-\u03b1 sequences both Aa1 and Aa2 clustered with A. alternata strains, clearly separating them from other Alternaria spp. For pathogenicity test, conidial suspensions (1\u00d7106 spores /mL) of Aa1 and Aa2 were separately sprayed on healthy one-year-old rosemary plants (n=3) with their leaves slightly wounded with a sterilized needle. Control plants (n=3) were sprayed with sterile water. Both inoculated and control plants were incubated at 90% RH, 28 \u00b0C. After 14 days, all the inoculated leaves showed black brown lesions similar to those on naturally affected field plants, whereas controls remained symptomless. Fungal cultures with the same phenotypic features as the inocula were constantly re-isolated from the infected leaves. A. alternata was reported as pathogen causing foliar necrosis on rosemary in Italy (Perello et al.1995) and leaf spot (or leaf blight) on multiple plant species such as Actaea dahurica (Hai et al. 2022), and Ligustrum japonicum (Wei et al. 2022) in China. This is the first report of A. alternata causing leaf black spot on rosemary in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanyang Normal University, School of Agricultural Engineering, No.1638, Wolong Rd, Nanyang, Henan, China, 473061; silianghuang@aliyun.com."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Siliang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanyang, China; 985300864@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Siqing", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Protection Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 174 East University Road, Xixiangtang District, Nanning,Guangxi, Nanning, Guangxi, China, 530001; 1464596962@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Di", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Protection Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanning Daxue East Road NO.174, Nanning, Guangxi, China, 530007; 78960987@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Chan Juan", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanyang Normal University, 71072, School of Agricultural Engineering, , nanyang, China, 473000; 1203017121@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Xue Ling", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanyang Normal University, 71072, Nanyang, Henan, China; lyying200508@163.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yuying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanyang Normal University, School of Agricultural Engineering, Nanyang, Henan, China; 896923465@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Ai Li", "Initials": "AL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, No.189, Changgang road, Nanning City,Guangxi, P.R.China, Nanning, Guangxi, China, 530023; yeyunfeng111@126.com."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Yunfeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Daxue RoadNanning, Guangxi, China, 530007; fug110@gxaas.net."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36281016", "10.1094/PDIS-09-22-2165-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
