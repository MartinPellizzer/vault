AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine kinase and a key player in energy metabolism regulation. AMPK is also considered as a prime target for pharmaceutical and therapeutic studies on disorders such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity, where the body energy homeostasis is imbalanced. Following the activation of AMPK (physiological or pharmacological), a cascade of metabolic events that improve metabolic health is triggered. While there are several publications on this subject, this is the first report that has focused solely on polyphenols targeting diabetes via AMPK pathway. The multiple characteristics of polyphenolic compounds and their favorable influence on diabetes pathogenesis, as well as their intersections with the AMPK signaling pathway, indicate that these compounds have a beneficial effect on the regulation of glucose homeostasis. PPs could potentially occupy a significant position in the future anti-diabetic drug market."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal
