As a result, alternative maintenance therapies are tested in the hope for optimum therapy. Since opium tincture is a new and innovative maintenance treatment in Iran, we attempted to compare the therapeutic and side effects of opium tincture with two standard therapies, i.e., methadone and buprenorphine. Hence, thyroid function was tested in three methods of maintenance therapies with methadone, buprenorphine, and opium tincture in a cross-sectional study. In this study, 150 patients with the mean age of 51.63\u2009\u00b1\u200913.56\u2009years and a history of opioid or opioid-derivatives use disorder, underwent the maintenance treatment with methadone, buprenorphine, and opium tincture at Bojnurd Addiction Treatment Centers in northeastern Iran. These patients were selected using convenience sampling. Then, they were placed into three treatment groups of methadone, buprenorphine, and opium tincture. The thyroid functionality was assessed with measuring TSH, fT4, fT3, T3RU, and Anti TPO, carried out in a reference laboratory. Finally, these data were analyzed by ANOVA using SPSS.16 software. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the average levels of TSH, fT3, fT4, and Anti TPO in these treatment groups; except for T3RU concentration, which was increased significantly in the opium tincture group as compared to the methadone treated group. Also, the frequency of fT4, and T3RU disorders demonstrated a significant change in three groups. The findings of the present study demonstrated that opium tincture in comparison with methadone could increase T3RU levels resulting in euthyroidism possibly through TBG."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of endocrinology, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shakeri", "ForeName": "Habibesadat", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hejrati", "ForeName": "Reihaneh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Addiction and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hojjat", "ForeName": "Seyed Kaveh", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community Medicine, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khalili", "ForeName": "Mina Norozi", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Gynecology, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Farazmand", "ForeName": "Tooba", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Addict Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9107051", "ISSNLinking": "1055-0887"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thyroid Hormones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "40D3SCR4GZ", "NameOfSubstance": "Buprenorphine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8008-60-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Opium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "UC6VBE7V1Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Methadone"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Addict Dis. 2021 Jan-Mar;39(1):144. doi: 10.1080/10550887.2020.1812840", "PMID": "32856565"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Buprenorphine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Methadone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Opioid-Related Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Opium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Thyroid Hormones"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32749208", "10.1080/10550887.2020.1791377"]}}]}
