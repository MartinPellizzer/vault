This study focused on isolating, purifying, and characterizing lectin from Combretum glutinosum seeds (CGSLs) to assess its potential as an analgesic and antiulcer agent. CGSL extraction involved defatting and buffer extraction, followed by purification using ammonium sulfate fractionation and fetuin-agarose affinity column chromatography. The isolectins (iso-CGSLs), each consisting of 60\u00a0kDa and 57\u00a0kDa heterodimeric subunits, displayed glycoprotein properties with a 40\u00a0% neutral sugar content. They exhibited peak activity at 55\u00a0\u00b0C and remained stable for up to the fifth day at room temperature. The activity exhibited a pH dependence, peaking between 7.5 and 10.5, and all seemingly operated independently of metal ions. CGSL, at optimal doses ranging from 6 to 12\u00a0mg/kg, had significant analgesic effects on acetic acid-induced writhing and hot plate tests in mice. Evaluation using 0.7\u00a0% acetic acid resulted in notable pain reduction across all doses (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The analgesic effect of lectin was partially reversed by naloxone (a morphine antagonist), indicating partial involvement of the opioid receptor system. Furthermore, CGSL exhibited antiulcer effects in ethanol-induced gastric ulcer models in rats, highlighting its therapeutic potential as a natural alternative for analgesic and antiulcer treatments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
