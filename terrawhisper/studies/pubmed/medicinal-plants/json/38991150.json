The antineoplastic properties of \u03b2-ST are established in various solid malignancies; however, its effect on DLBCL is uncharted. This study investigates the role of \u03b2-ST in DLBCL as well as the underlying mechanisms. Our findings indicated that \u03b2-ST impeded DLBCL cell proliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. \u03b2-ST appeared to alter sphingolipid metabolism, facilitate acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) translocation to the plasma membrane, augment ceramide platforms through increased ceramide synthesis, and consequently induce apoptosis in DLBCL cells. Furthermore, we found that RTX initiated both apoptotic and survival pathways <i>in vitro</i>, with the former contingent on the transient activation of the ASM, and \u03b2-ST could amplify the anti-DLBCL efficacy of RTX by modulating ASM/Ceramide (Cer) signaling. Collectively, our findings elucidate the mechanistic role of \u03b2-ST in DLBCL and underscore its potential in amplifying the antineoplastic efficacy of RTX via ASM activation, proposing a potential avenue to improve the efficacy of RTX therapy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, Tianjin Union Medical Center of
