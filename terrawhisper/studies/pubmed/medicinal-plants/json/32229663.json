The litholytic effect was determined on the basis of the in vitro effect of the aqueous extracts on the formation of crystals of stones. Finally, chemical compounds were investigated to identify their target using an in silico approach. Methods The antioxidant activity was determined with the diphenylpicrylhydrazyl radical trapping method. An aliquot of 2 mL of urine and 100 \u03bcL of an infusion of fruit and leaf aqueous extract of Z. lotus at different concentrations were used. The induction of calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals was done by the addition of oxalic acid at 0.1 mol/L. The effect of aqueous extracts was compared with two inhibitors (citrate and magnesium) used as references. In silico modelization was carried out using SwissTargetPrediction. Results The antioxidant activity test showed that the methanol extract was active with an IC50 of 5 mg/mL. The aqueous extracts of fruits and leaves inhibit the formation of crystals of CaOx. Then, the composition of the methanol extracts of the leaves and fruits in high-performance liquid chromatography showed majority compounds such as quercetin-3-galactoside and hyperin. In silico assays showed that the identified molecules exert their effect by targeting enzymes responsible for calcium regulation, urate regulation, and maintenance of acid-base balance, and that had anti-inflammatory properties. Conclusions The present study showed that Z. lotus may be considered as a functional or nutraceutical food. However, further studies should be carried out in order to extract and purify these compounds to test their effect on urinary lithiasis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Human Pathologies Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Mohammed V University Rabat, 67, Bd My Abdelhafid, Rabat, El Jadida, Morocco, Phone: 00212674158222."}], "LastName": "Aya", "ForeName": "Khouchlaa", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Human Pathologies Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Mohammed V University Rabat, Rabat, Morocco."}], "LastName": "M'hamed", "ForeName": "Tijane", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9101750", "ISSNLinking": "0792-6855"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Citrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2612HC57YE", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Oxalate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8O1CR18L82", "NameOfSubstance": "hyperoside"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I38ZP9992A", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Oxalate"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Citrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Urine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ziziphus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32229663", "10.1515/jbcpp-2019-0091", "/j/jbcpp.ahead-of-print/jbcpp-2019-0091/jbcpp-2019-0091.xml"]}}]}
