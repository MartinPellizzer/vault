Because of this significant diversity and historical background in identification and utilization to remedy human and animal diseases, export of medicinal plant can help to strengthen local as well as natural economy. Buglosse (Fig. 1) is one of the most important and common medicinal plants in Iran and exist as Echium amoneum and Borago officinalis. This work was conducted in order to identify the causal agent(s) of damping off disease in buglosse. Plant disease samples were taken from Esfahan and Tehran provinces. Symptoms on original plant including root, crown rot, dark tissue, pith and hallow root were collected in order to isolate disease agent(s). Symptomatic root and crown tissues after surface sterilization with 96% ethanol were transferred on to PDA and WA media and also on moist filter paper in petri dishes. Two fungal colonies grew from tissue segments and spore culture was subsequently purified. The fungal isolate identified as Rhizoctonia solani based on the following test. Hyphal tip was removed from colony margin placed on PDA and PSA media and incubated in dark. Colony diameter of one hundred hyphae measured and nucleus was stained according to Bandoni (1979), Kronland and Stanghellini (1988). It was observed that in each cell of hyphae there are more than two nuclei. Single spore culture were obtained from macroconidia of Fusarium isolate. After 24 hr of incubation, growing single spore were transferred to KCL medium to detect spore chains. Fungal isolates transferred to PSA and PDA media for sporulation. After 7 days colonies appeared as white cream to pinkish on top and cream to dark pink at the bottom of petri dish with abundant micro and macro conidia. Colonies were snow white, felting shape, with ample causal hyphae on PSA medium. On KCL medium, fungal growth was superficial and colonies were colorless with long macroconidia and individual sausage-shape macroconidia being thinner one side and having maximum four septa. Microconidia were long double compartment round on both side, straight to slightly curved. Base on morphology and dimension of conidia and production of chlamidospore the funguses identify as Fusarium solani."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agriculture, University of Tehran, Karaj, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okhovvat", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zakeri", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moshashai", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Belgium", "MedlineTA": "Commun Agric Appl Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101200320", "ISSNLinking": "1379-1176"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Borago"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Echium"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Fusarium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizoctonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16637194"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
