The aim of this study was to identify the plant species most commonly involved in cases of plant poisoning in Hong Kong and to provide clinicians with a reference tool for the diagnosis and management of plant poisoning.", "We retrospectively reviewed all plant poisoning cases referred to the Hospital Authority Toxicology Reference Laboratory from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2017. Demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, treatment and outcomes of patients, as well as morphological identification and analytical testing of the plant specimens, were investigated.", "A total of 62 cases involving 26 poisonous plant species were identified, among which <i>Alocasia macrorrhizos</i> (Giant Alocasia), <i>Gelsemium elegans</i> (Graceful Jessamine), and <i>Rhododendron</i> (Azalea) species were the three most commonly encountered. Gastrointestinal toxicity (n=30, 48%), neurological toxicity (n=22, 35%), and hepatotoxicity (n=6, 10%) were the three most common clinical problems. Forty-nine (79%) and eight (13%) patients had mild and moderate toxicity, respectively; they all recovered shortly with supportive treatment. The remaining five (8%) patients experienced severe toxicity requiring intensive care support. Most patients (n=61, 98%) used the plants intentionally: as a medicinal herb (n=31), as food (n=29), and for attempting suicide (n=1). Reasons for using the poisonous plants included misidentification (n=34, 55%), unawareness of the toxicity (n=20, 32%), and contamination (n=6, 10%).", "Although most plant exposure resulted in a self-limiting disease, severe poisonings were encountered. Epidemiology of plant poisonings is geographically specific. Clinicians should be aware of local poisonous plants and their toxicities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hospital Authority Toxicology Reference Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Princess Margaret Hospital, Laichikok, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Ng", "ForeName": "W Y", "Initials": "WY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hospital Authority Toxicology Reference Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Princess Margaret Hospital, Laichikok, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Hung", "ForeName": "L Y", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hospital Authority Toxicology Reference Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Princess Margaret Hospital, Laichikok, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Lam", "ForeName": "Y H", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hospital Authority Toxicology Reference Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Princess Margaret Hospital, Laichikok, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hong Kong Herbarium, Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Pang", "ForeName": "K S", "Initials": "KS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hospital Authority Toxicology Reference Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Princess Margaret Hospital, Laichikok, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Chong", "ForeName": "Y K", "Initials": "YK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hospital Authority Toxicology Reference Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Princess Margaret Hospital, Laichikok, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Ching", "ForeName": "C K", "Initials": "CK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hospital Authority Toxicology Reference Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Princess Margaret Hospital, Laichikok, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Mak", "ForeName": "T W L", "Initials": "TWL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Hong Kong Med J", "NlmUniqueID": "9512509", "ISSNLinking": "1024-2708"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hong Kong"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}], "CoiStatement": "All authors have disclosed no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30967518", "10.12809/hkmj187745"]}}]}
