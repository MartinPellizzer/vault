The possibility that the same molecules responsible for cellular adhesion in the host may also play a major role in determining host-bacterial interactions is now becoming more evident. The following review looks at the interaction of a group of host binding proteins, including lectins, fibronectin, and laminin, with respect to their specific association with bacteria. This information is dealt with both from the perspective of the ecology of the host and its autochthonous and pathogenic bacterial populations, as well as in terms of the difficulties in defining the nature of ligand associations even in the more simplified bacterial-host interaction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary, Alta., Canada."}], "LastName": "Ceri", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Westra", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Cell Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8606068", "ISSNLinking": "0829-8211"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carrier Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carrier Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecology"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "83"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3048329", "10.1139/o88-064"]}}]}
