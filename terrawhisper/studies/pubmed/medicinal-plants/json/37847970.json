This study examined two types of melatonin application, pre-sowing (prMel) and application during growth (ptMel), in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings exposed to four different doses (100, 200, 300, and 400\u00a0Gy) of radioactive cobalt (<sup>60</sup>Co) gamma rays as dry seeds to investigate their ameliorative effects on ionizing radiation (IR) stress. Peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, mono- and dihydroxyperoxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activities, and levels of lipid peroxidation, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and total glutathione (GSH), and phenolic acids (PHAs) in soluble free, ester, glycoside and ester-bound forms were examined in the seedlings. Both melatonin applications were found to increase lipid peroxidation, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and GSH contents previously reduced by gamma irradiation. The IR treatment-induced increases in enzyme activities were significantly reduced by melatonin applications. The study findings indicated that high doses of IR resulted in significant decreases in the activity and levels of the measured traits. The predominant PHAs in the tissues were vanillic, ferulic, and p-coumaric acids. In addition, ptMel application combined with IR stress lowered the total phenolic acid contents in the soluble forms while increasing those in the cell wall-bound form. In conclusion, the antioxidant system in the seedlings exposed to the different gamma ray doses was regulated by prMel and ptMel applications in such a manner as to alleviate IR stress-induced oxidatives damages in the wheat."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
