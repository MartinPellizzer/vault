During in vitro tests, BPE treatment increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in a dose-dependent manner in primary head kidney leukocytes. Similarly, ROS production rates were enhanced by LJE (50 and 100\u00a0mg/ml) and COE (100\u00a0mg/ml). This suggests that these three herbal extracts possess immunostimulating properties. We then conducted two feeding trials to examine the effects of these three herbal extracts on growth and innate immune parameters of cobia, and sought an optimal dietary supplementation proportion required for activating the non-specific immune responses. In the first trial, we supplemented the diet with 1, 5, or 10% of the individual extracts. After a ten-week feeding trial, no negative impacts on weight gain, feed conversion rate, and survival rate were observed in fish offered experimental diets. Further, ROS production, phagocytic capacity of the head kidney leukocytes, and serum lysozyme activity were enhanced by differing degrees in fish fed the herbal extracts compared to fish in the control group. A similar albumin/globulin ratio was seen between each experimental group and the control group regardless of the type and dose of herbal extract used, indicating these medicinal herbal extracts are safe for cobia. We then performed a 30-day feeding trial with lower extract concentrations (1, 3, and 5% of the diet) to identify dose responses in cobia at various time points so that we could establish a cost-effective manner of administering the three extracts for cobia. All BPE fed fish had higher ROS production compared to the control group, while phagocytosis rate and index were simultaneously raised in only the BPE30 group (3% BPE). Immune parameters such as ROS production, phagocytic rate, and serum lysozyme activity were triggered when fish received 30\u00a0g LJE per kg of feed. However, ROS production only increased in the LJE10 group (1% LJE) on day 30 and was not enhanced in the LJE50 group (5% LJE). Additionally, although the phagocytic rate and phagocytic index were induced in the LJE50 group, serum lysozyme activity was not elevated in this group (LJE50) at any time point examined. ROS production was greatly improved in all COE fed groups, but only the COE30 group (3% COE) showed prolonged enhanced phagocytic rate over the 30-day feeding trial."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
