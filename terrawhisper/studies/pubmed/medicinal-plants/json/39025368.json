Using four variables-pH, cell density, amount of RA, and temperature-the biotransformation parameters were optimized using RSM and BBD. Under optimized conditions (pH 6, 10\u202f% of microbial cells, 10\u202fg/L RA at 28\u00b0C), the conversion was maximum and resulted to 80\u202f% (+)-GDL (4.4\u202fg/L/120\u202fh) yield in shake flask (500\u202fmL). Furthermore, optimization was achieved by adjusting the aeration and agitation parameters in a 3\u202fL bioreactor, which were then replicated in a 10\u202fL bioreactor to accurately determine the amount of (+)-GDL. In bioreactor condition, 4.7\u202fg/L (>85\u202f%) of (+)-GDL is produced with 20\u202f% and 40\u202f% dissolved oxygen (1.0 vvm) at 150\u202frpm in 72\u202fh and 66\u202fh, respectively. Further, a new Al-Mg-Ca-Si composite column-chromatography method is developed to purify enantiospecific (+)-GDL (99.9\u202f%). This (+)-GDL is 100\u202f% nature-identical as validated through <sup>14</sup>C-radio-carbon dating. Thorough chemical investigation of enantiospecific (+)-GDL is authenticated for its use as flavour. This bioflavour has been developed through a cost-effective biotechnological process in response to the demand from the food industry on commercial scale."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
