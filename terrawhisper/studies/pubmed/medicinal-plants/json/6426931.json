EOG, EMG of cervical muscles, ECG and EEG (two-sided: centro-occipital and fronto-central - have been recorded from 6 male and 5 (3) female healthy volunteers. Amplified signals have been analysed on-line (power spectral analysis) and the sleep profiles have been calculated accordingly. After one night for adaptation, each subject took orally placebo, 60 and 120 mg valerian (1 resp. 2 capsules Harmonicum Much) according to a randomized double-blind repeated measures-design. The sleep investigations have been carried out by distance of a week for each condition (dosage per subject). In the morning following this night, the subjects completed a mood scale. Both dosages showed a decrease of sleep stage 4 and a slight reduction of REM-sleep. Contrary, a slight increase of sleep stage awake, 1 and 2 could be observed. A further increase of sleep stage 3 could be identified. After application of 120 mg valerian , the frequency of REM-phases (in %) declined during the first half of the night, whereas during the second part of the night, a surplus appeared. Changes or the Beta-intensity of the EEG during REM-sleep show a stronger hypnotic effect for the 120 mg dosage than for 60 mg. Maximum effect was observed between 2 and 3 hours post medicationem . Results of the mood scale are indifferent between the experimental conditions, which indicate no negative (side-) effects neither by drug nor by testing methods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gessner", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Klasser", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"], "VernacularTitle": "Untersuchung der Wirkung von Harmonicum Much auf den Schlaf mit Hilfe polygraphischer EEG-Aufzeichnungen."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "EEG EMG Z Elektroenzephalogr Elektromyogr Verwandte Geb", "NlmUniqueID": "0264413", "ISSNLinking": "0012-7590"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electroencephalography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep Stages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Valerian"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6426931"]}}]}
