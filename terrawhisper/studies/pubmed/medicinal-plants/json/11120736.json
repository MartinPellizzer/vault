Influence of pH and carboxyl group distribution along the pectic chains.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "8841", "EndPage": "8847", "MedlinePgn": "8841-7"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Well-characterized pectin samples with a wide range of degrees of esterification (39-74%) were incubated with the solubilized pure alpha and gamma isoforms of pectinmethylesterase, from mung bean hypocotyl (Vigna radiata). Enzyme activity was determined at regular intervals along the deesterification pathway at pH 5.6 and pH 7.6. It has been demonstrated that the distribution of the carboxyl units along the pectin backbone controls the activity of the cell wall pectinmethylesterases to a much greater extent than the methylation degree, with a random distribution leading to the strongest activity. Polygalacturonic acid was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of the alpha isoform activity at pH 5.6 and to inhibit the gamma isoform activity at both pH 5.6 and pH 7.6. Under these conditions, the drop in enzyme activity was shown to be correlated to the formation of deesterified blocks of 19 +/- 1 galacturonic acid residues through simulations of the enzymatic digestion according to the mechanisms established previously (Catoire, L., Pierron, M., Morvan, C., Herve du Penhoat, C., and Goldberg, R. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 33150-33156). However, even in the absence of inhibition by the reaction product, activity dropped to negligible levels long before the substrate had been totally deesterified. Comparison of alpha and gamma isoform cDNAs suggests that the N-terminal region of catalytic domains might explain their subtle differences in activity revealed in this study. The role of pectinmethylesterase in the cell wall stiffening process along the growth gradient is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 7632, Universit\u00e9 P. et M.
