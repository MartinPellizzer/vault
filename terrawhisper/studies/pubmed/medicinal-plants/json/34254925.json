Under the current COVID-19 pandemic conditions, natural therapeutics with the least side effects are the need of the hour to save the patients, especially, which are pre-affected with other medical complications. Although plants are the major sources of terpenoids; however, for the environmental concerns, the global interest has shifted to the biocatalytic production of molecules from microbial sources. The gram-positive bacterium <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> is a suitable host in this regard due to its GRAS (generally regarded as safe) status, ease in genetic manipulations and wide industrial acceptability. The <i>B. subtilis</i> synthesizes its terpenoid molecules from 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) pathway, a common route in almost all microbial strains. Here, we summarize the computational and synthetic biology approaches to improve the production of terpenoid-based therapeutics from <i>B. subtilis</i> by utilizing DXP pathway. We focus on the <i>in-silico</i> approaches for screening the functionally improved enzyme-variants of the two crucial enzymes namely, the DXP synthase (DXS) and Farnesyl Pyrophosphate Synthase (FPPS). The approaches for engineering the active sites are subsequently explained. It will be helpful to construct the functionally improved enzymes for the high-yield production of terpenoid-based anticancer and antiviral metabolites, which would help to reduce the cost and improve the availability of such therapeutics for the humankind."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food, Drug and Chemical Toxicology Group, CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Vishvigyan Bhawan, 31 Mahatma Gandhi Marg, Lucknow-226001, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad- 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Shukla", "ForeName": "Vibha", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation, Vaddeswaram, Guntur- 522502, Andhra Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Runthala", "ForeName": "Ashish", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biotechnology, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi-110067, India."}], "LastName": "Rajput", "ForeName": "Vikrant Singh", "Initials": "VS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, National Institute of Technology Warangal, Warangal-506004, Telangana, India."}], "LastName": "Chandrasai", "ForeName": "Potla Durthi", "Initials": "PD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food, Drug and Chemical Toxicology Group, CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Vishvigyan Bhawan, 31 Mahatma Gandhi Marg, Lucknow-226001, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad- 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Tripathi", "ForeName": "Anurag", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation, Vaddeswaram, Guntur- 522502, Andhra Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Phulara", "ForeName": "Suresh Chandra", "Initials": "SC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101240303", "ISSNLinking": "1573-4064"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pandemics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Synthetic Biology"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "17"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34254925", "10.2174/1573406417666210712211557", "MC-EPUB-116659"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
