These isoprenoids exhibit a broad range of biological activities, such as antitumor and antiplasmodial activities. Here, we report the collective total synthesis of perovskone, perovskones C, D, F, hydrangenone, and hydrangenone B. The key strategies in this work include the following: (1) an asymmetric photoenolization/Diels-Alder reaction was developed to construct a tricyclic ring bearing three contiguous quaternary centers, which was used to build the core icetexane skeleton; (2) a bioinspired Diels-Alder reaction of perovskatone D with <i>trans</i>-\u03b1-ocimene was applied to stereospecifically generate perovskones; (3) late-stage oxidations and ring forming steps were developed to synthesize perovskones and hydrangenones. Our synthetic work suggests that (1) perovskatone D may serve as the precursor of the biosynthesis of perovskones and (2) the formation of hydrangenone and hydrangenone B, containing a five-membered D ring, may involve an oxidative ring cleavage and ring regeneration process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry and Chemical Processes, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering East China Normal University, 3663N Zhongshan Road, Shanghai 200062, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Baochao", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry and Chemical Processes, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering East China Normal University, 3663N Zhongshan Road, Shanghai 200062, China."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Guoen", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry and Chemical Processes, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering East China Normal University, 3663N Zhongshan Road, Shanghai 200062, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Quan", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry and Chemical Processes, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering East China Normal University, 3663N Zhongshan Road, Shanghai 200062, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, East China Normal University, 3663 North Zhongshan Road, Shanghai 200062, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Haibing", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6919-4577"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry and Chemical Processes, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering East China Normal University, 3663N Zhongshan Road, Shanghai 200062, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, East China Normal University, 3663 North Zhongshan Road, Shanghai 200062, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Shuanhu", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Norisoprenoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "hydrangenone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cycloaddition Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Norisoprenoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33886312", "10.1021/jacs.1c02674"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
