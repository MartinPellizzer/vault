Cannabinoid receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems have been shown to modulate pain perception. We conducted a clinical trial to assess the impact of smoked cannabis on neuropathic pain in HIV. This was a phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of analgesia with smoked cannabis in HIV-associated distal sensory predominant polyneuropathy (DSPN). Eligible subjects had neuropathic pain refractory to at least two previous analgesic classes; they continued on their prestudy analgesic regimens throughout the trial. Regulatory considerations dictated that subjects smoke under direct observation in a hospital setting. Treatments were placebo and active cannabis ranging in potency between 1 and 8% Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, four times daily for 5 consecutive days during each of 2 treatment weeks, separated by a 2-week washout. The primary outcome was change in pain intensity as measured by the Descriptor Differential Scale (DDS) from a pretreatment baseline to the end of each treatment week. Secondary measures included assessments of mood and daily functioning. Of 127 volunteers screened, 34 eligible subjects enrolled and 28 completed both cannabis and placebo treatments. Among the completers, pain relief was greater with cannabis than placebo (median difference in DDS pain intensity change, 3.3 points, effect size=0.60; p=0.016). The proportions of subjects achieving at least 30% pain relief with cannabis versus placebo were 0.46 (95%CI 0.28, 0.65) and 0.18 (0.03, 0.32). Mood and daily functioning improved to a similar extent during both treatment periods. Although most side effects were mild and self-limited, two subjects experienced treatment-limiting toxicities. Smoked cannabis was generally well tolerated and effective when added to concomitant analgesic therapy in patients with medically refractory pain due to HIV DSPN."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, CA 92103, USA. roellis@ucsd.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ellis", "ForeName": "Ronald J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Toperoff", "ForeName": "Will", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vaida", "ForeName": "Florin", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van den Brande", "ForeName": "Geoffrey", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonzales", "ForeName": "James", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gouaux", "ForeName": "Ben", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bentley", "ForeName": "Heather", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Atkinson", "ForeName": "J Hampton", "Initials": "JH"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P30 MH062512", "Acronym": "MH", "Agency": "NIMH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P30 MH062512-10", "Acronym": "MH", "Agency": "NIMH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial, Phase II", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Neuropsychopharmacology", "NlmUniqueID": "8904907", "ISSNLinking": "0893-133X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Placebos"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7J8897W37S", "NameOfSubstance": "Dronabinol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Activities of Daily Living"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Affect"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Dronabinol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "HIV Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Marijuana Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pain, Intractable"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Placebos"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Polyneuropathies"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>DISCLOSURE</b>.
