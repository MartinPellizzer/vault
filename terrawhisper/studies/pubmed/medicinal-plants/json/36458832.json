Herein, a series of novel BA and OA derivatives were synthesized by conjugation with per-<i>O</i>-methylated-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (PM-\u03b2-CD), and their anticancer properties against a panel of three human cancer cell lines were evaluated. Two OA-PM-\u03b2-CD conjugates (<b>48</b> and <b>50</b>) were observed to be the most potent conjugates against the three cell lines (MCF-7, BGC-823, and HL-60), with a 15- to 20-fold decrease in the IC<sub>50</sub> values (IC<sub>50</sub>: 6.06-8.47 \u03bcM) compared with their parental conjugate (OA). Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining and Western blot analysis revealed that both conjugates induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Additionally, in the representative conjugate <b>48</b>-treated HL-60 cells, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequent release of cytochrome <i>c</i> into the cytosol were observed, indicating the activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Furthermore, <b>48</b> dramatically induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HL-60 cells, and the corresponding effect could be reversed using the ROS scavenger <i>N</i>-acetylcysteine. Collectively, these results suggest that the novel pentacyclic triterpenoid derivatives trigger the intrinsic apoptotic pathways <i>via</i> the ROS-mediated activation of caspase-3 signaling, inducing cell death in human cancer cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, School of
