At least four AI isoforms were identified in pigeonpea seeds. The AIs inhibit human salivary and bovine pancreatic amylase but fail to inhibit bacterial, fungal and endogenous amylase. Pigeonpea AIs were found to be active over a pH range of 4.5 to 9.5 and were heat labile. The isoelectric point of a major inhibitor is 6.2 AIs were tolerant to proteolysis by trypsin, chymotrypsin, bromelain and endogenous pigeonpea proteases. Pigeonpea AIs were synthesized during late seed development and also degraded during late germination. Addition of AIs or protease inhibitors (PIs) alone to a diet of Helicoverpa armigera larvae did not increase mortality. However, the larvae reared on a diet containing AIs and PIs in combination, showed increased mortality and adverse effects on larval growth and development. In vitro inhibition of Helicoverpa gut amylase revealed that only 22% activity is sensitive to inhibitors. Further investigations on interactions of pigeonpea AIs and PIs with Helicoverpa gut enzymes is necessary to develop strategies to strengthen defense mechanisms in pigeonpea against H. armigera."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, Aurangabad, India."}], "LastName": "Giri", "ForeName": "A P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kachole", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Amylases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Endopeptidases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Amylases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endopeptidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Pancreas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Salivary Glands"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9431672", "10.1016/s0031-9422(97)00570-0", "S0031942297005700"]}}]}
