Taxa so identified can subsequently be weighted appropriately in semi-quantitative selection systems.", "Plant data sourced from the SANBI MedList database, the most comprehensive inventory of ethnomedicinal plants for the Flora of southern Africa region were grouped by order. A least squares regression analysis was applied to test the null hypothesis that the use of these plants by traditional healers is strictly random. Of 'hot' orders subsequently identified, characteristics of taxa therein were assessed to better determine the roles played by (i) growth forms, and (ii) inherent chemical diversity, in plant selections by ethnomedicinal practitioners.", "Analyses identified seven principally 'hot' plant orders (Malpigiales, Fabales, Gentianales, Asteraceae, Solanales, Malvales and Sapindales) and 'hot' families therein from a total of 55 regional ethnomedicinal orders. Five 'cold' ethnomedicinal orders (Rosales, Proteales, Poales, Asparagales and Caryophyllales) were shown to be significantly less represented in the medicinal flora than predicted. No clear growth form preferences were identified across orders. The presence of highly diverse bioactives was evident in the 'hottest' plant families from 'hot' plant orders.", "These 12 outliers identified by the regression analyses allowed for the falsification of the null hypothesis. Indications are that 'hot' taxa are selected traditionally on the basis of bioactivity, which is reflected in chemical diversity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological and Conservation Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Private Bag X01, Scottsville 3209, South Africa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Douwes", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Crouch", "ForeName": "N R", "Initials": "NR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Edwards", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mulholland", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa, Southern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Least-Squares Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18761073", "10.1016/j.jep.2008.07.040", "S0378-8741(08)00403-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
