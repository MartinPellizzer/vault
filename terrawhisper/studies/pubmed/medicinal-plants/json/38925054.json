The pore structure and adsorption performance can be further regulated by modulating the doping ratios of medium-tetra(4-carboxylphenyl) porphyrin and 4,4'-dicarboxydiphenyl sulfones. The MTV-MOFs of PCN-224-DCDPS<sub>1.0</sub> possesses very large specific surface area (1625\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>/g). Using PCN-224-DCDPS<sub>1.0</sub> as sorbent, a dispersive solid-phase extraction method was developed to extract and preconcentrate SAs from water, eggs, and milk prior to high performance liquid chromatography analysis. The limits of detection of method were determined between 0.17 and 0.27\u00a0ng/mL with enrichment factors ranging 214-327. The adsorption can be finished within 30\u00a0s, and the recovery rate remains above 80\u00a0% after 10 repeated uses. The adsorption capacities of sorbent were determined from 300 to 621\u00a0mg/g for sulfadiazine, sulphapyridine, sulfamethoxydiazine, sulfachlorpyridazine, sulfabenzamide, and sulfadimethoxine. The adsorption mechanisms were investigated and can be attributed to \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interactions. This work represents a method for preparation of MTV-MOFs and uses as sorbent for extraction and enrichment of trace pollutants from complex samples."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
