Krylov. Among them, euphomicrophane C and F were possessed the endo-type core structure that naturally rarely appeared. The structures of the purified undescribed compounds were established by extensive spectroscopic and spectrometric analysis, and the single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis was used to determine the absolute configuration of euphomicrophane E, elusone A and euphorbesulin G. All the isolates were screened for their reversal abilities on P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistant cancer cell line MCF-7/ADR.
