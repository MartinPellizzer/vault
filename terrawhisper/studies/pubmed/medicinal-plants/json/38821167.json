Experimental studies included reports of mechanistic data providing affinity, efficacy, and half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>). Among the 108 included studies, 174 structures, and 16 targets were extracted. The most frequent ligands belonged to the miscellaneous category with 40.2% followed by phytocannabinoid-similar, indole-similar, and pyrrole-similar structures with an abundance of 17.8%, 16.6%, and 12% respectively. 64.8% of structures acted as agonists, 17.1 % appeared as inverse agonists, 10.8% as antagonists, and 7.2% of structures were reported with antagonist/inverse agonist properties. Our outcomes identify the affinity, EC<sub>50</sub>, and efficacy of the interactions between cannabinoids and their corresponding receptors and the subsequent response, evaluated in the available evidence. Considering structures' significance and very important effects of on the activities, the obtained results also provide clues to drug repurposing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
