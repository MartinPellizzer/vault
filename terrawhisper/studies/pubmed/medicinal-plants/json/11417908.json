Binding of anti-GPIIb/IIIa and anti-GPIb monoclonal antibodies to platelets was not significantly different between hyperlipidemia patients and controls. However, expression of CD62P on platelets and levels of PMPs were higher for hyperlipidemia patients than in controls, although the difference between groups in CD62P expression was not significant (PMPs: 534 +/- 63 vs. 388 +/- 47, p < 0.05; CD62P: 9.1% +/- 1.45 vs. 7.3% +/- 1.15, N.S.). Although there were no differences in expression of CD36 and CD40 by monocytes between the two groups, levels of MMPs were higher in hyperlipidemia patients than in controls (MMPs: 147 +/- 21 vs. 59 +/- 8, respectively, p < 0.01). Levels of anti-oxidized LDL antibody and sE-selectin were also higher in hyperlipidemia patients. We studied the effects of Saiko-ka-ryukotsu-borei-to on levels of these factors in patients with elevated triglyceride levels. After Saiko-ka-ryukotsu-borei-to treatment, levels of CD62P, PMPs, sE-selectin, and anti-oxidized LDL antibody were reduced significantly. Levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol and MMPs also decreased, but the changes were not significant. These findings suggest that Saiko-ka-ryukotsu-borei-to prevents the development of vascular complications in hyperlipidemia patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Moriguchi Osaka, Japan. fwkg4681@mb.infoweb.ne.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nomura", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hattori", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sakakibara", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fukuhara", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Phytomedicine", "NlmUniqueID": "9438794", "ISSNLinking": "0944-7113"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Autoantibodies"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "E-Selectin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "P-Selectin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "saiko-ka-ryukotsu-borei-to"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Autoantibodies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "E-Selectin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperlipidemias"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Kampo"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Monocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "P-Selectin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11417908", "10.1078/0944-7113-00035", "S0944-7113(04)70024-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
