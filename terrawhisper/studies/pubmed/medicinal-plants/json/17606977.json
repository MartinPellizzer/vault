However, whether these polysaccharides from different sources and structures can elicit similar immunological effects remain unknown. This study aims to investigate and compare the effects of selected groups of purified and crude polysaccharides on human dendritic cells (DCs), the most potent antigen-presenting cells. The selected polysaccharides were from Ganoderma lucidum [(GL) Lingzhi, Reishi], a medicinal mushroom commonly used by oriental; and barley glucan, a purified polysaccharide with known in vivo immunomodulating effect. We found that purified polysaccharides from GL mycelium could induce human PBMC proliferation and phenotypic and functional maturation of DCs with significant IL-12 and IL-10 production. Polysaccharides of GL spore and barley were both rather weak immunostimulator in vitro. In general, all these polysaccharides did not polarize T cells into either T(h)1 or T(h)2 or regulatory T cells, except for crude spore polysaccharides-treated DCs which could suppress T cell proliferation with IL-10 production. This study revealed the polysaccharides of different sources have different immune potency and effect on human immune cells including DCs. Our study also provides a reproducible biological platform for comparing the potential therapeutic effects of different herbal-derived polysaccharides in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Hong Kong Jockey Club Clinical Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, 102 Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Wing Keung", "Initials": "WK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Law", "ForeName": "Helen Ka Wai", "Initials": "HK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Zhi-Bin", "Initials": "ZB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lau", "ForeName": "Yu Lung", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Godfrey Chi-Fung", "Initials": "GC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "8916182", "ISSNLinking": "0953-8178"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CD4 Antigens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lymphotoxin-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "130068-27-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-10"}, {"RegistryNumber": "187348-17-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-12"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "CD4 Antigens"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Dendritic Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endocytosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hordeum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-10"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-12"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes, Mononuclear"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphotoxin-alpha"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Reishi"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17606977", "10.1093/intimm/dxm061", "dxm061"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
