The known toxin families to exist in snake venom, such as Phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>, Snake venom Metalloprotease, were evaluated to understand the mechanism of venom neutralizing ability of the herbal preparation.", "The LD<sub>50</sub> of D.\u00a0russelii venom, as measured using the 5-day old chicken embryo model, was 4.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.865 ug (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a084.8%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.079). The pre-incubation of venom with the herbal preparation increased the LD<sub>50</sub> of D.\u00a0russelii venom to 17.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.35\u00a0\u03bcg (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a081.0%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.100), showing a clear neutralizing action of D.\u00a0russelii venom toxicity by the herbal medicine. Whereas the pre-incubation of venom with the 1\u00d7 venom neutralizing dose of commercially available polyvalent anti-venom serum shifted the LD<sub>50</sub> venom only up to 5.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.35\u00a0\u03bcg (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a098.8%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.069). In the presence of the herbal preparation, Phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> activity of D.\u00a0russelii venom was significantly reduced from 9.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-3</sup>\u00a0mM\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup> to 8.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-3</sup>\u00a0mM\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup> and that of N.\u00a0naja from 2.92\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0mM\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup> to 0.188\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0mM\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>. Further, the pre-incubation of N.\u00a0naja venom with the herbal preparation significantly reduced its Metalloprotease activity from 0.069 units min<sup>-1</sup> to 0.019 units min<sup>-1</sup>.", "The herbal preparation shows a clear neutralizing action against the toxicities of D.\u00a0russelii and N. naja venoms demonstrating the potential to be used as a plant based antidote for snake envenomation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Transdisciplinary University, Bangalore and World Ayurveda Foundation.
