Although herbal medicines, with their favorable safety profiles and low adverse effects, have been suggested to be useful for the treatment of cognitive impairment, the potential role of the NVGU as the target of the effects of herbal medicines is still unclear.", "This review aimed to retrieve evidence from experimental studies of phytopharmaceuticals targeting the NVGU for the treatment of cognitive impairment in AD and VD, and discussed the potential of phytopharmaceuticals to improve cognitive impairment from the perspective of the NVGU.", "We systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and CNKI. The keywords used for searching information on the NVGU in the treatment of cognitive impairments included \"Alzheimer's disease,\" \"Vascular dementia,\" \"Herbal medicines,\" \"Natural products,\" \"Neurovascular,\" \"Adverse reaction,\" and \"Toxicity, etc.\" We selected studies on the basis of predefined eligibility criteria.", "NVGU mainly consists of endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and neurons, and damage to these cells can induce cognitive impairment by impairing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) as well as neuronal function. The active components of herbal medicines, including Ginkgo biloba L., Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Epimedium Folium, Chuanxiong Rhizoma, Carthami flos, and Acorus tatarinowii Schott, as well as traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions have shown the potential to improve BBB function and increase CBF to prevent cognitive impairment by inhibiting astrocyte and microglia activation, protecting oligodendrocyte myelin function, reducing neuronal apoptosis, and promoting angiogenesis.", "Herbal medicines demonstrate great potential to prevent cognitive impairment. Multiple components from herbal medicines may function through different signaling pathways to target the NVGU. Future studies using novel drug-carrier or delivery systems targeting the NVGU will certainly facilitate the development of phytopharmaceuticals for AD and VD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier GmbH.
