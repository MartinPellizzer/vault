These 60 extracts were screened for their cytotoxicity on the aforementioned cell lines using MTT assay.", "All plant species showed certain anticancer activity against at least one of the 4 cancer cell lines and obvious selective cytotoxicities were observed. Compared with Huh-7 and HeLa cells, MCF-7 and BALL-1 cells were more sensitive to the treatments of the phytochemical extracts. The PEE, CE and EAE of Brassica campestris, the PE and CE of Hibiscus syriacus, as well as the BE of Pittosporum tobira exhibited strong anticancer activity but weak cytotoxicity on the normal cell line.", "Our results provided new evidence for anticancer activities of these plants which could be useful for developing new anticancer therapies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, P.R.
