The animal model of ASO was established with a combined method of mechanical trauma, immunologic injury and high fat fodder feeding. Rabbits were administrated the drugs 8 weeks after surgery. The levels of TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C in serum were determined at the time points below: pre-experiment (0 week), pre-drug administration (8 weeks post-surgery), 4 weeks after drug administration (12 weeks post-surgery), 8 weeks after drug administration (16 weeks post-surgery), 12 weeks after drug administration (20 weeks post-surgery). Meanwhile, the behavioral study was performed, the distal skin temperature of the injured hind limb detected. The histopathological changes in iliofemoral artery were examined after opacification.", "The levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, VLDL-C and TC/HDL-C were decreased significantly in serum of ASO rabbits. The severity of lameness in the injured hind limb was improved. The distal skin temperature was increased. The thickness and the ratio of intima area of the iliofemoral artery of the injured hind limb were decreased, while the stenosis extent was improved.", "TXL might be beneficial to modulate blood lipid, as well as the prevention and treatment for ASO."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100091, China. chengren1230@sina.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Cheng-Ren", "Initials": "CR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xue-Ying", "Initials": "XY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhuang", "ForeName": "Bai-Xi", "Initials": "BX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jian-Xun", "Initials": "JX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsules"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "tongxinluo"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Arteriosclerosis Obliterans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Arthropods"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Capsules"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Femoral Artery"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Iliac Artery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Tunica Intima"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17552158"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
