Although popular as an unconventional therapy modality, no controlled randomized clinical trials are available, reliably documenting a clinically beneficial antineoplastic potential of the various commercial mistletoe preparations. Since previous investigations have focused on the purified galactoside-specific lectin (Viscum album L. agglutinin, VAA) as major biological response modifier in the low-dose range, the objective of the present experimental study was to examine its effect on N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN)-induced carcinogenesis in the urinary bladder of rats, a suitable animal model for human disease. The carcinogen was fed by gavage in three fractionated low doses (150 mg/kg body weight each) to obtain low-grade and low-stage transitional cell carcinomas. From the onset of the experiment VAA was injected subcutaneously twice a week (1 ng/kg body weight) continuously for either 6 or 15 months. Following an experimental period of 6 months the incidence of bladder carcinomas was 10.2% in rats given exclusively BBN and 6.7% in those additionally treated with VAA. After an experimental time of 15 months 25.8% of the rats fed BBN only and 19.7% of the animals additionally receiving VAA had developed urothelial carcinomas. The differences of the tumor incidences did not reach the level of statistical significance, neither after an experimental duration of 6 (P = 0.88) nor of 15 months (P = 0.71). A difference was found in the size of the transitional cell carcinomas. They proved to be significantly larger (P = 0.02) in the rats additionally treated with VAA for 15 months (mean maximum diameter: 3.31 mm) than in those without lectin treatment (mean maximum diameter: 1.88 mm). Quantitative immunocytochemistry analyzing a panel of immune cells yielded no evidence for the ability of the lectin to provoke a substantial, biologically relevant local cellular immune response in the wall of tumor-free and tumor-bearing bladders. From the current experiment it is obvious that galactoside-specific mistletoe lectin failed to protect against, inhibit, delay or reduce development of chemically induced urothelial carcinomas of the urinary bladder even after long-term administration in the clinically recommended schedule. It seems highly unlikely that adjuvant treatment with mistletoe extracts or VAA might favorably influence bladder cancer in patients by immunological effector mechanisms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Georg-August-University, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kunze", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schulz", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adamek", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gabius", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Cancer Res Clin Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "7902060", "ISSNLinking": "0171-5216"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Galactosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toxins, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ribosome inactivating protein, Viscum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3817-11-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Butylhydroxybutylnitrosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Butylhydroxybutylnitrosamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "immunology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Transitional Cell"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Administration Schedule"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Galactosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Immunity, Cellular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Toxins, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Failure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "immunology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10741906", "10.1007/s004320050022"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
