Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats under pentobarbital anesthesia were randomly assigned to one of four groups receiving i.v. injection of physiological saline (control), i.v. injection of 70 mg/kg paraquat, or i.v. injection of either 50 mg/kg of margarite extract or 50,000 unit/kg of r-h SOD 10 minutes before and 1 and 2 hours after an equivalent paraquat administration. Examination of lung superoxide anion radicals (O2-.), lipid peroxides, and histopathological changes showed that paraquat significantly increased superoxide anion radicals (383% of control) reacted with CLA-phenyl. Both margarite extract and r-h SOD decreased superoxide anion radicals to 119% and 83% of control, respectively. Margarite extract, rather than r-h SOD, significantly alleviated the paraquat-induced infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages into the alveolar walls. There were no significant inter-group differences in lipid peroxides in the lung. Component analysis showed that margarite extract was rich in L- and D-arginine. The scavenging mechanism of margarite extract may be related to L-arginine but needs to be further verified in the future study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First Department of Anesthesiology, School of Medicine, Dokkyo University, Mibu, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ogata", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "X X", "Initials": "XX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Circ Shock", "NlmUniqueID": "0414112", "ISSNLinking": "0092-6213"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PLG39H7695", "NameOfSubstance": "Paraquat"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Anions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Paraquat"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7895320"]}}]}
