The ejaculatory latency measured by stopwatch and sexual satisfaction ratio of both partner and patient were investigated twice in the screening period and once after each treatment (1 placebo 0.20 g and 5 SS-cream 0.20 g for a total of six treatments). Patients were instructed to apply the cream on the glans penis 1 hour before sexual intercourse in a double-blind randomized fashion. Clinical efficacy was compared with the prolongation of ejaculatory latency and improvement of the sexual satisfaction ratio before and after each treatment.", "In the screening period, the mean ejaculatory latency was assessed at 1.37 +/- 0.12 minutes, and neither the patients nor their partners were satisfied with their sexual lives. After treatment, the mean ejaculatory latency was prolonged to 2.45 +/- 0.29 minutes in the placebo group and 10.92 +/- 0.95 minutes in the SS-cream group. The clinical efficacy of placebo and SS-cream as judged by an ejaculatory latency time prolonged more than 2 minutes was 15.09% and 79.81%, respectively. The improvement of sexual satisfaction to a grade higher than effective was 19.81% and 82.19%, respectively, for placebo and SS-cream. Of 530 trials of SS-cream, 98 (18.49%) resulted in a sense of mild local burning and mild pain. No adverse effect on sexual function or partner and no systemic side effects were observed.", "According to these results, SS-cream is effective and safe in the treatment of premature ejaculation, with mild local side effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology and Institute of Andrology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "G W", "Initials": "GW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moon", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xin", "ForeName": "Z C", "Initials": "ZC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Y D", "Initials": "YD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "W H", "Initials": "WH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rha", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Y J", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "D K", "Initials": "DK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Clinical Trial, Phase III", "Journal Article", "Multicenter Study", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Urology", "NlmUniqueID": "0366151", "ISSNLinking": "0090-4295"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Placebos"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Topical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chi-Square Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ejaculation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Placebos"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10688090", "10.1016/s0090-4295(99)00415-x", "S0090-4295(99)00415-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
