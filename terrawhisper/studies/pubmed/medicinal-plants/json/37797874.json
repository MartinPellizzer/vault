The LPS-stimulated cells treated with the ethanol extracts of Erythrina lysistemon Hutch., Pterocelastrus rostratus Walp. Syzygium cordatum Hochst. ex Krauss and Warburgia salutaris (G. Bertol.) Chiov., demonstrated significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005) inhibition up to 85% of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 secretion compared to the LPS control. Additionally, P. rostratus and S. cordatum aqueous bark extracts substantially decreased the secretion of all the tested cytokines and chemokines. Chemical investigation of the S. cordatum extract resulted in the identification of four ellagic acid derivatives: ellagic acid 4-O-\u03b1-rhamnopyranoside (1), ellagic acid 4-O-\u03b1-4\u2033-acetylrhamnopyranoside (2), 3-O-methylellagic acid 4'-O-\u03b1-3\u2033-O-acetylrhamnopyranoside (3) and 3-O-methylellagic acid 4'-O-\u03b1-4\u2033-O-acetylrhamnopyranoside (4), along with mixtures of ellagic acid 4-O-\u03b1-2\u2033-acetylrhamnopyranoside (5), ellagic acid 4-O-\u03b1-3\u2033-acetylrhamnopyranoside (6) and ellagic acid (7). Their structures were confirmed by mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, and comparison with data from literature.", "The cytokine inhibition properties of most of the medicinal plants screened herein are reported for the first time.
