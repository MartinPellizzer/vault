Studies also examined whether S-allylmercaptocysteine and S-allylcysteine affect two important molecular targets, namely reduced glutathione and polyamines. Results showed that S-allylmercaptocysteine (50 mg/L) diminished LNCaP cell growth whereas the antiproliferative effect of S-allylcysteine was not as pronounced. Studies using synthetic S-cysteinyl analogues revealed that growth inhibition was most effective with compounds containing a disulfide or an active diallyl moiety. Marginal to no inhibitory effect was observed with monosulfinic analogues. Both S-allylmercaptocysteine and S-allylcysteine caused an increase in LNCaP cell reduced glutathione concentrations. Putrescine and spermine concentrations decreased and spermidine increased 3 d after S-allylmercaptocysteine treatment. At 5 d after S-allylmercaptocysteine treatment, polyamine concentrations were similar to those of saline-treated controls. Diminished cell growth and altered polyamine concentrations suggest that S-allylmercaptocysteine may impede the polyamine synthesizing enzyme, ornithine decarboxylase, either by enhancing the formation of reduced glutathione, a known inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, or by reacting directly with ornithine decarboxylase at its nucleophilic thiol moiety. Because S-allylcysteine also increases reduced glutathione formation but does not significantly inhibit growth, the latter mechanism may be more likely for this compound. These data provide further evidence that nonessential nutrients derived from garlic may modulate tumor growth. Further research is required on effects of garlic derivatives in vivo before information from the present studies can be used to assist in the development of effective nutritional strategies for preventing progression of prostate cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. pintoj@mskcc.org"}], "LastName": "Pinto", "ForeName": "J T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Qiao", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rivlin", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Protomastro", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Weissler", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thaler", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Heston", "ForeName": "W D", "Initials": "WD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA 29502", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "CA 39203", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "DK/CA 47650", "Acronym": "DK", "Agency": "NIDDK NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Clin Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0376027", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9165"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K848JZ4886", "NameOfSubstance": "Cysteine"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Am J Clin Nutr. 1997 Aug;66(2):425-6. doi: 10.1093/ajcn/66.2.425", "PMID": "9250126"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cysteine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polyamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Prostatic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9250120", "10.1093/ajcn/66.2.398"]}}]}
