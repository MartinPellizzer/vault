Most furanocoumarins tested at 0.1 mM reduced microsomal testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation as an index of CYP3A activity to less than 50% of the control. In particular, the dimer and trimer derivatives of furanocoumarins showed striking inhibition, whose potencies were similar to that of a typical CYP3A inhibitor, ketoconazole. Preincubation of dimer types of furanocoumarins increased suppression but not most of the monomer derivatives, suggesting that the inhibition on CYP3A activity was caused by at least plural mechanisms. These results raised the possibility that the furanocoumarin containing herbal medicines may alter pharmacokinetics of co-ingested drugs similar to the case with grapefruit juice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Drug Metabolism and Molecular Toxicology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "L Q", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taniguchi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Y Q", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baba", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohta", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamazoe", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Jpn J Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "2983305R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-5198"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10877530", "10.1254/jjp.82.122"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
