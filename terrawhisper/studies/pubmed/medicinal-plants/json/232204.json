The absence of menses in a woman must be treated as a disease because menses is believed to be the removal of bad blood. The most widely used plants are cotton root bark (Gossypium sp.), inmortal (Asclepias capricornu Woodson), wormseed (Chenopodium ambrosioides L.), poleo chino (Hedeoma oblongifolia), rue (Ruta graveolens L.), and 3 species of Aremesia. The cotton root bark, when used as an abortifacient, exhibits the lowest toxicity. Rue is used independently within different cultures but may exhibit toxic side effects when used as an abortifacient. The plants are used by 3 principal practitioners: 1) curanderos (healers), who tend to specialize in the care of certain diseases; 2) herbalists, who use many of the materials used in traditional medicine; and 3) brujos, who are sorcerers and witches. Other plants used are osha, chuchupate-lovage; ponso or tanse-tansy; poleo-spearmint or pennyroyal mint; amolillo-wild licorice; dormilon-tall cone flower; malva; and, lanten-plantain. The least toxic abortifacients are species of Gossypium, Ruta, Ligusticum, Asclepias, and Rudbeckia."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["796747", "00073694"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: Journal of Ethnopharmacology"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Abortifacient Agents--side effects", "Abortion Seekers", "Abortion, Drug Induced", "Abortion, Induced", "Americas", "Cultural Background", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Demographic Factors", "Developed Countries", "Diseases", "Ethnic Groups", "Family Planning", "Fertility Control, Postconception", "Health", "Health Services", "Indians, North American", "Medicine", "Menstruation", "Nausea", "New Mexico", "North America", "Northern America", "Plants, Medicinal--therapeutic use", "Population", "Population Characteristics", "Reproduction", "Signs And Symptoms", "United States"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "232204", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1980", "Month": "06", "Day": "25"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "03"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0378-8741", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "1", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1979", "Month": "Oct"}}, "Title": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Ethnopharmacol"}, "ArticleTitle": "Plants used as abortifacients and emmenagogues by Spanish New Mexicans.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "241", "EndPage": "261", "MedlinePgn": "241-61"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Individuals of Spanish and Mexican descent in New Mexico have used a number of plants as emmenagogues and abortifacients.
