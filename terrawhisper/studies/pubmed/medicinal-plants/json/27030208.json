These plants and their phytomolecules, such as andrographolide, bacoside A and asiaticoside, were studied for their inhibition potential on pooled CYP450 as well as human CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP1A2 by CYP-CO complex assay and fluorogenic assay respectively followed by IC<sub>50</sub> determination. Quantification of bioactive compounds present in the extracts was done by RP-HPLC. Heavy metal content in the selected medicinal plants was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy.", "CYP-CO complex assay indicated significantly less inhibition potential than standard inhibitor (P < 0.05 and above). A. paniculata showed highest inhibitory activity against CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 63.06 \u00b1 1.35 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup> ; 88.80 \u00b1 3.32 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup> ), whereas C. asiatica and B. monnieri showed least inhibitory activity against CYP1A2 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 288.83 \u00b1 1.61 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup> ) and CYP2C9 (184.68 \u00b1 3.79 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup> ), respectively. In all cases the extract showed higher inhibition than the single bioactive compounds.
