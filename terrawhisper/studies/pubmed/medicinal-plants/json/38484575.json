This noteworthy partnership plays a pivotal role in sustaining plant well-being and enhancing plant adaptability across diverse habitats. Therefore, examining the diversity of endophytic microbes associated with their particular host plant is valuable for gaining insights into the vast spectrum of plant-microbe interactions. The present experiments aimed at investigating the bacterial endophytic diversity in both root and shoot tissues of Pelargonium graveolens, employing culture dependent and culture independent high-throughput metagenomics approach. A total of 614 and 620 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), encompassing 291 and 229 genera, were identified in the shoot and root tissues of P. graveolens, respectively. Furthermore, the subsequent classification of OTUs revealed 15 highly abundant phyla, with Proteobacteria dominating both root and shoot tissues. Notably, an exceptionally high abundance of Firmicutes phyla was observed in the shoot compared to the root. Additionally, 30 bacterial endophytes from the root, stem, petiole, and leaves were isolated and molecularly characterized, unveiling a consistent pattern of diversity distribution between the root and shoot of P. graveolens. Upon screening all isolates for plant growth promoting traits, Pseudomonas oryzihabitans was found to be positive for major biochemical test like nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization etc. and on inoculation resulted in about two-fold increase in content of essential oil accompanied by a significant rise in the geraniol and citronellol content. Diving deep into the genetic constitution of P. oryzihabitans unveiled a substantial number of genes directly and indirectly contributing to the endophyte's capability in colonizing host plants effectively. In summary, data obtained from metagenomics and culture dependent approaches including glass house trials suggest potential bacterial endophytes suitable for field applications for yield enhancement and in planta secondary metabolite enhancement investigations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier GmbH.
