Immunotherapy, which serves to assist the natural defenses of the body in eradicating cancerous cells, is a remarkable achievement that has revolutionized both cancer research and cancer treatments. Currently, the use of stem cells in immunotherapy is widespread and shares a special characteristic, including cancer cell migration, bioactive component release, and immunosuppressive activity. In the context of cancer, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are rapidly being identified as vital stromal regulators of tumor progression. MSCs therapy has been implicated in treating a wide range of diseases, including bone damage, autoimmune diseases, and particularly hematopoietic abnormalities, providing stem cell-based therapy with an extra dimension. Moreover, the implication of MSCs does not have ethical concerns, and the complications known in pluripotent and totipotent stem cells are less common in MSCs. MSCs have a lot of distinctive characteristics that, when coupled, make them excellent for cellular-based immunotherapy and as vehicles for gene and drug delivery in a variety of inflammations and malignancies. MSCs can migrate to the inflammatory site and exert immunomodulatory responses via cell-to-cell contacts with lymphocytes by generating soluble substances. In the current review, we discuss the most recent research on the immunological characteristics of MSCs, their use as immunomodulatory carriers, techniques for approving MSCs to adjust their immunological contour, and their usages as vehicles for delivering therapeutic as well as drugs and genes engineered to destroy tumor cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, School of Paramedical Sciences, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran."}], "LastName": "Taeb", "ForeName": "Shahram", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rostamzadeh", "ForeName": "Davoud", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mafi", "ForeName": "Sahar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3RE, United Kingdom."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lincoln College, University of Oxford, Turl Street, Oxford OX1 3DR, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Mofatteh", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Orta Mahalle, \u00dcniversite Caddesi No. 27, Orhanl\u0131, Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sabanci University Nanotechnology Research and Application Center (SUNUM), Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Zarrabi", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Hygiene and Quality Control, Division of Epidemiology & Zoonoses, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hushmandi", "ForeName": "Kiavash", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Safari", "ForeName": "Arash", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Radiology and Nuclear Medicine Department, School of Paramedical Sciences, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khodamoradi", "ForeName": "Ehsan", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Radiology and Nuclear Medicine Department, School of Paramedical Sciences, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Technology Research Center, Institute of Health Technology, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Najafi", "ForeName": "Masoud", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Mol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101093076", "ISSNLinking": "1566-5240"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mesenchymal Stem Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Autoimmune Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunomodulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36573062", "10.2174/1566524023666221226143814", "CMM-EPUB-128447"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
