A PLSR model was built from the obtained spectral data using 70% of the incensole working standard solutions (training set), ranging from 0.5 to 100\u00a0ppm. The PLSR model obtained has a R<sup>2</sup> value of 98% with a correlationship of 0.99 and a good prediction with root mean square error for prediction (RMSEP) value of 3.2%.", "The results indicated that the methanol (MeOH) extract of B. papyrifera resin has the highest concentration of incensole (18.4%) followed by n-hexane (13.5%) and ethyl acetate (3.6%) while trace amounts was detected in the fractions of B. sacra and no incensole was detected in the fractions of B. serrata.", "The findings are in total agreement with the HPLC analysis suggesting that NIR spectroscopy coupled with PLSR is a robust, rapid and non-destructive alternate method for the quantification of incensole in B. papyrifera.
