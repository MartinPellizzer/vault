A combined analysis of the fragmentation spectra of 3 purified standard basic taxoids and the substructure analysis of 139 previously reported taxoids provided information on typical primary and secondary product ions that are generated by CID mass spectrometry of basic taxoids. Precursor-scan analysis of selected product ions allowed for the detection of 57 basic taxoids from the ethyl acetate extract of T. wallichiana, 45 of which have not been reported. The method describe in this paper provides a fast method for the \"dereplication\" of natural products. The mass spectrometric data derived by this method was sufficient for the partial structure elucidation of novel basic taxoids. The method presented in this paper can be easily adapted into a high-throughput screening protocol for the identification and characterization of bioactive natural products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Institute, National Research Council of Canada, Montreal, Quebec."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stefanowicz", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prasain", "ForeName": "J K", "Initials": "JK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yeboah", "ForeName": "K F", "Initials": "KF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Konishi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P88XT4IS4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Paclitaxel"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Screening"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Paclitaxel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Taxus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11510822", "10.1021/ac010254i"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
