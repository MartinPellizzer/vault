In April 2021, a leaf spot disease was observed on Ligustrum japonicum in the campus of Anhui Agricultural University (31\u00b051'4\u2033N; 117\u00b014'54\u2033E), in Hefei City, Anhui Province, China. Approximately 50% of L. japonicum infections showed symptoms of round to oval, brown to dark brown lesions surrounded by a yellow halo. Diseased leaves were collected to determine the caused pathogen. Nine tissue pieces from three symptomatic leaves were surface sterilized with 2% NaClO for 1-2 minutes, followed by 75% ethanol for 1 minute, and then rinsed with sterile water for three times. The tissues samples were plated on potato dextrose agar\uff08PDA\uff09medium and incubated at 28 \u00b0C for 3 days. Seven fungal isolates were obtained from the plated tissues; the fungal hyphae were initially white and finally gray brown with flocculent aerial mycelia. Conidia were solitary or in chains, with various shapes, mostly subglobose. The size was (12.0-30.0) \u03bcm long and (6.0\uff5e12.0) \u03bcm wide (n=20). The cultural and morphological characteristics of these isolates were similar to those of Alternaria alternata (Simmons et al. 2007; Garibaldi et al. 2020). For accurate identification, genomic DNA was extracted from the mycelia of representative isolate (JSNZ). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS), 18S nrDNA (SSU), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (Tef1-\u03b1) and endopolygalacturonase (endoPG) sequences were amplified with the primer pairs of ITS1/ITS4, NS1/NS4, EFI-728F/EFI-986R and EPG-specific/EPG-3b, respectively (Woudenberg et al, 2013). The sequences were deposited in GeneBank under accessions MZ360963 (ITS), MZ677478 (SSU), OK274117(Tef1-\u03b1) and OK513186 (endoPG). BLAST analysis of the sequences of ITS, SSU, Tef1-\u03b1 and endoPG showed >99% identity with those of A. alternata MK108918(561/601bp), KX609765 (1030/1035bp), LC132712 (281/281bp) and MT185591(459/483bp), respectively. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was generated based on the concatenated data from sequences of ITS, SSU and Tef1-\u03b1 using MEGA5.1, which clustered the present isolate with A. alternata strain CBS916.96 with high bootstrap support (100%). Based on cultural characteristics and phylogenetic analysis, the current isolate associated with leaf spot of L. japonicum was identified as A. alternata. Pathogenicity test was performed on three healthy L. japonicum on campus. Three healthy leaves of each plant were wounded with one sterile needle and inoculated with a 5-mm-diameter mycelial plug using sterile PDA plugs as control. The inoculated plants were covered with plastic bags and sprayed with water every 24 hours to maintain a high temperature and humidity environment. The experiment was repeated three times. After 12-days of incubation, symptoms were apparent on pathogen-inoculated plants, while the control plants remained asymptomatic. A. alternata was reisolated from inoculated leaves and matched the morphological and molecular characteristics of the original isolates, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a leaf spot disease caused by A. alternata in L. japonicum in China. Its identification will establish a foundation for managing the disease in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "hefei, AnHui, China; 772979248@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "hefei, AnHui, China; S13856961946@163.COM."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Shuping", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hefei, China; 247390386@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Caiping", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Anhui Agricultural UniversityHefei, China, 230036; zhangyl@ahau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yinglao", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "26"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["35666223", "10.1094/PDIS-01-22-0068-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
