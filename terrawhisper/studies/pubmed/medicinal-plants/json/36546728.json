Hydroxytyrosol is one of the most potent antioxidants that served as control in the current study, including other synthetic antioxidants to computationally identify the antioxidant properties of Silymarin. The sequences of the receptors I\u03baB kinase (IKK), Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap-1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) were retrieved from UniProtKB and homology modeling was performed using Swiss-Model server. Thereof the molecular docking and dynamic simulation studies were performed using Schr\u00f6dinger's software version 11.5. From the current study, it was reported that on comparison of the binding energy of silymarin, hydroxytyrosol, \u03b1-tocopherol, ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxy anisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), Silymarin exhibited better affinities with IKK receptor followed by Hydroxytyrosol suggesting it as the best or comparable of all other known antioxidants that could potentially suppress inflammation and other diseases. Also, Silymarin exhibited poorest binding affinity with Tfam promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby scavenging ROS. However, with Keap-1, Silymarin is ranked 4<sup>th</sup> in the list, whereas hydroxytyrosol exhibited highest binding affinity to release oxidative stress. The stability of docked complexes made us conclude that Silymarin has comparable antioxidant properties to hydroxytyrosol, better anti-inflammatory potential and mitochondrial biogenesis enhancing properties to ultimately reduce oxidative stress. Now it can be tested further for <i>in\u00a0vitro or in\u00a0vivo</i> studies as potential drug against oxidative insult.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
