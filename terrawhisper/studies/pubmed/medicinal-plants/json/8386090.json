Thaliporphine (ED50 = 1.5 +/- 0.5 microM) was less potent than endothelin (ED50 = 3.9 +/- 0.4 nM), but was more potent than Bay K 8644 (ED50 = 5.5 +/- 0.6 microM). Thaliporphine also contracted guinea-pig trachea and ileum preparations, and increased the force of beating of rat left atria, but was less potent on these tissues than on rat aorta. Thaliporphine-induced contraction of rat aorta was not affected by prazosin (0.3 microM), atropine (1 microM), saralasin (10 microM) or ketanserin (10 microM). However, the contraction was slightly potentiated by the removal of endothelium. Preincubation of the rat aorta in Ca(2+)-free Krebs solution (containing 1 mM EGTA) for 15 min completely abolished thaliporphine-induced contractions, and the subsequent addition of 3 mM CaCl2 restored thaliporphine-induced contractions to the control level. In rat aorta, thaliporphine-induced contractions were significantly reduced by nifedipine (1-30 nM) or verapamil (0.01-0.3 microM), and significantly increased by Bay K 8644 (0.1 microM) or KCl (20 mM). The pA2 values for nifedipine and verapamil against thaliporphine-induced contractions were 9.4 +/- 0.1 and 8.4 +/- 0.2, respectively. The results indicate that thaliporphine exerts its vasoconstrictor effect on rat aorta mainly by promoting Ca2+ entry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Institute, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei."}], "LastName": "Teng", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ko", "ForeName": "F N", "Initials": "FN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "T F", "Initials": "TF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "1254354", "ISSNLinking": "0014-2999"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aporphines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vasoconstrictor Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5083-88-5", "NameOfSubstance": "thaliporphine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aorta, Thoracic"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Aporphines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Channels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ileum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Smooth"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vasoconstrictor Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8386090", "10.1016/0014-2999(93)90342-f", "0014-2999(93)90342-F"]}}]}
