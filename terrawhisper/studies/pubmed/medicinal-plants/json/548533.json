This method consists of two steps: firstly, purification and determination of total capsaicinoid by HPLC, and secondly, the simultaneous determination of capsaicin and its analogues by mass chromatography (MC) or mass fragmentography (MF). Crude extracts of capsaicinoid were purified with a Zorbax SIL column. Total capsaicinoid was detected at 235 nm and measured automatically by a microcomputer. It was collected, evaporated, trimethylsilylated and subjected to MC or MF. After monitoring the molecular ions of trimethylsilyl derivatives of capsaicinoid and the internal standard, the absolute contents of each analogue were determined by computer. By using this method, capsaicin and all of its analogues can be determined simultaneously at levels from micrograms to nanograms without any interferences from other components."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Iwai", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Suzuki", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fujiwake", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oka", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "0427043"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S07O44R1ZM", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsaicin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Capsaicin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microchemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "4", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["548533", "10.1016/s0021-9673(00)90966-x"]}}]}
