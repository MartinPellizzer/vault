The absence of specific treatments for cancerous cells significantly hinders the effectiveness of conventional anticancer techniques. Multiple research studies have demonstrated that the suppression of specific genes or the augmentation of therapeutic proteins through RNA-based therapeutics may represent a valuable approach when combined with chemotherapy or immunotherapy. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the application of RNA therapeutics in conjunction with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. This emerging field has become a prominent area of research for advancing various types of cancer treatments. The present investigation provides an in-depth overview of the classification and application of RNA therapy, focusing on the mechanisms of RNA antitumor treatment and the current status of clinical studies on RNA drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
