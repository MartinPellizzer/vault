Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are novel hybrid materials with amazing structural properties that make them a prominent material for adsorption.", "Zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 (ZIF-67), a water stable member of MOFs, with a truncated rhombic dodecahedron crystalline structure was synthesized in aqueous environment at room temperature and then characterized using XRD and SEM. PO<sub>4</sub> <sup>3-</sup> adsorption from synthetic solutions using ZIF-67 in batch mode were evaluated and a polynomial model (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.99, R<sup>2</sup> <sub>adj</sub>: 0.98, LOF: 0.1433) developed using response surface methodology (RSM).", "The highest PO<sub>4</sub> <sup>3-</sup> removal (99.2%) after model optimization obtained when ZIF-67 dose, pH and mixing time adjusted to 6.82, 832.4\u00a0mg/L and 39.95\u00a0min, respectively. The optimum PO<sub>4</sub> <sup>3-</sup> concentration in which highest PO<sub>4</sub> <sup>3-</sup> removal and lowest adsorbent utilization occurs, observed at 30\u00a0mg/L. PO<sub>4</sub> <sup>3-</sup> removal eclipsed significantly in the presence of carbonate. The equilibrium and kinetic models showed that PO<sub>4</sub> <sup>3-</sup> adsorbed in monolayer (q<sub>max</sub>: 92.43\u00a0mg/g) and the sorption process controlled in the sorption stage. Adsorption was also more favorable at higher PO<sub>4</sub> <sup>3-</sup> concentration, according to the separation factor (K<sub>R</sub>) graph.
