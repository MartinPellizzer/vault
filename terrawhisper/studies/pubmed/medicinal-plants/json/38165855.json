However, the activation mechanism and allosteric effects of SHP2 remain unclear, hindering the development of small molecule inhibitors. For the first time, in this study, the complex structure formed by the intact PD-1 tail and SHP2 was modeled. The molecular recognition and conformational changes of inactive/active SHP2 <i>versus</i> ITIM/ITSM were compared based on prolonged MD simulations. The relative flexibility of the two SH2 domains during MD simulations contributes to the recruitment of ITIM/ITSM and supports the subsequent conformational change of SHP2. The binding free energy calculation shows that inactive SHP2 has a higher affinity for ITIM/ITSM than active SHP2, mainly because the former's N-SH2 refers to the \u03b1-state. In addition, a significant decrease in the contribution to the binding energy of certain residues (<i>e.g.</i>, R32, S34, K35, T42, and K55) of conformationally transformed SHP2 contributes to the above result. These detailed changes during conformational transition will provide theoretical guidance for the molecular design of subsequent novel anticancer drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8905-5718"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Breast Disease Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610000, China. luotingwch@163.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Multi-omics Laboratory of Breast Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, National Collaborative, Innovation Center for Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Oncology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Ouyang", "ForeName": "Weiwei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources, Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9861-7436"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources, Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Lingkai", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources, Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhigang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources, Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Yue", "ForeName": "Xinru", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources, Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8943-4742"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources, Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jianping", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9670-4031"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Breast Disease Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610000, China. luotingwch@163.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Multi-omics Laboratory of Breast Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, National Collaborative, Innovation Center for Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.48", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "src Homology Domains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38165855", "10.1039/d3cp03923d"]}}]}
