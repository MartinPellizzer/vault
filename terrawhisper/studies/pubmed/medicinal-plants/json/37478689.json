In recent years, nanocellulose has emerged as a sustainable biomaterial for various medicinal applications including drug delivery systems, wound healing, tissue engineering, and antimicrobial treatment due to its biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, and exceptional water holding capacity for cell immobilization. Many antimicrobial products can be produced due to the chemical functionality of nanocellulose, such disposable antibacterial smart masks for healthcare use. This article discusses comprehensively three types of nanocellulose: cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), cellulose nanofibrils (CNF), and bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) in view of their structural and functional properties, extraction methods, and the distinctive biomedical applications based on the recently published work. On top of that, the biosafety profile and the future perspectives of nanocellulose-based biomaterials have been further discussed in this review."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
