The apparent binding constants of these derivatives with beta-CD were evaluated. After an optimization study, the best conditions were selected using 35 mM phosphate buffer (pH 11.0) containing 20 mM beta-CD and 2 M urea, applied voltage 20 kV and detection at 254 nm. Under such conditions, all of the five anthraquinones were baseline-separated within a short analysis time of 12 min with symmetrical peaks and high theoretical plate numbers (189,000-314,000). The RSD values of the migration times and peak areas were 0.6-1.1, 1.3-1.9% (intra-day) and 0.6-1.5, 1.3-2.8% (inter-day, for a 5-day period), respectively. The limits of detection for the analytes (S/N = 3) were 0.33-0.62 microg/ml. The recoveries were ranged from 93.37 to 107.69%. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of anthraquinones in ethanol extracts of two kinds of Rheum plants (R. palmatum and R. hotaoense) and P. cuspidatum."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Kan", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Huige", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xingguo", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Zhide", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Validation Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthraquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-Cyclodextrins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JV039JZZ3A", "NameOfSubstance": "betadex"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Anthraquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Capillary"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viscosity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "beta-Cyclodextrins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16806252", "10.1016/j.chroma.2006.04.021", "S0021-9673(06)00845-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
