And the rats of sham operation and Model groups were administered Vehicle (distilled water 0.8mL/200g/day). Firstly, the bone X-ray morphology and bone mineral density(BMD) of the fracture site were observed and measured after anesthesia the rats at weeks 2, 4, and 8 after surgery, then the serum levels of alkaline phosphatase(ALP) and osteocalcin (BGP) were measured; Secondly, the tissue morphology of the fracture site was observed after sacrificed the rats; Thirdly, the formation of mineralized nodules in bone marrow stromal cells(BMSC) were evaluated at week 2; Lastly, the genes levels of BMP-2 and Runx2 in the femur were detected at week 2 and 4, and the proteins expression of BMP-2 signaling pathway (BMP-2, BMPRIB, BMPRII and Runx2) in the femur also were detected at week 2.", "EE-rbSWH remarkably accelerated fracture healing by promoting bone formation at all the time points of fracture healing. Mainly by increasing the BMD level at the fracture site, the levels of serum ALP and BGP, and also the numbers increasing of calcified nodules in BMSC.
