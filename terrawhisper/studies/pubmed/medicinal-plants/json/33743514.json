The MMIP for selective and intelligent extraction of harmaline with excellent functionality and high selectivity was synthesized using the sol-gel method with functionalized superparamagnetic core-shell nanoparticles, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) as a cross-linker, methacrylic acid (MAA) as a functional monomer, and 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as a porogen. To study the properties and morphology of the coated polymer, FT-IR spectroscopy, FESEM, TEM images, and VSM were used. The DSPME-HPLC-UV equipment was used to quantify and analyze the data obtained from harmaline extraction. In this research, the efficiency of the synthesized polymer in harmaline extraction was modeled and optimized using the response surface methodology based on central composite design (RSM-CCD). In addition, for modeling the isotherm of harmaline sorption by the MMIP, Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm equations were used. The obtained results showed that the extraction of harmaline with the MMIP was well described with Freundlich isotherm. The results of the validation of the method showed that the measurement of harmaline in the concentration range of 1.0-4000\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> followed a linear relationship (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a09986.0). Moreover, the accuracy or repeatability index (% RSD) was determined to be\u00a0<\u00a010, and the LOQ and LOD values were 0.526 and 0.158\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The results of this study showed that the DSPME technique by using the synthesized MMIP as an effective sorbent with high efficiency and capacity could be utilized for pre-concentration and extraction of harmaline from real and complex samples."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
