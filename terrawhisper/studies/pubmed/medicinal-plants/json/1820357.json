As one hypothesis involves mycotoxins, a survey was carried out to investigate the possible involvement of the nephrotoxic mycotoxins ochratoxin A and citrinin. Recently, this survey was extended to screening for the presence of other mycotoxins--aflatoxins, citrinin, sterigmatocystin and zearalenone. A total of 524 samples of home-produced and home-stored beans and maize from the harvests of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1989 and 1990 were analysed. Ochratoxin A was found in samples from both endemic and nonendemic areas, but more of the samples from affected families were contaminated, and at higher levels, than those from unaffected households. Citrinin and aflatoxins B1 and G1 were also found more frequently in samples from endemic areas. These results support the theory that mycotoxins are involved in the etiology of Balkan endemic nephropathy and urinary tract tumours."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Oncological Centre, Sofia, Bulgaria."}], "LastName": "Petkova-Bocharova", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Castegnaro", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Michelon", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maru", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "IARC Sci Publ", "NlmUniqueID": "8009542", "ISSNLinking": "0300-5038"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mycotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ochratoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1779SX6LUY", "NameOfSubstance": "ochratoxin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3S697X6SNZ", "NameOfSubstance": "Citrinin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Balkan Nephropathy"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bulgaria"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Citrinin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cluster Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mycotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ochratoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Urologic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1820357"]}}]}
