A liquid-liquid extraction with CH2Cl2-methanol (90 + 10, v/v) and a cleanup step with Florisil were combined with LC to isolate, recover, and quantitate the pesticide. Average recoveries obtained at spike levels of 0.03 and 0.40 mg/kg were 83.2-84.7% for tomatoes and 83.3-87.5% for green beans. Determination limits were 0.03 mg/kg for tomatoes and 0.01 mg/kg for green beans. Levels of methomyl residues were studied in tomatoes and green beans grown in an experimental greenhouse to establish the effect of the kind of greenhouse, application dose, species grown, and climatic conditions on the degradation of this pesticide. Analysis of variance showed that doses did not affect the response. The half-life, however, is greater in a flat-roof greenhouse than in an asymmetric-roof greenhouse and is significantly longer for green beans than for tomatoes and longer in winter than in spring. A preharvest time of about 5 days may be suitable for green beans sprayed with methomyl. Tomatoes show residue levels at the time of application lower than Spanish minimum residue levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Almeria, Department of Analytical Chemistry, Spain."}], "LastName": "Gil Garcia", "ForeName": "M D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mart\u00ednez Vidal", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mart\u00ednez Galera", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rodr\u00edguez Torreblanca", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gonzalez", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J AOAC Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9215446", "ISSNLinking": "1060-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1NQ08HN02S", "NameOfSubstance": "Methomyl"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methomyl"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9170659"]}}]}
