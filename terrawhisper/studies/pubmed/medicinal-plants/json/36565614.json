Rutin is a therapeutic flavonol which is massively accumulated in Tartary buckwheat. It has been demonstrated that transcription factors control rutin biosynthesis. However, the transcriptional regulatory network of rutin is not fully clear. In this study, through transcriptome and target metabolomics, we validated the role of FtMYB102 and FtbHLH4 TFs at the different developmental stages of Tartary buckwheat. The elevated accumulation of rutin in the sprout appears to be closely associated with the expression of FtMYB102 and FtbHLH4. Yeast two-hybrid, transient luciferase activity and co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that FtMYB102 and FtbHLH4 can interact and form a transcriptional complex. Moreover, yeast one-hybrid showed that both FtMYB102 and FtbHLH4 directly bind to the promoter of chalcone isomerase (CHI), and they can coordinately induce CHI expression as shown by transient luciferase activity assay. Finally, we transferred FtMYB102 and FtbHLH4 into the hairy roots of Tartary buckwheat and found that they both can promote the accumulation of rutin. Our results indicate that FtMYB102 and FtbHLH4 can form a transcriptional complex by inducing CHI expression to coordinately promote the accumulation of rutin."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.
