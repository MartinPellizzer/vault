The method firstly performs the qualitative analyses of the attribution ratios, and then the quantitative analyses, which can successfully disclose the results of attribution ratio and determine the process recovery of the medicinal effective components for TCM-compound prescription. Three optional methods were represented to assess the amount and distribution proportion of chemical compositions for single crude drug to compound prescription. In terms of components absorbed ultraviolet light, S5 (Radix Scutellariae) was assessed to be the most important crude drug containing much more effective components, and S7 (Radix Gentianae), S4 (Flos Lonicerae Japonica), S8 (Rhizome Anemarrhena) and S9 (Fructus Gardeniae) were second important crude drugs. The results showed lower process recovery of the medicinal effective components for eight batches of marketed preparations. Above all, the quantified fingerprint method can objectively and accurately reflect how high is the contribution of a single crude drug to the compound prescription, and quantitatively evaluate the process recovery of medicinal effectiveness components."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China. gxswmwys@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Guo-xiang", "Initials": "GX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Xiang-fen", "Initials": "XF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jing-xian", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bi", "ForeName": "Kai-shun", "Initials": "KS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19127870"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
