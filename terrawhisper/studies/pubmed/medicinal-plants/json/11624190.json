The authentic character of mesir in view of medical and cultural history. Merkez Efendi who lived in Manisa (Anatolia) in the late 15th century was a man of religion initiating novices at Hafsa Sultan lodge, and upon Shaikh Sumbul Efendi's decease came to Istanbul, so as to take the lead of his religious order. It was believed that he invented a special paste called \"mesir\" in Manisa, which was a sort of antidote; and on this occasion he was appointed as the chief physician to the darussifa (hospital), then. The historical facts do not support this information, because the discovery of the mesir paste goes back to a thousand and a half years before Merkez Efendi's time, since it was mentioned by Hippocrates, Galen, ancient Greek and old Islamic (Avicenna's and others') works. On the other hand, this fact does not change the folkoric rites and beliefs originated in Manisa and about Merkez Efendi; as this city, together with its surroundings, was the center of the Kyberle (Phyrigia) myth which originates with the Attis spring banquets which symbolize the awakening of Nature on March 21st by the casting of various flowers, especially violets to the river Phyrigia, Sangarios (Sakarya River now). The casting of the mesir paste from the minarets of mosques in Manisa every spring is probably the continuation of the same belief in Anatolia, today."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ege Tip Fakultesi, Deontoloji ve Tip Tarihi Anabilim Dali Baskani."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bayat", "ForeName": "A H", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Biography", "English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Mithridates'ten Mesir'e."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Turkey", "MedlineTA": "Yeni Tip Tarihi Arastirmalari", "NlmUniqueID": "9703828", "ISSNLinking": "1300-669X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidotes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antidotes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Folklore"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Early Modern 1451-1600"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Medieval"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Modern 1601-"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}], "PersonalNameSubjectList": [{"LastName": "Efendi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11624190"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
