During a vegetation period we monitored the time course of the levels of artemisinin, its direct precursors, the biosynthetically related sesquiterpenes and the essential oil content in the diploid (wild-type) and tetraploid A. annua plants. The averaged artemisinin level in tetraploids was 38% higher than that of the wild-type as measured over the whole vegetation period. In contrast, the averaged essential oil content of the tetraploids over this period was 32% lower. This might suggest a reciprocal correlation between artemisinin (sesquiterpenes) and the essential oil content (monoterpenes). The averaged biomass of the leaves of the tetraploid plants was lower compared to the wild-type plants. Therefore, the artemisinin yield per m2 tetraploids was decreased by 25%. Although the tetraploid plants were smaller than the wild-type plants, certain individual organs like the leaves were considerably larger, and seeds obtained by cross pollination between tetraploid A. annua plants had a spectacular size. In principle, tetraploid A. annua can be a useful starting material for a breeding program in order to obtain larger and faster growing plants, which produce higher levels of artemisinin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, University Centre for Pharmacy, Groningen Institute for Drug Studies, University of Groningen, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eelco Wallaart", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pras", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Quax", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Artemisinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9RMU91N5K2", "NameOfSubstance": "artemisinin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artemisinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ploidies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10630114", "10.1055/s-1999-14094"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
