The serum amylase was significantly higher than that of the control saline group (P less than 0.001 after 24h; P less than 0.05 after 48h). The aggregation function of platelets were increased after 24h(P less than 0.01, P less than 0.01) and 48h (P less than 0.01, P less than 0.05) as compared with both two control groups. The blood stasis and hemorrhage of pancreases were observed in the model group. In the treatment group with Rhubarb the increase of serum amylase was much less marked than the control (P less than 0.001 after 24h, P less than 0.05 after 48h). The platelet aggregation reactivity was inhibited (P less than 0.01 after 24h, P less than 0.05 after 48h). The blood stasis and hemorrhage of pancreases were less evident. The results suggested that: (1) the virus may be one of pathogenetic factor of the hemorrhagic pancreatitis; (2) the rhubarb was effective in the treatment of hemorrhagic pancreatitis under our experimental conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Friendship Hospital."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8207427", "ISSNLinking": "0254-9034"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Measles Vaccine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Amylases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Amylases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Measles Vaccine"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "etiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pancreatitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rheum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1696182"]}}]}
