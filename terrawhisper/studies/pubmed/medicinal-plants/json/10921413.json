Lipid obtained from stored polished rice or rice bran was ulcerogenic. Further animal experiments were designed to investigate the protective and healing effects of Horse gram lipid (HGL) against peptic ulceration.", "Three effects were investigated in rats: (i) the protective effect of HGL on peptic ulceration produced by using pyloric ligation in combination with South Indian diet or rice bran oil, or by cysteamine, alcohol or aspirin; (ii) the effect of HGL on mast cell degranulation in response to pyloric ligation and rice bran oil; and (iii) the healing effect of HGL on acute gastric ulceration produced by alcohol, on chronic gastric ulceration produced by topical acetic acid or on chronic duodenal ulcer following cysteamine.", "Horse gram lipid was shown to be protective and to promote ulcer healing in all the models used. Mast cell degranulation was inhibited.", "The experiments confirm the presence of a lipid in certain staple foods that have protective and healing properties in experimental peptic ulcer animal models. The differences in the prevalence of duodenal ulceration between different regions in some developing countries with a high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection might be explained by the presence or absence of protective lipids or ulcerogenic factors in the staple diet."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Royal Free and University College Medical School, London, United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jayaraj", "ForeName": "A P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tovey", "ForeName": "F I", "Initials": "FI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lewin", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clark", "ForeName": "C G", "Initials": "CG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "J Gastroenterol Hepatol", "NlmUniqueID": "8607909", "ISSNLinking": "0815-9319"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5UX2SD1KE2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cysteamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Degranulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cysteamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology", "physiopathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Duodenal Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ligation"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mast Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pylorus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10921413", "10.1046/j.1440-1746.2000.02214.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
