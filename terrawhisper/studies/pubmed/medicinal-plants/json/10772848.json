Diffusion and reaction processes supply and consume substrates within cells and determine their steady-state concentrations. To realistically represent these processes by computer simulation they must be modeled in three dimensions. Yet three-dimensional models are inherently computing intensive. This study describes a method, which substantially simplifies the modeling of diffusion into a polyhedral body (a cube), that was used as a model representation of a cell. The method is applied to a case study of oxygen diffusion into nitrogen-fixing, rhizobia-infected cells in legume nodules. The method involved generating a one-dimensional representation of the three-dimensional problem to provide a \"surface area profile\" of three-dimensional diffusion. The one-dimensional models were significantly easier to program, several orders of magnitude faster to solve and in this study were validated by assessing their results against those of comparable three-dimensional models of diffusion into the same body. The results show the one-dimensional method to be a close approximation of a three-dimensional source-sink problem with systematic differences below 10% for fractional oxygenation of leghemoglobin, cell respiration and nitrogenase activity. Larger differences between models (up to 45%) in the predicted average and innermost O(2)concentrations had no effects on the physiological conclusions of the study, but were attributed to the poorer resolution of the three- than the one-dimensional model, and to an inherent simplification in the derivation of the one-dimensional surface area profiles. The one-dimensional modeling approach was found to be a simple, yet powerful tool for the study of diffusion and reaction in biological systems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2000 Academic Press."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Centre for Legumes in Mediterranean Agriculture (CLIMA), The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, 6907, Australia. thumfort@mit.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thumfort", "ForeName": "P P", "Initials": "PP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Layzell", "ForeName": "D B", "Initials": "DB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Atkins", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Theor Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376342", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5193"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diffusion"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10772848", "10.1006/jtbi.2000.1071", "S0022-5193(00)91071-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
