However, little toxicological information has been reported and its use is based on the fact that this bicyclic sesquiterpene is daily consumed as a plant food in much larger quantities than as a food additive. Thus, this study evaluated acute (14-day) and repeated-dose (28 days) oral \u03b2-caryophyllene toxicity in female Swiss mice analyzing changes in body weight, food intake, water intake, hematological and biochemical parameters, organ weight after necropsy, oxidative stress markers and histopathology of various tissues. Acute (300 and 2000\u202fmg/kg) and repeated-dose (300 and 2000\u202fmg/kg) toxicity studies were performed according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guideline 423 and 407, respectively. There was absence of adverse clinical signs and mortality in any animal subjected to acute and repeated-dose toxicity study. In addition, no significant changes in body weight, food and water intake, oxidative stress biomarkers, hematological and biochemical parameters were observed when compared to control group from single-dose and repeated-dose toxicity study. Therefore, the results of this study provide an understanding of the toxicity profile of \u03b2-caryophyllene which can be considered a compound with toxicity at doses higher than 2000\u202fmg/kg body weight."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.
