With regard to Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles, all sorbents were identified by SEM, TEM, and XRD. In addition, the influence of different parameters such as pH, ferrofluid volume, ionic strong (NaCl concentration %), and vortex time was investigated and optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite design (CCD). Maximum MFA extraction predicted by RSM (97.66) was achieved at pH 4.0, 60\u202f\u03bcL of ferrofluid, 3%w/v NaCl, and 7\u202fmin vortex time with desirability of 1.0. Under the optimized conditions, the limits of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were 1.351\u202fng\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup> and 4.575\u202fng\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The intra-day and inter-day precision (RSD [relative standard deviation]%) in the concentrations of 50, 300, and 700\u202fng\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup> of MFA were less than 3.6% and 4.2%, respectively. The method developed in our study could successfully determine MFA in urine samples. The MFA microextraction in urine samples were between 80.25 and 97.44% with RSD% less than 4.60%. Inclusion of ferrofluid in a miniaturized method for sample preparation is proportional to the achievement of high microextraction percentage using green analytical method."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
