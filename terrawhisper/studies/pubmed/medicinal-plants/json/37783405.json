How many medicinal plant species have been recorded for Mozambique? Of those, how many are indigenous to Mozambique, and how many are introduced or cultivated exotics? 2. What are the main medicinal uses in Mozambique and which species are used for which ailments? 3. What are the similarities and differences between the medicinal floras of Mozambique and South Africa - are the same species used for the same ailments and is there evidence of cultural exchange? 4. Do the data provide new insights into Traditional African Medicine as one of the oldest medicine systems in the world?", "A literature survey was done to compile the medicinal checklist of Mozambique using 29 available literature sources, which were found from published books, journal articles, reports, unpublished theses, dissertations, and online databases.", "A total of 731 medicinal plant species and infraspecific taxa from 447 genera and 120 families was recorded for Mozambique. Of these, 590 (81%) are indigenous, and 87 are non-indigenous (50 naturalised and 37 cultivated exotics). Of the 731 medicinal plant species, 494 (68%) are also used medicinally in South Africa and 148 (30%) are used for the same or similar ailments. Many of the shared taxa and uses have been recorded in the adjoining KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa, which has similar vegetation types.", "The similarity between Mozambique and South Africa (and especially the KwaZulu-Natal Province) not only suggest an exchange of traditional knowledge but also indicates the existence of a hitherto unnamed medicinal system of the southern and eastern African Bantu-speaking cultures that is in need of detailed comparative studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
