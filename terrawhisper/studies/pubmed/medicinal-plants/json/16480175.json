The currently available ones have many drawbacks including high cost, side effects and toxicity. Several novel approaches are on to locate a potent radioprotector. These include mimics of antioxidant enzymes, nitroxides, melatonin, growth factors, gene therapy, hyperthermia apart from natural products. The latter has several advantages since they are non-toxic with proven therapeutic benefits. These can be classified as natural compounds and plant extracts; polyherbal formulations; besides natural and semi-natural compounds of plant origin. A review of the above agents, their efficacy in radioprotection and possible mechanisms responsible has been carried out. As India and many Eastern countries have an enormous heritage of vast natural dietary and time tested medicinal resources it is worth exploring the possibility of developing efficient, economically viable and clinically acceptable radioprotectors for human application from these resources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Radiation Biology and Health Sciences Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maurya", "ForeName": "Dharmendra K", "Initials": "DK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Devasagayam", "ForeName": "Thomas P A", "Initials": "TP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "Cherupally Krishnan K", "Initials": "CK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Power Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Injuries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiation, Ionizing"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiotherapy"}], "NumberOfReferences": "219"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16480175"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
