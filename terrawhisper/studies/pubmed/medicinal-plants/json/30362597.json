ALA plays an important role in scavenging intracellular radicals and inflammatory elements. AL-1 is found in herbal medicines with potent anti-inflammatory properties. Data were collected from the Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Evidence-based medicine/clinical trials, and Cochrane library database until 2017, which finally resulted in 22 animal studies (70 rats and 162 mice). The beneficial effects of ALA or AL-1 on the most important parameters of UC were reviewed; also, studies were considered separately in mice and rats. Administration of ALA and AL-1 significantly reduced the tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 level compared with the controls, while data were not noteworthy in the meta-analysis (mean differences\u2009=\u2009-18.57 [95% CI\u2009=\u2009-42.65 to 5.51], P\u2009=\u20090.13). In spite of insignificant decrease in meta-analysis outcomes (differences\u2009=\u20096.92 [95% CI\u2009=\u2009-39.33 to 53.16], P\u2009=\u20090.77), a significant reduction in myeloperoxidase activity was shown following ALA or AL-1 treatment compared with the controls. Despite significant differences in each study, we had to exclude some studies to homogenize data for meta-analyzing as they showed\u00a0insignificant results. Interleukin 6, cyclooxygenase-2, glutathione, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, histopathological score, macroscopic and microscopic scores, disease activity index, body weight change, and colon length were also reviewed. Most studies have emphasized on significant positive effects of ALA and AL-1. Comprehensive clinical trials are obligatory to determine the precious position of ALA or AL-1 in the management of UC."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology and Diseases Group, The Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (TIPS), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moeinian", "ForeName": "Mahsa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9961-9097"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology and Diseases Group, The Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (TIPS), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Institute of Medicinal Plants, ACECR, Karaj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gastrointestinal Pharmacology Interest Group (GPIG), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abdolghaffari", "ForeName": "Amir Hossein", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5206-6197"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology and Diseases Group, The Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (TIPS), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacoeconomics and Pharmaceutical Administration, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nikfar", "ForeName": "Shekoufeh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3957-3300"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology and Diseases Group, The Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (TIPS), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Institute of Medicinal Plants, ACECR, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Momtaz", "ForeName": "Saeideh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0123-1209"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology and Diseases Group, The Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (TIPS), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abdollahi", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "8205768", "ISSNLinking": "0730-2312"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "73Y7P0K73Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Thioctic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Colitis, Ulcerative"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Thioctic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30362597", "10.1002/jcb.27807"]}}]}
