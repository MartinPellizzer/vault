In the traditional system of medicine in India, the formulation has been prescribed for intestinal disorders. It comprises of five medicinal herbs, namely, Boerhavia diffusa, Berberis aristata, Tinospora cordifolia, Terminalia chebula and Zingiber officinale. The dried and pulverized plants were extracted in ethanol together and individually. In vitro amoebicidal activity was studied to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of all the constituent extracts as well as the whole formulation. The formulation had a MIC of 1000 micrograms/ml as compared with 10 micrograms/ml for metronidazole. In experimental caecal amoebiasis in rats the formulation had a curative rate of 89% with the average degree of infection (ADI) reduced to 0.4 in a group dosed with 500 mg/kg per day as compared with ADI of 3.8 for the sham-treated control group of rats. Metronidazole had a cure rate of 89% (ADI = 0.4) at a dose of 100 mg/kg per day and cured the infection completely (ADI = 0) when the dosage was doubled to 200 mg/kg per day. There were varying degrees of inhibition of the following enzyme activities of crude extracts of axenically cultured amoebae: DNase, RNase, aldolase, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, alpha-amylase and protease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbiology Department, CHM College, University of Bombay, India."}], "LastName": "Sohni", "ForeName": "Y R", "Initials": "YR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kaimal", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bhatt", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amebicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "140QMO216E", "NameOfSubstance": "Metronidazole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Deoxyribonucleases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaline Phosphatase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Acid Phosphatase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Amylases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.2.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acid Phosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaline Phosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Amebicides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Cecum"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Deoxyribonucleases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Entamoeba histolytica"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Entamoebiasis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Metronidazole"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Amylases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7739226", "10.1016/0378-8741(94)01194-5", "0378874194011945"]}}]}
