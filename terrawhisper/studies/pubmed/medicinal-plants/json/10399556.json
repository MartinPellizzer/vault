(cult. Volnushka) and in soft wheat Triticum aestivum L. (cult. Super Dwarf) there has been studied dynamics of accumulating biomass in the ontogenesis in accordance with the value of water potential in the root-habitable medium. Besides, in wheat there has been investigated the process of forming the grain crop capacity in a period between V and XII stages of the organogenesis from Kuperman's classification. The plants have been grown in the root modules with the perlite used as a substitute for soil and with water supply through the porous hydrophilic membranes. The levels of water potential in the root-habitable medium, namely in the perlite, were kept unchanged in the range from -0.5 to -13 kPa (or from -5 to -130 cm water column) which corresponded to volumetric humidity ranged from 63 to 25%. Tests exposition was in the range of 13 to 78 and 25 to 46 days for wheat and mustard, respectively. The value of upper limit of an allowable water potential was determined from the magnitude of critical pressure of the puncture at which the most large through pores in the perlite layer break free of water, the value of lower limit was determined after criterion of a significant decrease in the plants harvest. In accordance with the paper results an allowable range of water potential in a perlite-based root-habitable medium ranged from -1.0 to -2.0 kPa which was in agreement with the range of volume humidity from 61% to 51%. In decreasing the water potential beyond the lower limit of mentioned range to -3.0 kPa, the mass of mustard shoots has reduced by 30% and the wheat crop was not good. The elaborated procedure and equipment can be used for determining the thresholds of permissible water potentials (humidity) for any soil substitutes irrespective of the construction of root module and the species of cultivated plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Berkovich", "ForeName": "Iu A", "Initials": "IuA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krivobok", "ForeName": "N M", "Initials": "NM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smolianina", "ForeName": "S O", "Initials": "SO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ivanov", "ForeName": "V B", "Initials": "VB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhilenkova", "ForeName": "O G", "Initials": "OG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bol'shakova", "ForeName": "L S", "Initials": "LS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Vliianie vodnogo potentsiala v korneobitaemo\u012d zone na produktivnost' vysshikh rasteni\u012d."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Aviakosm Ekolog Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9305904", "ISSNLinking": "0233-528X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Mustard Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10399556"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
