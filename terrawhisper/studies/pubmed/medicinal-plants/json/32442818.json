In the given study, a series of eighteen new (3a-r) 3-ethoxy salicylaldehyde-based thiosemicarbazones (TSC), bearing aryl and cycloalkyl substituents, were synthesized and assayed for their pharmacological potential against carbonic anhydrases (hCA I and hCA II), cholinesterases (AChE and BChE) and \u03b1-glycosidase. The hCA I isoform was inhibited by these novel 3-ethoxysalicylaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derivatives (3a-r) in low nanomolar levels, the Ki of which differed between 144.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.74 and 454.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a048.32\u00a0nM. Against the physiologically dominant isoform hCA II, the novel compounds demonstrated K<sub>i</sub>s varying from 110.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.05 to 444.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a036.08\u00a0nM. Also, these novel derivatives (3a-r) effectively inhibited AChE, with Ki values in the range of 385.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a045.03 to 983.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0104.64\u00a0nM. For BChE was obtained with Ki values in the range of 400.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a035.68 to 1003.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0154.27\u00a0nM. For \u03b1-glycosidase the most effective Ki values of 3l, 3n, and 3q were with Ki values of 12.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.05, 16.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.84, and 19.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.66\u00a0nM, respectively. Moreover, the synthesized TCSs were simulated using force field methods whereas the binding energies of the selected compounds were estimated using MM-GBSA method. The findings indicate the present novel 3-ethoxy salicylaldehyde-based thiosemicarbazones to be excellent hits for pharmaceutical applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
