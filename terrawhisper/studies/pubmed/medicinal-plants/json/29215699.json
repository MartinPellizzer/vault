GEO database was used to download gene expression data related with SCE (GSE50161 and GSE66354) and annotation file. LncRNA with differential expression was predicted by Multi Experiment Matrix website (MEM). The target gene was analyzed by KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. SCE tissues and adjacent tissues were collected. The positive expression of CACNG5 protein was tested by immunohistochemistry. Expression of LINC00880, CACNG5, and MAPK signaling pathway-related proteins was measured with qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cycle, and apoptosis were detected using MTT, Transwell assay, Scratch test, and Flow cytometry. SCE tissues showed increased LINC00880 expression. CACNG5 was a target gene of LINC00880 and correlated with MAPK signaling pathway. Compared with adjacent tissues, SCE tissues showed lower positive expression of CACNG5. Compared with the blank group, LINC00880 expression was higher in the LINC00880 vector and LINC00880 vector\u2009+\u2009CACNG5 vector groups, and lower in the si-LINC00880 and si-LINC00880\u2009+\u2009si-CACNG5 groups; in the LINC00880 vector and si-CACNG5 groups, expression of survivin, p38MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK1/2/3 increased and CACNG5 and Bax expression reduced, the proliferation, invasion and migration of tumor cells increased, and apoptosis rate decreased. Opposite results were found in the si-LINC00880 and CACNG5 vector groups. The findings indicate that lncRNA LINC00880 targeting CACNG5 inhibits cell apoptosis and promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion in SCE through the MAPK signaling pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Biotechnology on Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Science, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou, P.R.
