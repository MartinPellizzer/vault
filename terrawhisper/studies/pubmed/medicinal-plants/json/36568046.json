The objective of the study was to analyze proximate compositions and micronutrients value, as well as, to evaluate biological activities including, antioxidant and anticancer activities of <i>A. concinna</i> leaves in Thailand. Proximate composition and micronutrients value were determined relative to the Association of Official Analytical Chemists standard methodology. Antioxidant capacity was examined following oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. Anticancer activity was determined following resazurin microplate assay. Proximate composition of <i>A. concinna</i> leaves including crude protein and dietary fiber constituted 6.73 \u00b1 0.03 g and 9.15 \u00b1 0.03 g/100 g sample. Energy constituted 113.00 \u00b1 3.61 kcal/100 g sample. Its leaves also had the highest micronutrients value on calcium, with constituted 321.38 \u00b1 4.29 mg/100 g sample. <i>A. concinna</i> leaves hold antioxidant capacity with ORAC and FRAP values of 20407.55 \u00b1 74.23 \u03bcmoles and 1016.38 \u00b1 29.29 \u03bcmoles TE/100 g sample, respectively. Its ethanolic extract holds slightly anticancer effect against tested cancerous cell lines. <i>A. concinna</i> can be a healthy alternative source of nutrients with good antioxidant capacity and slightly anticancer properties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2022 Journal of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology & Research."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Thai Traditional Medicine, School of Integrative Medicine, Mae Fah Luang University, Chiang Rai, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Ganogpichayagrai", "ForeName": "Aunyachulee", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Sports and Health Science, School of Health Science, Mae Fah Luang University, Chiang Rai, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Suksaard", "ForeName": "Chutinan", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Adv Pharm Technol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101537797", "ISSNLinking": "0976-2094"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Gupta GL, Nigam SS.
