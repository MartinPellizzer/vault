Polysaccharides extracted from <i>B. striata</i> have been shown to have an effect on Alzheimer's disease (Lin et al. 2021). Since 2021, leaf spots have been observed in the <i>B. striata</i> plantation in Chongqing, China. Out of 200 plants, the disease incidence was estimated at 56%, and the disease index was estimated at 32%. The symptoms were necrotic lesions with brown edges and yellow halos; severe infection caused the infected leaves to become blighted, dry and fall off. To identify the causal agent, eighteen leaves with typical symptoms were collected from the <i>B. striata</i> plantation (30.60\u00b0N, 108.64\u00b0E). The margins of infected tissue areas were cut into small pieces (5\u00d75 mm), surface sterilized with 70% ethanol for 1 min, and rinsed twice with sterile distilled water. The tissue was then surface sterilized in 3% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min, followed by three rinses with sterile water. The tissue was then placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 3 days, pure cultures of fungal isolates were obtained by single-spore isolation, stored on PDA slants and maintained at 4\u00b0C. Colonies of the fungal isolates showed three color types, ranging from grayish white to green above with olive green on the reverse, but conidial characteristics were more similar and indicated this was a single fungus. Conidiophores were single, lateral from hyphae or terminal; straight or curved; smooth-walled with 1 to 8 septa; pale brown; usually with only one pigmented terminal conidiogenous site, sometimes with one additional lateral conidiogenous locus; sometimes slightly swollen at the apex; and 15 to 170 \u03bcm long, 2.5 to 4.5 \u03bcm wide. Conidia were in short or moderately long chains of 2-8 conidia normally, sometimes with more; rarely branched; normally 14.07 to 50 \u00d7 5.24 to 10 \u03bcm in size; ellipsoid, fusiform, long ellipsoid, obclavate or ovoid with 1 to 11 transverse septa and 2 to 4 longitudinal septa; beakless or with subcylindric or cylindric secondary conidiophores, analogous to the beak 4.25 to 58.6 \u03bcm long, 3.2 to 4.8 \u03bcm wide. The fungal isolates were tentatively identified as <i>Alternaria</i> sp. The representative isolate BJ8 was selected for the pathogenicity test. The leaves of six healthy plants of <i>B. striata</i> (two years old) grown in pots were washed with sterile water. Ten mL of conidial suspension (1\u00d710<i>6</i> conidia mL<i>-1</i>) contained in 0.05% Tween 80 buffer was brushed onto upper and lower surfaces of all the leaves on three plants, while other plants were brushed with 10 mL 0.05% Tween 80 buffer to serve as controls. Plants were placed in a greenhouse at 25\u00b0C and 95\u00b11% relative humidity after inoculation and observed for symptoms. The symptoms initially developed as irregular brown necrotic lesions on the inoculated leaves after 7 days, with a yellow halo around the lesions, consistent with the symptoms in the field. Leaves on the control plants did not produce any symptoms. For molecular identification, the genomic DNAs of representative isolates BJ5, BJ6, and BJ8 were extracted. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (<i>RPB2</i>), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (<i>TEF1</i>), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<i>GAPDH</i>) genes were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using primers ITS5/ITS4, GPD1/GPD2, EF-1F/EF-1B and RPB27cR/RPB25F2, respectively (White et al. 1990; Berbee and Pirseyedi et al. 1999; Carbone and Kohn 1999; Liu et al. 1999). The neighbor-joining tree revealed that these isolates are clustered together with the reference strain of <i>A. burnsii</i>. The sequences were deposited in NCBI GenBank BJ5 [ITS: OP897263; <i>GAPDH</i>: OQ544937; <i>TEF1</i>: OQ544941; <i>RPB2</i>: OQ544939], BJ6 [ITS: OP897262; <i>GAPDH</i>: OQ544938; <i>TEF1</i>: OQ544942; <i>RPB2</i>: OQ544940], and BJ8 [ITS: OK285209; <i>GAPDH</i>: OK340046; <i>TEF1</i>: OK340047; <i>RPB2</i>: OQ544936]. All three isolates showed 100% similarity with <i>A. burnsii</i> CBS 107.38 [ITS: KP124420; <i>GAPDH</i>: JQ646305; <i>TEF1</i>: KP125198; <i>RPB2</i>: JQ646457] ex-type sequence, thus the pathogen causing the leaf spot on <i>B. striata</i> was identified as <i>A. burnsii</i>. <i>A. burnsii</i> is an important pathogenic fungus causing blight of <i>cumin</i> (Shekhawat et al. 2013). Furthermore, Al-Nadabi et al. (2018) found that <i>A. burnsii</i> can cause leaf spots on wheat and date palms, and Sunapao et al. (2022) reported that <i>A. burnsii</i> can infect coconuts (<i>Cocos nucifera</i>), causing dirty panicle disease. This is the first report of <i>A. burnsii</i> causing leaf spot on <i>B. striata</i> in China. The new discovery shows that since <i>A. burnsii</i> can readily adapt to a variety of climatic conditions, controlling the fungus is crucial for the healthy growth of <i>B. striata</i> in the future. This study will provide a basis for further elucidating the pathogenic mechanism and development of effective control measures for this disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Three Gorges University, 372323, College of Biological and Food Engineering, tianxing street, Wanzhou, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China, 404120."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Three Gorges University, 372323, Engineering Laboratory for Green Cultivation and Deep Processing of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area's Medicinal Herbs, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China; 20200002@sanxiau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Fuqiang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Three Gorges University, 372323, College of Biological and Food Engineering, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China; mwl313537@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Wanli", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Three Gorges University, 372323, College of Biological and Food Engineering, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China; 615967380@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Dan", "ForeName": "Yurou", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Three Gorges University, 372323, College of Biological and Food Engineering, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China; 1483942206@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Zixuan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Three Gorges University, 372323, College of Biological and Food Engineering, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China; songzhen0317@163.com."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Zhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Three Gorges University, 372323, College of Biological and Food Engineering, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China; Xuqin9262023@163.com."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Three Gorges University, 372323, College of Biological and Food Engineering, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Three Gorges University, 372323, Engineering Laboratory for Green Cultivation and Deep Processing of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area's Medicinal Herbs, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China; liuming780906@163.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37700475", "10.1094/PDIS-04-23-0754-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
