Our previous studies found that the anticomplement polysaccharides from some medicinal plants could significantly alleviate H1N1-induced acute lung injury (H1N1-ALI). The leaves and twigs of Tamarix chinensis Lour. are traditionally used as a Chinese medicine Xiheliu for treating inflammatory disorders. Interestingly, its crude polysaccharides (MBAP90) showed potent anticomplement activity in vitro.", "To evaluate the therapeutic effects and possible mechanism of MBAP90 on viral pneumonia and further isolate and characterize the key active substance of MBAP90.", "The protective effects of MBAP90 were evaluated by survival tests and pharmacodynamic experiments on H1N1-ALI mice. Histopathological changes, viral load, inflammatory markers, and complement deposition in lungs were analyzed by H&E staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. An anticomplement homogenous polysaccharide (MBAP-3) was obtained from MBAP90 by bio-guided separation, and its structure was further characterized by methylation analysis and NMR spectroscopy.", "Oral administration of MBAP90 at a dose of 400\u00a0mg/kg significantly increased the survival rate of mice infected with the lethal H1N1 virus. In H1N1-induced ALI, mice treated with MBAP90 (200 and 400\u00a0mg/kg) could decrease the lung index, lung pathological injury, the levels of excessive proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, IL-18, and IL-1\u03b2), and complement levels (C3c and C5b-9). In addition, MBAP-3 was characterized as a novel homogenous polysaccharide with potent in vitro anticomplement activity (CH<sub>50</sub>: 0.126\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.002\u00a0mg/mL), containing 10.51% uronic acids and 9.67% flavonoids, which were similar to the composition of MBAP90. The backbone of MBAP-3 consisted of \u21924)-\u03b1-D-Glcp-(1\u2192, \u21923,4,6)-\u03b1-D-Glcp-(1\u2192, and \u21923,4)-\u03b1-D-Glcp-(1\u2192, with branches comprising \u03b1-L-Araf-(1\u2192, \u03b1-D-GlcpA-(1\u2192, \u21924,6)-\u03b1-D-Manp-(1\u2192 and \u21924)-\u03b2-D-Galp-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0. Particularly, O-6 of \u21924)-\u03b2-D-Galp-(1\u2192 was conjugated with a flavonoid, myricetin.", "MBAP90 could ameliorate H1N1-ALI by inhibiting inflammation and over-activation of the complement system. These polysaccharides (MBAP90 and MBAP-3) with relative high contents of uronic acid and flavonoid substituent might be vital components of T. chinensis for treating viral pneumonia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
