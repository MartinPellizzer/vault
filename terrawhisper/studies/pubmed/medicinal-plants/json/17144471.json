And then, all the male rats were copulated with adult female rats. The rates of pregnancy, average numbers of embryos and luteum of female rats, relative weights of reproductive organs, sperm counts, sperm motility and viability were compared among all the groups. The histology and ultrastructure of testis and epididymis were observed, while the concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and testostorone (T) in serum and T in testicular homogenate were detected by radioimmunoassay.", "Compared with those in GTW model group, the embryo numbers, the relative weight of testis and epididymis and sperm counts and motility in C. cuneata groups were increased obviously (P < 0.05). After treatment, the morphological damages of seminiferous tubules and sperms were recovered, while concentrations of T in testicular homogenate were also significantly increased (P < 0.01).", "C. cuneata could relieve the reproductive lesions induced by GTW, and hence improve the uberty of the male infertile model rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Reproductive Medicine, Family Planning Research Institute, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Lian", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Hui-Min", "Initials": "HM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Jin-Wen", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Yong-Hong", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ming", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Fen", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Cheng-Liang", "Initials": "CL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3XMK78S47O", "NameOfSubstance": "Testosterone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Crataegus"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Infertility, Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sperm Motility"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Testis"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Testosterone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tripterygium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17144471"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
