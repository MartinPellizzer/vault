Similar to other symptomatic therapies, treatment of Zheng with an Oriental drug results in improvement of psychosomatic disease. Thus, patients differ between Chaikojialonglotsuboleitang and Guizhifulingwan. Principle indications are neither sleeplessness nor irritation, but pressure pain and resistance in the right upper abdomen in the former drug and pressure pain and resistance in the left lower abdomen in the latter. Treatment with the drug according to this procedure consequently results in recovery from the disease. This is the reason why we call it a radical therapy, not a symptomatic one. As the Oriental drug produces extremely favorable effects in psychosomatic disease and often cures it radically, we believe that this therapy should be applied as a first choice among the drug therapies available."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shigeru", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Am J Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7901431", "ISSNLinking": "0192-415X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Psychophysiologic Disorders"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7053026", "10.1142/s0192415x81000378", "S0192415X81000378"]}}]}
