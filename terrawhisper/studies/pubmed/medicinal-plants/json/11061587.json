After subcutaneous injection, there is a local inflammatory reaction at the injection site and systemic elevation of activated lymphocytes. The immunomodulatory effect of VaQuFrF in the first 24 h after subcutaneous injection on blood leukocyte and lymphocyte subpopulation was investigated. Because a significant natural circadian variation of these cellular parameters exist, the influence was studied in regard to this. In two groups of healthy volunteers, one group receiving VaQuFrF, the following parameters were measured every 2-3 h over a period of 24 h: leukocytes, band form, segmented and eosinophilic granulocytes, monocytes, total lymphocytes and CD4-, CD8-, CD3/25- and CD8/38-positive lymphocytes in count and percentage. In regard to the natural circadian variation 24 h after injection of VaQuFrF, a statistically significant fall in the absolute numbers and percentage of CD3/ 25- and CD8/38-positive lymphocytes was observed. Also, monocytes in percent and absolute numbers show a transient fall 6-9 h, lymphocytes only in absolute and CD4-positive lymphocytes only in percentage 2 h after injection. The results demonstrate that there is increased extravasation of (activated) lymphocytes and monocytes after subcutaneous injection of 1 mg VaQuFrF."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "European Institute for Oncological and Immunological Research, Berlin, Germany. robert.gorter@eifoi.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stoss", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peter", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gorter", "ForeName": "R W", "Initials": "RW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Nat Immun", "NlmUniqueID": "9206126", "ISSNLinking": "1018-8916"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Circadian Rhythm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Immunity, Innate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Subcutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Subsets"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11061587", "10.1159/000069445", "69445"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
