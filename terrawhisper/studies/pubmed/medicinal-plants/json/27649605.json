All the samples were collected from 6 regions of Yuxi in Yunnan Province in the southwest of China and were digested with concentrated nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide in a microwave system. The recovery rates of standard addition ranged from 98.24% to 111.8%; the correlation coefficients were all above 0.999. The amounts of As (0.009-0.41 \u03bcg \u00b7 g-1 dry weight [dw]), Cd (0-0.266 \u03bcg \u00b7 g-1 dw), and Pb (0-2.6 \u03bcg \u00b7 g-1 dw) were below the permissible limits in food that are promulgated by the World Health Organization. All the element concentrations determined in this study were proved at the common level. The result of principal component analysis indicated that 5 principal components were extracted from 11 elements, which revealed 74.7% of all variable information. The results of cluster analysis mainly showed the presence of 3 metal groups."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming, China; Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yanli", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuanzhong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming, China; Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wanyi", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Med Mushrooms", "NlmUniqueID": "100886202", "ISSNLinking": "1940-4344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Agaricales"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruiting Bodies, Fungal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27649605", "10.1615/intjmedmushrooms.v18.i5.70", "0cbef6a12a779453,55f718946b5171a7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
