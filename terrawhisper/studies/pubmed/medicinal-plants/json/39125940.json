The frequent occurrence of chimeric mitochondrial genes leading to CMS is consistent with the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) evolution. The sequence conservation resulting from faithfully maternal inheritance and the chimeric structure caused by frequent sequence recombination have been defined as two major features of the mitogenome. However, when and how these chimeric mitochondrial genes appear in the context of the highly conserved reproduction of mitochondria is an enigma. This review, therefore, presents the critical view of the research on CMS in plants to elucidate the mechanisms of this phenomenon. Generally, distant hybridization is the main mechanism to generate an original CMS source in natural populations and in breeding. Mitochondria and mitogenomes show pleomorphic and dynamic changes at key stages of the life cycle. The promitochondria in dry seeds develop into fully functioning mitochondria during seed imbibition, followed by massive mitochondria or mitogenome fusion and fission in the germination stage along with changes in the mtDNA structure and quantity. The mitogenome stability is controlled by nuclear loci, such as the nuclear gene <i>Msh1</i>. Its suppression leads to the rearrangement of mtDNA and the production of heritable CMS genes. An abundant recombination of mtDNA is also often found in distant hybrids and somatic/cybrid hybrids. Since mtDNA recombination is ubiquitous in distant hybridization, we put forward a hypothesis that the original CMS genes originated from mtDNA recombination during the germination of the hybrid seeds produced from distant hybridizations to solve the nucleo-cytoplasmic incompatibility resulting from the allogenic nuclear genome during seed germination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6179-0048"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, The Key Laboratory of Medicinal Plant Biology of Yunnan Province, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xuemei", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Zhengpin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China."}], "LastName": "Lou", "ForeName": "Hongbo", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8774-7470"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Cunqiang", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4362-6578"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, The Key Laboratory of Medicinal Plant Biology of Yunnan Province, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Shengchao", "Initials": "S"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "No. 31200908 and No. 8176140709", "Agency": "the National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Systematic Review", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int J Mol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101092791", "ISSNLinking": "1422-0067"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Mitochondrial"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Mitochondrial"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Mitochondrial"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Infertility"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Mitochondrial"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "16"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39125940", "10.3390/ijms25158372", "ijms25158372"]}}]}
