Children with goiter and age- and sex-adjusted controls were involved in the current study. Hair trace elements content was assessed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Thyroid volume was measured using an ultrasound scanner and compared to the previously calculated normal values. The obtained data indicate that children with goiter were characterized by 20 and 15\u00a0% lower values of hair Cr and Zn, and 66, 42, 16, and 42\u00a0% higher hair levels of I, Mn, Si, and V as compared to the control values, respectively. Moreover, children with goiter were characterized by a twofold higher hair B levels than the control ones. Correlation analysis demonstrated a significant direct association only between thyroid volume and hair B (r\u00a0=\u00a00.482; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), I (r\u00a0=\u00a00.393; p\u00a0=\u00a00.021), Mn (r\u00a0=\u00a00.364; p\u00a0=\u00a00.034), and Si (r\u00a0=\u00a00.446; p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) levels. It is also notable that hair I content was interrelated only with Si (r\u00a0=\u00a00.346; p\u00a0=\u00a00.045). No significant correlation was detected between I and B (r\u00a0=\u00a00.250; p\u00a0=\u00a00.155) and Mn (r\u00a0=\u00a00.076; p\u00a0=\u00a00.669) in hair of children. It is hypothesized that an increase in thyroid volume in children is associated with a complex interplay of iodine with other trace elements rather than with altered iodine status itself."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "West Kazakhstan Marat Ospanov State Medical University, Aktobe, Kazakhstan."}], "LastName": "Kudabayeva", "ForeName": "Khatima I", "Initials": "KI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "West Kazakhstan Marat Ospanov State Medical University, Aktobe, Kazakhstan."}], "LastName": "Koshmaganbetova", "ForeName": "Gulbakit K", "Initials": "GK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Kaunas, Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Mickuviene", "ForeName": "Narseta", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Russian Society of Trace Elements in Medicine, Moscow, Russia."}], "LastName": "Skalnaya", "ForeName": "Margarita G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orenburg State Medical University, Orenburg, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "All-Russian Research Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (VILAR), Moscow, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orenburg State University, Orenburg, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yaroslavl State University, Yaroslavl, Russia."}], "LastName": "Tinkov", "ForeName": "Alexey A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Russian Society of Trace Elements in Medicine, Moscow, Russia. skalny3@microelements.ru."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "All-Russian Research Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (VILAR), Moscow, Russia. skalny3@microelements.ru."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orenburg State University, Orenburg, Russia. skalny3@microelements.ru."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yaroslavl State University, Yaroslavl, Russia. skalny3@microelements.ru."}], "LastName": "Skalny", "ForeName": "Anatoly V", "Initials": "AV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biol Trace Elem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7911509", "ISSNLinking": "0163-4984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Goiter"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hair"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Thyroid Gland"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27106540", "10.1007/s12011-016-0711-6", "10.1007/s12011-016-0711-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
