And these properties of flavonoids might contribute to their anti-inflammatory activity in vivo. In this study, several polyhydroxylated/methoxylated flavonoid derivatives such as oroxylin A, wogonin, skullcapflavone II, tectorigenin and iristectorigenin A were isolated from the medicinal plants. These compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase from the homogenate of human platelets in vitro. It was found that isoflavones including daidzein and tectorigenin possessed the inhibitory activity on cyclooxygenase, although the potency of inhibition was far less than that of indomethacin. In addition, oroxylin A, baicalein and wogonin inhibited 12-lipoxygenase activity without affecting cyclooxygenase, which suggested that 5,6,7- or 5,7,8-trisubstitutions of A-ring of flavone gave favorable results. The IC50 values of oroxylin A and NDGA against 12-lipoxygenase were found to be 100 and 1.5 microM, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Kangwon National University, Chunchon, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "You", "ForeName": "K M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jong", "ForeName": "H G", "Initials": "HG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "H P", "Initials": "HP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Arch Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8000036", "ISSNLinking": "0253-6269"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Autoradiography"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Platelets"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10071954", "10.1007/BF02976430"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
