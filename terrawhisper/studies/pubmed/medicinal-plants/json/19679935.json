(Ranunculaceae), is considered one of the most poisonous plants growing in Europe. Monkshood and other Aconitum species are still used in Oriental and homeopathic medicine as analgesics, febrifuges and hypotensives. The neurotoxin aconitine is the principal alkaloid in most subspecies of monkshood. A review is presented, which includes historical aspects of monkshood as a poisonous and medicinal plant, the mode of action of aconitine, symptoms of toxicity, treatment and reports of recent poisoning incidents. In addition, results of quantitative HPLC examination of hypogeous and epigeous organs from a population of A. napellus ssp. vulgare cultivated in Iceland are discussed. The fact that children in Iceland have commonly been known to eat the sweet tasting nectaries in monkshood prompted an investigation of the alkaloidal content of these organs specifically. The low aconitine content found in the nectaries as well as in whole flowers accords with the absence of reported toxicity arising from the handling of flowers and consumption of nectaries from A. napellus in this country."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ingolfsdottir", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Olafsson", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iceland", "MedlineTA": "Laeknabladid", "NlmUniqueID": "7901326", "ISSNLinking": "0023-7213"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19679935"]}}]}
