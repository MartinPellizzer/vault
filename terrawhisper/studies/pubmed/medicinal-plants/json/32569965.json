In this study, a <sup>1</sup>H qNMR method was developed for the analysis of propenylbenzenes (eugenol and seven analogues) in the essential oils, a broadly distributed class of natural flavours. It was validated in terms of specificity (methoxy/acetate signal), linearity (range 0.05-5.00\u00a0mg per assay), sensitivity (limit of detection and quantification 4.4 and 14.9\u00a0\u00b5g/mL respectively), accuracy and precision. The qNMR technique was utilized during the sensory or activity-guided identification of chavibetol as the key odorant and antioxidant in the betel (Piper betle L., Bangla cultivar) oil, a widely consumed chewing stimulant and valuable flavouring agent. The method was also applied for the evaluation of six different post-harvest drying techniques for betel leaves through the quantitative analysis of unambiguously identified propenylbenzene markers (chavibetol, chavibetol acetate and 4-allyl-1,2-phenylene diacetate)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
