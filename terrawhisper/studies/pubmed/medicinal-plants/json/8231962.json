MYMV DNA 1 and DNA 2 consists of 2,723 and 2,675 nucleotides respectively. DNA 1 and DNA 2 have little sequence similarity except for a region of approximately 200 bases which is almost identical in the two molecules. Analysis of open reading frames revealed nine potential coding regions for proteins of mol. wt. > 10,000, six in DNA 1 and three in DNA 2. The nucleotide sequence of MYMV DNA was compared with that of bean golden mosaic virus (BGMV), tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) and African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV). The 200-base region common to the two DNAs of each virus had little sequence similarity, except for a highly conserved 33-36 base sequence potentially capable of forming a stable hairpin structure. The potential coding regions in the MYMV DNAs had counterparts in the BGMV, TGMV and ACMV, suggesting an overall similarity in genome organization, except for absence of 1L3 in MYMV DNA 1. The most highly conserved ORFs, MYMV 1R1, BGMV 1R1, TGMV 1R1 and ACMV 1R1, are the putative genes for the coat proteins of MYMV, BGMV, TGMV and ACMV, respectively. MYMV 1L1 has also a high degree of sequence similarity with BGMV 1L1, TGMV 1L1 and ACMV 1L1."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Laboratory, Teijin Tokyo Research Center, Japan."}], "LastName": "Morinaga", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ikegami", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miura", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["D14703", "D14704"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Microbiol Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "7703966", "ISSNLinking": "0385-5600"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Single-Stranded"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Viral"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Single-Stranded"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Open Reading Frames"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8231962", "10.1111/j.1348-0421.1993.tb03238.x"]}}]}
