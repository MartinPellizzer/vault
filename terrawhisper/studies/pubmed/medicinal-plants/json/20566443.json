The antiulcer efficacy of the aqueous extract of leaves of Pedalium murex on ethanol induced gastric lesions was investigated in our studies. This has been substantiated by ascertaining the content of total acid, acid volume, total protein, ulcer index and glutathione. Ulceration was induced in 36 hours fasted rats by the administration of 80% ethanol (1 ml/kg) orally. The reference standard (famotidine, 3 mg/kg) and aqueous extract of leaves of Pedalium murex in doses of 50, 100, 200 mg/kg was given to different groups, one hour before the administration of ethanol. Marked gastric mucosal lesions were observed with ethanol. A perceptible elevation in ulcer index, total acidity, acid volume, total protein and diminution of glutathione was observed. Pretreatment with aqueous extract of leaves of Pedalium murex particularly at a dose of 200 mg/kg in a single schedule and 100 mg/kg for 15 and 30 days treatment annihilated these alterations and elevated the level of glutathione. Therefore the aqueous extract of leaves of Pedalium murex could be regarded as a favorable antiulcerogen which could be attributed to its content of flavonoids and mucilage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Nalanda College of Pharmacy, Cherlapally, Nalgonda-508001, Andhra Pradesh, India. davidbanji@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Banji", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Jaideep", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Banji", "ForeName": "Otilia Jf", "Initials": "OJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M", "ForeName": "Shanthamurthy", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20566443"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
