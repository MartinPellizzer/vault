The tested substances were extracted repeatedly with acetone. The revertants induced by 2-AF AFTB1 (with TA98, TA100). MNNG (with TA100) were significantly decreased when the six natural foods were added to the medium. The results revealed that all six natural foods showed remarkable inhibitory effect on 2-AF, AFTB1, MNNG induced mutagenic activity for strains TA98 and TA100 and suggested the presence of anti-mutagenic substances in the six natural foods. This experiment provides a scientific basis to the study of food substances for the prevention of carcinogenesis. It is considered that the six natural foods possess remarkable anti-mutagenic effect and is practically valuable in the field of chemoprophylaxis of Cancer in men."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ruan", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "7904962", "ISSNLinking": "0253-9624"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nuts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Suppression, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2582925"]}}]}
