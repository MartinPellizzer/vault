Then, further related mechanisms responsible for anti-proliferation were investigated by cell death detection ELISA and Flow cytometry.", "The results showed that treated cells became rounded up and there was a loss of contact with neighboring cells, leading to a reduction of cell viability. The cytotoxic effects were evaluated IC50 for HCT116 and HT29 cells were 2.16 mg/mL and 1.29 mg/mL, respectively but it not toxic to normal HEK293 at the same dose. Moreover, Gac aril extract significantly inhibits proliferative ability with increasing concentrations having a greater effect. Subsequently, the cellular mechanism responsible for suppressive proliferation was validated. It shows apoptosis induction and arrest of cell cycle.", "Our findings demonstrated that Gac aril extract can induce apoptosis and arrest of cell cycle at S and G2/M phases in both HCT116 and HT29 colorectal cancer cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Phayao, Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Excellence of Pharmacological Research on Medicinal Plants, University of Phayao, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Praphasawat", "ForeName": "Ratsada", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8558-9787"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Excellence of Pharmacological Research on Medicinal Plants, University of Phayao, Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacology, Department of Pharmaceutical Care, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Phayao, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Singsai", "ForeName": "Kanathip", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Care, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Phayao, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Muenkaew", "ForeName": "Phuridee", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Care, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Phayao, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Sirisawat", "ForeName": "Sarita", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Care, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Phayao, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Jaewcharoenchai", "ForeName": "Watanyu", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Medical Science, University of Phayao, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Thakaew", "ForeName": "Sinitra", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Medical Science, University of Phayao, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Komkhan", "ForeName": "Supatthra", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Medical Science, University of Phayao, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Rawangkarn", "ForeName": "Anchalee", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Thailand", "MedlineTA": "Asian Pac J Cancer Prev", "NlmUniqueID": "101130625", "ISSNLinking": "1513-7368"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Colorectal Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Momordica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HCT116 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HT29 Cells"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38809629", "10.31557/APJCP.2024.25.5.1579", "91130"]}}]}
