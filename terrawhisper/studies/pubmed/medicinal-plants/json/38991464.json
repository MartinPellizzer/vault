Many of them have been identified as pharmacologically active compounds from various medicinal plants, in which prenyl residues play a key role in these activities. Prenyltransferases (PTs) responsible for their biosynthesis have been intensively studied in the last two decades. These enzymes are membrane-bound proteins belonging to the UbiA superfamily that occurs from bacteria to humans, and in particular those involved in plant specialized metabolism show strict specificities for both substrates and products. This article reviews the enzymatic features of plant UbiA PTs, including C- and O-prenylation, molecular evolution, and application of UbiA PTs in synthetic biology."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
