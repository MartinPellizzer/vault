The isolated compounds were characterised using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The anti-quorum sensing potential of S. nigrescens crude extracts and selected phytochemicals was quantified using Chromobacterium violaceum quorum sensing-controlled violacein inhibition assays. Qualitative modulation of quorum sensing activity and signal synthesis was investigated using agar diffusion double ring assays and C. violaceum. Molecular docking was conducted to explore the binding conformations of ent-kaurene diterpenes and flavonoids into the binding sites of quorum sensing regulator proteins, CviR and CviR'.", "Phytochemical investigation of S. nigrescens resulted in the isolation of a new ent-kaurene diterpenoid (ent-kaur-15-en-18,20-diol) alongside ent-kaur-15-en-18-ol, being isolated for the first time from a plant species. Other compounds isolated included 30-hydroxylup-20(29)-en-3\u03b2-ol, 3\u03b2-hydroxy-20(29)-en-lupan-30-al, lupeol, stigmasterol, a long chain alcohol (tetracosan-1-ol) and three flavonoids (melanoxetin, quercetin and quercetin-3-O-methyl ether). Structures of isolated compounds were elucidated using different spectroscopic techniques including 1D and 2D NMR. Inhibition of violacein production was concentration-dependent, with 56.52% inhibition being obtained with 200\u202f\u00b5g of quercetin-3-O-methyl ether, while 53.38% inhibition was obtained with 600\u202f\u00b5g of quercetin. Agar diffusion double ring assays indicated CviI synthase/CviR receptor modulation by S. nigrescens phytochemicals, suggesting that quorum signal synthesis was down-regulated and/or targeting binding of signal to the receptor. The computed binding energy data suggested that the flavonoids had a stronger tendency to inhibit both CviR and CviR' with varying binding affinities.", "S. nigrescens crude extracts together with the novel ent-kaurenoids and flavonoids demonstrated potential anti-quorum sensing activity. S. nigrescens may thus represent a source of anti-quorum sensing therapeutic candidates for the control of existing and emerging infectious diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
