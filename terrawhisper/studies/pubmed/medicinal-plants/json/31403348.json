The effects of e-beam irradiation on the microbial load, stability of the active components, and anti-inflammatory activity of medicinal herbs were determined. We observed that the total aerobic bacteria (TAB; 4.0-7.0 log CFU/g), yeasts and molds (Y&M; 3.3-6.8 log CFU/g), and coliform counts (CC; 3.2-3.8 log CFU/g) in both herb samples were effectively reduced in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in acceptable levels of <3.0 log CFU/g in TAB and Y&M and negative in CC at 10 kGy irradiation. The concentration of the active components (0.87-4.22\u2009mg/g) of Cnidii Rhizoma, including z-ligustilide, chlorogenic acid, senkyunolide A, and ferulic acid, in order of prevalence and those (0.86-2.76\u2009mg/g) of Alismatis Rhizoma, including Alisol B acetate and Alisol B, were not changed at irradiation doses of \u226410 kGy. The extracts of e-beam irradiated Cnidii Rhizoma and Alismatis Rhizoma showed a reduced production of inflammation-related factors, such as nitric oxide, prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-6, in a concentration-dependent manner, which was induced by lipopolysaccharide in RAW 264.7 cell. However, there was no significant difference observed at e-beam irradiation doses of 0, 1, 5, and 10 kGy. Thus, we confirm that e-beam irradiation up to 10 kGy was effective for the control of microbial load in Cnidii Rhizoma and Alismatis Rhizoma without causing considerable changes in their major active components and anti-inflammatory activity. The results show the potential of e-beam application for sanitization of medicinal herbs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Quality Certification Center, National Development Institute of Korean Medicine, Daegu, Korea."}], "LastName": "Baek", "ForeName": "Mi-Eun", "Initials": "ME"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea."}], "LastName": "Jo", "ForeName": "Yunhee", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea."}], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Namhyeok", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Minji", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Quality Certification Center, National Development Institute of Korean Medicine, Daegu, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jung-Ok", "Initials": "JO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Quality Certification Center, National Development Institute of Korean Medicine, Daegu, Korea."}], "LastName": "Won", "ForeName": "Jaehee", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Sang-Han", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kwon", "ForeName": "Joong-Ho", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K7Q1JQR04M", "NameOfSubstance": "Dinoprostone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Alisma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Load"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dinoprostone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrons"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RAW 264.7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31403348", "10.1089/jmf.2019.4429"]}}]}
