An altered gene expression in cancer leads to a change in the overall activity of the human cell. Overexpression of cancer protein may give a piece of wide information about the specific type of tumor. Sphingosine kinase-1 (SK-1) is a metabolic enzyme that is mainly overexpressed in several types of cancer and other inflammatory diseases. Similarly, pyruvate kinase-M2 (PK-M2) is an important oncogenic ATP-producing glycolytic enzyme that is upregulated in most cancer cells. The phytocompound of medicinal plants such as <i>Nigella sativa</i> contains a variety of micronutrients that inhibit the proliferation and activity of tumor cells. In this study, the role of phytocompounds in combating cancer was studied against the model kinase proteins, that is, PK-M2 and SK-1. <i>In silico</i> tool like the PASS-Way2Drug server was used to predict the anticancer properties of phytocompounds. Moreover, the CLC-Pred web server provided the cytotoxicity prediction of chemical compounds against several human cancer cell lines. The pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles were predicted by the SwissADME and pkCSM software. The binding energies were obtained by molecular docking to confirm the intermolecular interaction of selected phytocompounds with proteins. Consequently, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation confirmed the stability, conformational changes, and dynamic behavior of the kinase proteins complexed with the lead phytocompounds, that is, epicatechin, apigenin, and kaempferol.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
