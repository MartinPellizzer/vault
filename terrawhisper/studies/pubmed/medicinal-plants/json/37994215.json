The aim of this work is to determine the chemical composition of different extracts (extracts obtained by using supercritical carbon dioxide extraction, accelerated solvent extraction, homogenizer-assisted extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, and ultrasound-assisted extraction from Hippomarathrum scabrum L., and evaluate their biological properties. The analysis revealed that 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, rutin, and isorhamnetin 3-O-rutinoside were the main bioactive compounds. The extract obtained by accelerated extraction contains the highest concentration of 5-O-Caffeoylquinic acid (7616.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a063.09\u00a0mg/kg dry extract) followed by the extract obtained by homogenizer-assisted extraction (6682.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.04\u00a0mg/kg dry extract). In antioxidant tests, all extracts expressed significant antioxidant activity. Also, cytotoxic and anticancer effects of these plant extracts were detected in the human prostate cancer cell line. Intrinsic apoptotic genes were up-regulated and anti-apoptotic genes were down-regulated in human prostate cancer cells after inhibition concentration dose treatment. The findings are promising, and suggest the use of these plant extracts could be used as natural sources with different biological activities, as well as anticancer agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Science Faculty, Selcuk University, Konya, Turkey."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Botanic Garden \"Giardino dei Semplici\", Universit\u00e0 degli Studi \"Gabriele d'Annunzio\", Chieti, Italy."}], "LastName": "Nilofar"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, KTO Karatay University, Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Duran", "ForeName": "Tugce", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Istanbul AREL University, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Uba", "ForeName": "Abdullahi Ibrahim", "Initials": "AI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Technology, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Cvetanovi\u0107 Kljaki\u0107", "ForeName": "Aleksandra", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Physiology, Institute for Biological Research \"Sini\u0161a Stankovi\u0107\", National Institute of Republic of Serbia, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Bo\u017eunovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Jelena", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Physiology, Institute for Biological Research \"Sini\u0161a Stankovi\u0107\", National Institute of Republic of Serbia, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Ga\u0161i\u0107", "ForeName": "Uro\u0161", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Human Pathologies, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Rabat, Morroco."}], "LastName": "Bouyahya", "ForeName": "Abdelhakim", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Science Faculty, Selcuk University, Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Y\u0131ldiztugay", "ForeName": "Evren", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Botanic Garden \"Giardino dei Semplici\", Universit\u00e0 degli Studi \"Gabriele d'Annunzio\", Chieti, Italy."}], "LastName": "Ferrante", "ForeName": "Claudio", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6548-7823"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Science Faculty, Selcuk University, Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Zengin", "ForeName": "Gokhan", "Initials": "G"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "7750168", "Agency": "Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "451-03-47/2023-01/200134", "Agency": "Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "51-03-47/2023-01/200007", "Agency": "Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Sep Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101088554", "ISSNLinking": "1615-9306"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O4601UER1Z", "NameOfSubstance": "5'-O-caffeoylquinic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "318ADP12RI", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorogenic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "058C04BGYI", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prostatic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorogenic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Quinic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Tvrd\u00e1 E, Benko F.
