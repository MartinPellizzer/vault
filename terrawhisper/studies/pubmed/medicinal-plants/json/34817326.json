Therefore, inhibition of microglia activity is a chief strategy in reducing neurotoxic damage to the central nervous system. In this study, an herbal Immunomodulatory Drug (IMOD) was used to evaluate the effects of this drug in controlling the amount of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide induction was performed by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rat inflamed microglial cell line, CHME-5. ELISA test was used to measure the produced nitric oxide at 24, 48, and 72 hours. The results showed that the high concentrations of IMOD (1.2, and 4% V/V) had anti-inflammatory effects on microglial cells and were able to reduce the amount of nitric oxide in these cells but the effective dose of IMOD was in the range of 1.2% V/V. Therefore, the safest dose and the best time for the effect of IMOD on inflammatory cell groups are 1.2% V/V and 72h, respectively. Hence, with further studies, IMOD can be considered as an herbal anti-inflammatory drug that is effective in controlling neurodegenerative diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of surgery of traditional Chinese medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, 410007, China. fhq530286@126.com."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yu-Wei", "Initials": "YW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of surgery of traditional Chinese medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, 410007, China. fhq530286@126.com."}], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Jun-Yao", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, The Third People's Hospital of Yingkou City, Yingkou, 115000, China. fhq530286@126.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Gang", "Initials": "XG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Breast, The First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, 410007, China. fhq530286@126.com."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Hong-Qiao", "Initials": "HQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunomodulating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunomodulating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microglia"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "17"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34817326", "10.14715/cmb/2021.67.2.21"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
