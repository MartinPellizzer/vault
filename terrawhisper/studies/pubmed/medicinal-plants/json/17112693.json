Four intervention groups were defined: two extract doses (3 and 6 mg/day); ibuprofen (1200 mg/day); placebo (3mg/day). Participants were followed-up individually for 4 months. The main outcome variable was abdominal pain intensity measured according to a visual analogue scale (VAS).", "The average age of participants was 19 years; menarche occurred around age 12 years. Participants had menstrual cycles of 28 or 29 days, with menstruation lasting 5 days and mean of pain intensity of 8.2 on the VAS. During each successive treatment cycle, participants experienced a lower pain intensity score. Multiple regression analysis, after adjusting each cycle for baseline pain, treatment compliance and other variables, showed that the group receiving 6 mg/day extract had significantly reduced pain intensity (p<0.001). This effect was maintained in cycles 2 and 3, although the reduction in the mean of pain intensity was lower. The group receiving the 3mg/day extract did not show a consistent effect throughout the three cycles.", "At a dose of 6 mg/day, the standardized phyto-drug (Psidii guajavae folium extract) reduced menstrual pain significantly compared with conventional treatment and placebo."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Epidemiology and Health Services Research Unit \"Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI\", Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS), Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Doubova", "ForeName": "Svetlana Vladislavovna", "Initials": "SV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morales", "ForeName": "Hortensia Reyes", "Initials": "HR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hern\u00e1ndez", "ForeName": "Sergio Flores", "Initials": "SF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "del Carmen Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Coss\u00edo Ortiz", "ForeName": "Marcela Gonz\u00e1lez", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soto", "ForeName": "Marco A Ch\u00e1vez", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arce", "ForeName": "Erika Rivera", "Initials": "ER"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lozoya", "ForeName": "Xavier", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WK2XYI10QM", "NameOfSubstance": "Ibuprofen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dysmenorrhea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ibuprofen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Myrtaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17112693", "10.1016/j.jep.2006.09.033", "S0378-8741(06)00509-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
