The flavonoids, soluble polysaccharides, cellulose, nucleosides and amino acids in the different tissues of A. manihot were determined by HPLC coupled with UV-Vis spectrophotpmetry, and UPLC-TQ/MS. The flowers are rich in the resourceful chemical compositions of flavonoids which mainly consist of hyperoside, isoquercitrin, cotton-8-O-glucuronide, myricetin, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, rutin and quercetin. The total content of these flavonoids is 25.450 mg\u2022g-1 in the flowers, while they are trace in the other tissues.Different tissues of A. manihot are rich in soluble polysaccharides and celluloses and the stems have the highest content(19.76%) of soluble polysaccharides, while the roots have the highest content (29.88%) of cellulose. Total of 21 amino acids and 9 nucleosides were detected in this plant, and the flowers have the highest content of amino acids(4.737 mg\u2022g\u207b\u00b9), while the leaves have the highest content of nucleosides (1.474 mg\u2022g\u207b\u00b9). A. manihot is rich in the resourceful chemical compositions, and its constituents and contents are various in different tissues of this plant.The results provided a scientific basis for the utilization and industrial development of A. manihot plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
