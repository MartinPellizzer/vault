The culture was cultivated on a Murashige-Skoog medium with an addition of 10 mg.l-1 of alpha-naphthylacetic acid. A positive effect on the production was caused mainly by the elicitation of the suspension culture. The maximal content of anthracene derivatives (1.346%), found by photometric determination according to PhBs 4, was demonstrated after 6-hour action of the homogenate of Candida utilis of a concentration of 0.143 mg/30 ml of the medium in an eight-year old culture derived from the root of the intact plant Rheum palmatum. A one-year-old culture derived from the root of the intact and germinating plant reacted to elicitation more sensitively as there was an increase in production up to 228% in comparison with the control. However, the content of anthracene derivatives was lower than in the eight-year-old culture. In contrast to the suspension culture, the production of anthracene derivatives in the callus culture was influenced by elicitation only in the minimal extent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Katedra farmakognozie Farmaceutick\u00e9 fakulty Univerzity Karlovy, Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kasparov\u00e1", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Siatka", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Vliv biotick\u00e9ho elicitoru Candida utilis na produkci anthracenov\u00fdch deriv\u00e1t\u016f tk\u00e1novou kulturou Rheum palmatum L."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Czech Republic", "MedlineTA": "Ceska Slov Farm", "NlmUniqueID": "9433765", "ISSNLinking": "1210-7816"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthracenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Anthracenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Candida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rheum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11242835"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
