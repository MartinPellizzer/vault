Among these, an unreported antigen (hapten 6-KLH) was selected as the optimal immunogen and coating antigen. In addition, an imidacloprid-specific and high titer monoclonal antibody (IMIB7C3) was obtained by using the above-selected immunogen. A sensitive ic-ELISA (indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 1.3\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> was established by using the IMIB7C3 antibody (only 1.2\u00a0ng per well) to detect the residues of imidacloprid in grains (wheat and maize) and different herbs (Notoginseng radix et rhizoma, Dioscoreae rhizoma, Lonicerae japonicae flos, Astragali radix, Jujubae fructus). The detection results of real samples by the developed immunoassay were confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), which proved the accuracy and reliability of the established ic-ELISA. These results indicate that the proposed ic-ELISA method is suitable for rapid and high-throughput detection of imidacloprid residues in agricultural products and medicinal herbs. Furthermore, a quantitative risk assessment was conducted for Lonicerae japonicae flos based on the detection results, which indicates an acceptable risk to human health after the intake of Lonicerae japonicae flos polluted by imidacloprid."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
