Plant volatiles play an important role in host-searching of insects. The olfactory responses of S.\u00a0paniceum to the most abundant volatile components of some drugstore attractant CMPMs such as Panax notoginseng, Angelica sinensis, Gastrodia elata and Peucedanum praeruptorum, namely falcarinol, 3-n-butylphthalide, p-cresol and \u03b2-pinene, respectively, were studied by electroantennography (EAG) and behavioural bioassays in six- and four-arm olfactometers.", "EAG recordings showed that male and female antennae are able to perceive the test compounds in a wide range of concentrations and in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, for each dose of different compounds tested, no significant differences were found between the mean male and female EAG responses. In six-arm olfactometer bioassays, S.\u00a0paniceum exhibited positive responses to falcarinol, 3-n-butylphthalide, p-cresol and \u03b2-pinene at doses of 1, 10, 100, 500 and 1000\u2009\u03bcg. The most attractive dose was 500\u2009\u03bcg for falcarinol, 100\u2009\u03bcg for 3-n-butylphthalide, 500\u2009\u03bcg for p-cresol and 1000\u2009\u03bcg for \u03b2-pinene. Olfactory preferences of S.\u00a0paniceum, based on comparison of these four compounds at their optimally attractive concentrations in a four-arm olfactometer, were 3-n-butylphthalide > p-cresol > falcarinol > \u03b2-pinene.", "The results indicated that the four volatiles of CMPMs are perceived by the peripheral olfactory system of S.\u00a0paniceum adults and are able to individually elicit a positive chemotaxis in S.\u00a0paniceum adults confirming the role of chemical cues in host-plant detection and selection of this pest. Further field studies are needed to evaluate the potential of the attractive compounds identified in this study, particularly 3-n-butylphthalide, to be applied as a novel monitoring and control tool against this storage-beetle pest. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
