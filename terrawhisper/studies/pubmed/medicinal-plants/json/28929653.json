Infection rata of GV reached plateau of 90% at the 90th d of inoculation; fresh weight of overground part and leaf number were significantly higher in GV group, with 2.7 and 1.96 fold than that of control; contents of all endogenous hormones apart from ABA in over- and under-ground part were markedly lower (P<0.05) in GV group at the 75th and 90th d, respectively, with 63% to 75% and 45% to 81% of that in control, and were significantly higher (P<0.05) in both over- and under-ground part in GV group at the 105th d, with 1.4 to 1.7 fold higher than that of control; content of ABA in underground part increased significantly at 60th, 75th and 105th d.
