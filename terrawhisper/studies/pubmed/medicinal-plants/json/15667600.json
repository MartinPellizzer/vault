Elevated tissue levels of cellular superoxide anion/oxidative stress are a mechanism by which doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Selected medicinal plant extracts were tested for their antioxidant capacity and cardioprotective effect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. The cardiac myoblasts H9c2 were incubated with the antioxidants ascorbic acid, trolox, N-acetylcysteine or selected medicinal plant extracts including; 1) ethanolic extracts from Curcuma longa L-EtOH Phyllanthus emblica L-EtOH, and Piper rostratum Roxb-EtOH; and 2) water extracts from Curcuma longa L-H2O and Morus alba L-H2O. The cardioprotective effects of these extracts were evaluated by crystal violet cytotoxicity assay. IC50s of doxorubicin were compared in the presence or absence of ascorbic acids, trolox, N-acetylcysteine or plant extracts. Morus alba L-H2O showed the highest antioxidant properties evaluated by ferric reducing/antioxidant power assay. Ascorbic acid and N-acetylcysteine had modest effects on the protection of doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity while trolox showed insignificant protective effect. All plant extracts protected cardiac toxicity at different degrees except that Curcuma longa L-EtOH had no protective effect. Phyllanthus emblica-EtOH (100 microg/ml) showed the highest cardioprotective effect (approximately 12-fold doxorubicin IC50 increase). The data demonstrate that antioxidants from natural sources may be useful in the protection of cardiotoxicity in patients who receive doxorubicin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Srinakharinwirot University, Bangkok 10110, Thailand. suvara@swu.ac.th"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wattanapitayakul", "ForeName": "Suvara K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chularojmontri", "ForeName": "Linda", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Herunsalee", "ForeName": "Angkana", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Charuchongkolwongse", "ForeName": "Suphan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Niumsakul", "ForeName": "Somchit", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bauer", "ForeName": "John A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "101208422", "ISSNLinking": "1742-7835"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiotonic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "80168379AG", "NameOfSubstance": "Doxorubicin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiotonic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Doxorubicin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Myocytes, Cardiac"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15667600", "10.1111/j.1742-7843.2005.pto960112.x", "PTOpto960112"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
