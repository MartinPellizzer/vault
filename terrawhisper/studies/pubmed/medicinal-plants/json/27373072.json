Experiments of anti-phytopathogenic fungi, cytotoxicity activity, and the 16S rRNA gene sequencing of them were carried out to evaluate the diversity and bioactivity. Strains with high activity were identified.", "A total of 277 actinomycetes were isolated, of which 111 strains were selected and assigned to 6 suborders, 7 families and 8 genera, in which Streptomyces can be divided into 10 groups. The bioactivity testing results indicated that: 30.9% isolates showed activity against at least one of the 12 phytopathogenic fungi; 44.1% strains and 33.3% strains showed cytotoxicity activity with inhibition rate above 40% against stomach cancer cell line SGC-7901 and lung cancer cell line NCI-H460 respectively.", "Actinomycetes isolated from Taxus chinensis and rhizospheric soil is of high diversity and a good source for the selection of bioactive compounds.
