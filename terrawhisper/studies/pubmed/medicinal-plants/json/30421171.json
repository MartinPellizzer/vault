In the present study, noble metal nanoparticles such as silver and gold were prepared using an aqueous leaf extract of a medicinal plant, Bauhinia purpurea. The leaf extract performed as both reducing and stabilizing agents for the development of nanoparticles. The formations of silver and gold nanoparticles were confirmed by observing the surface plasmon resonance peaks at 430\u00a0nm and 560\u00a0nm, respectively, in UV-Vis absorption spectrum. Various properties of nanoparticles were demonstrated using the characterization techniques such as FTIR, XRD, TEM, and EDX. The synthesized silver and gold nanoparticles had a momentous anticancer effect against lung carcinoma cell line A549 in a dose-dependent manner with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 27.97\u00a0\u00b5g/mL and 36.39\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, respectively. The antimicrobial studies of synthesized nanoparticles were carried out by agar well diffusion method against six microbial strains. Silver and gold nanoparticles were also showed high antioxidant potentials with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 42.37\u00a0\u00b5g/mL and 27.21\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, respectively; it was measured using DPPH assay. Additionally, the nanoparticles were observed to be good catalysts for the reduction of organic dyes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Sciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam, Kerala, 686560, India."}], "LastName": "Vijayan", "ForeName": "Remya", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, St. George's College, Aruvithura, Kottayam, Kerala, 686122, India."}], "LastName": "Joseph", "ForeName": "Siby", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Sciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam, Kerala, 686560, India. beenamscs@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Mathew", "ForeName": "Beena", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Bioprocess Biosyst Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "101088505", "ISSNLinking": "1615-7591"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-57-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Gold"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "A549 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bauhinia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gold"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Green Chemistry Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Plasmon Resonance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30421171", "10.1007/s00449-018-2035-8", "10.1007/s00449-018-2035-8"]}}]}
