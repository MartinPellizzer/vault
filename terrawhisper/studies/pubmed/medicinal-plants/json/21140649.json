This is in contrast to most of the samples of the pharmaceutical and, in part, the food industry, where primarily single compounds have to be analyzed. Recently, models for the characterization of multicomponent systems with near-IR, NMR, and MS combined with chemometric tools have been developed. However, the complexity and sophistication of such methods still prevent their general applicability to the QC of herbals. On the other hand, modern TLC is a well-established method with a long tradition. The typical chromatograms visualize even complex multicomponent systems in a special manner. The technique is rapid, comparatively simple, robust, and extremely versatile. HPTLC can not only confirm but also establish identity. It is also an ideal screening tool for adulterations and is highly suitable for evaluation and monitoring of cultivation, harvesting, and extraction processes and testing of stability. To substantiate these claims, several examples taken from daily work are provided and discussed in this paper."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zurich University of Applied Science, Institute of Biotechnology, CH-8820 W\u00e4denswil, Switzerland. beat.meier@zhaw.ch"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meier", "ForeName": "Beat", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Spriano", "ForeName": "Daniela", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J AOAC Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9215446", "ISSNLinking": "1060-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21140649"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
