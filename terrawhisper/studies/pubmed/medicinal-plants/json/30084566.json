The present study was designed to evaluate the growth promoting and immunostimulatory effect of Guduchi, Tinospora cordifolia (Thunb.) Miers ex Hook F. leaf powder in fingerlings of Amur carp (Cyprinus carpio haeYnatopterus Martens). The fingerlings were divided into four treatment groups, Ti, T2, T\u2083 and T\u2084. Experimental diets were prepared by mixing rice bran, deoiled mustard cake, soybean meal and vitamin mineral mixture. The leaf powder of T. cordifolia was incorporated into diets D\u2082, D\u2083, and D\u2084 @ 0.25%, 0.5% and 0.75%, respectively. In control diet D\u2081, leaf powder of T. cordifolia was not incorporated. T\u2081 group fishes were fed with D, diet, T2 with D\u2082, T\u2083 with D\u2083 and T\u2084 with D\u2084 @ 5% body weight per day for 90 days. Fingerlings fed with diet D\u2084 achieved significantly improved Specific Growth Rate (1), Feed Conversion Ratio (2.76), and Gross Conversion Efficiency (0.361) as compared .to the control and all other treatments (P <0.05). Hematological and biochemical parameters, total leuckocyte count (53.849x103/[L), total erythrocyte count (3.50x106/iL), hemoglobin concentration (17.17%), total serum protein, albumin and globulin (12.35, 1.56 and 10.78 g/dL) in D\u2084 diet fed fishes showed increase as compared to the control and all other treatments (P <0.05). The above research revealed that Tinospora cordifolia leaf powder has significant growth promoting and immunostimulatory potential in Amur carp raising."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Anita"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dubey", "ForeName": "Maneesh Kumar", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khati", "ForeName": "Akansha", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chauhan", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Aquaculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "growth & development", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Carps"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tinospora"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30084566"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
