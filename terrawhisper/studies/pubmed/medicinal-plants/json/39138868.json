Notably, these structurally complex molecules are not evenly distributed throughout plant tissues but are instead synthesized and stored in specific cell types. Elucidating both the biosynthesis and function of natural products would be greatly facilitated by tracking the location of these metabolites at the cell-level resolution. However, detection, identification, and quantification of metabolites in single cells, particularly from plants, have remained challenging. Here, we show that we can definitively identify and quantify the concentrations of 16 molecules from four classes of natural products in individual cells of leaf, root, and petal of the medicinal plant <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> using a plate-based single-cell mass spectrometry method. We show that identical natural products show substantially different patterns of cell-type localization in different tissues. Moreover, we show that natural products are often found in a wide range of concentrations across a population of cells, with some natural products at concentrations of over 100 mM per cell. This single-cell mass spectrometry method provides a highly resolved picture of plant natural product biosynthesis partitioning at a cell-specific resolution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7815-0426"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Product Biosynthesis, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena 07745, Germany."}], "LastName": "Vu", "ForeName": "Anh Hai", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Product Biosynthesis, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena 07745, Germany."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Moonyoung", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Product Biosynthesis, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena 07745, Germany."}], "LastName": "Wurlitzer", "ForeName": "Jens", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Product Biosynthesis, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena 07745, Germany."}], "LastName": "Heinicke", "ForeName": "Sarah", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Applied Genetic Technologies, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Crop and Soil Sciences, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, United States."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chenxin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Applied Genetic Technologies, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, United States."}], "LastName": "Wood", "ForeName": "Joshua C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microscopic Imaging Service, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena 07745, Germany."}], "LastName": "Grabe", "ForeName": "Veit", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Applied Genetic Technologies, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Crop and Soil Sciences, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Breeding, Genetics, and Genomics, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, United States."}], "LastName": "Buell", "ForeName": "C Robin", "Initials": "CR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Product Biosynthesis, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena 07745, Germany."}], "LastName": "Caputi", "ForeName": "Lorenzo", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0356-6213"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Product Biosynthesis, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena 07745, Germany."}], "LastName": "O'Connor", "ForeName": "Sarah E", "Initials": "SE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39138868", "10.1021/jacs.4c06336"]}}]}
