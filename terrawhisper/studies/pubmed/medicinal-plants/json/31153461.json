In the present study, we focused on the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and serum leptin and ghrelin in Diazinon (DZN)-induced dyslipidemia. The rats were randomly divided into five groups comprising eight animals, and all were treated via oral gavage for 28 consecutive days as follows: group one received only corn oil daily, while groups two through five received different doses of DZN dissolved in corn oil equal to 1/40, 1/20, 1/10 and 1/5 of the LD50 daily, respectively. The alteration of the serum lipid profile, such as triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), was confirmed the occurrence of dyslipidemia in the range of doses 1/20-1/5 LD50 of DZN. Although no changes were found in the serum leptin levels, a significant increase was observed in the size of adipocytes, as well as in the TNF-\u03b1 and ghrelin serum levels, and in the accumulation of epididymal fat, especially at a dose of 1/5 LD50 of DZN. It seems that interactions among the inflammatory reaction, cholinergic pathways and ghrelin secretion may be effective causes of DZN-induced dyslipidemia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
