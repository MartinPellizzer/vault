A major proportion of NMOSD cases have a relationship with autoimmunity to aquaporin 4 (AQP4) found on the central nervous system. NMOSD can occur repeatedly, causing symptoms such as decreased vision and weakness of limbs. The main goal of the current therapy is to relieve acute symptoms and prevent recurrence of the disease. Without timely and appropriate treatment, the recurrence and disability rates are high. In the present work, we review recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with NMOSD, as well as the pathogenesis and mechanisms of AQP4-IgG-seropositive NMOSD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, 530021, Nanning,China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, 530021, Nanning,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Kaijun", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, 530021, Nanning,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, 530021, Nanning,China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Ruitong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, 530021, Nanning,China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Meifeng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, 530021, Nanning,China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Jianfeng", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Doheny Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90033,United States."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xiaoyu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory of Southwest Endangered Medicinal Resources Development, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, 530023, Nanning,China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Xiaosheng", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aquaporin 4"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Autoantibodies"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aquaporin 4"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Autoantibodies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neuromyelitis Optica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spinal Cord"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "50"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33781189", "10.2174/1381612827666210329101335", "CPD-EPUB-115076"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
