In this study, eight new diterpenoids of jatrophane and ingenane type, 1-8, and three known ones (9-11) were isolated from Euphorbia glomerulans. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations. The MDR reversal activity evaluation of these isolates on breast cancer MCF-7/ADR cells demonstrated the four potent MDR modulators (3, 4, 5, and 9) with great chemoreversal ability and low cytotoxicity. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis indicated that the presence of isobutanoyloxy group at C-8 significantly enhance reversal efficiency. Compound 5 exhibited high efficacy (EC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0159.5\u00a0nM) in reversing MDR resistance, being stronger than verapamil (EC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0302.9\u00a0nM). The MDR reversal mechanism assays revealed that 5 could promote the accumulation of Rh123 and DOX in drug-resistant cells in a certain dose-dependent manner, and inhibit P-gp transport function. In addition, the possible recognition mechanism of compound 5 and verapamil (VRP) with P-gp was predicted by molecular docking."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
