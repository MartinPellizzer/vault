Inhibition of seed germination and seedling growth of maize and broad bean increased with increases in toxin concentration. A reduction in carbohydrates in the shoot systems of maize and broad bean was accompanied by a corresponding reduction in chlorophyll content. The total proteins and total lipids of V. faba were significantly greater at a 10 micrograms/ml concentration of aflatoxin G1, whereas in Z. mays significant inhibition (p < 0.05) was observed. At 5.0 micrograms/ml aflatoxin G1 lipids and proteins were reduced in both plants but the effect was less obvious at lower concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Faculty of Science, Minia University, Egypt."}], "LastName": "el-Naghy", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fadl-Allah", "ForeName": "E M", "Initials": "EM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Samhan", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cytobios", "NlmUniqueID": "0207227", "ISSNLinking": "0011-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1DB78J7PUD", "NameOfSubstance": "aflatoxin G1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10418120"]}}]}
