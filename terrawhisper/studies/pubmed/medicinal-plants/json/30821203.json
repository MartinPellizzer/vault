Sage crops are threatened by many diseases, such as gray mold, powdery mildew, and leaf spot, by weeds, and by pests, such as aphids. Use of crop protection products may lead to presence of pesticide residues in this herb. The aim of this work was to study presence of pesticide residues in the herb, S. officinalis L., available on the retail market in Poland, to verify their compliance with the maximum residue levels (MRLs) and to assess the chronic and acute risks associated with consumption of this herb and infusions prepared from contaminated sage plants. Ninety active substances of pesticides were analyzed, including all active substances registered in Poland for protection of the sage. Five active substances were found, one fungicide - boscalid and four insecticides: chlorpyrifos, pp'-DDT, dimethoate (residue levels above MRL) and indoxacarb. The chronic and acute exposure to pesticide residues consumed with sage did not exceed 0.02% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) and 0.1% of the acute reference dose (ARfD), respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Biotechnology , University of Rzeszow , Rzesz\u00f3w , Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Laboratory of Pesticide Residue Analysis , Regional Experimental Station, Institute of Plant Protection, National Research Institute , Rzesz\u00f3w , Poland."}], "LastName": "Szpyrka", "ForeName": "Ewa", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Biotechnology , University of Rzeszow , Rzesz\u00f3w , Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Laboratory of Pesticide Residue Analysis , Regional Experimental Station, Institute of Plant Protection, National Research Institute , Rzesz\u00f3w , Poland."}], "LastName": "S\u0142owik-Borowiec", "ForeName": "Magdalena", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health B", "NlmUniqueID": "7607167", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Teas, Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia officinalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Teas, Herbal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30821203", "10.1080/03601234.2018.1501144"]}}]}
