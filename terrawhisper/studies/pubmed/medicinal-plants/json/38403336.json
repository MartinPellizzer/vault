However, due to the problems of sample contamination and cleaning, this technology has been applied less frequently in the tracing of plant remains. The Palace Museum preserves more than 1 000 relics of medicinal materials from the Forbidden City of the Qing Dynasty, which are rare precious materials for the study of Dao-di herbs. The well-preserved environment of these medicinal materials in the Forbidden City of the Qing Dynasty helps avoid external strontium contamination, making it possible to introduce strontium isotope technology in their tracing research. On this basis, this study discussed the principle of strontium isotope tracing technology and summarized the current research progress on tracing plant remains using strontium isotope. In addition, this study discussed three key problems and their respective solutions encountered when applying strontium isotope technology to the tracing research on medicinal materials from the Forbidden City of the Qing Dynasty: creating strontium isotope ratio maps, dealing with the wide range of traceable results, and addressing the sample contamination and cleaning challenges. The literature and historical materials of the Qing Dynasty are the important basis for understanding the distribution and application of Dao-di herbs in the Qing Dynasty. Based on literature research, the use of strontium isotope to trace the producing area of medicinal materials in the Forbidden City of the Qing Dynasty can provide physical evidence for relevant research. The combined evidence of historical materials and medicinal relics is expected to provide a new perspective for the study of Dao-di herbs in the Qing Dynasty and also provide a reference for the study of the revolution of Dao-di herbs producing areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Assurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China Key Scientific Research Base of Traditional Chinese Medicine Heritage (Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences),State Administration of Cultural Heritage Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Yun-Lu", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Assurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China Key Scientific Research Base of Traditional Chinese Medicine Heritage (Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences),State Administration of Cultural Heritage Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Hua-Sheng", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Scientific Research Base of Traditional Chinese Medicine Heritage (Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences),State Administration of Cultural Heritage Beijing 100700, China Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Strontium Isotopes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Strontium Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38403336", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20230902.101"]}}]}
