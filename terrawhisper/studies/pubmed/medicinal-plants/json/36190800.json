There is a great demand for new sources to treat this disease. Medicinal plants are an indispensable source of bioactive compounds with wide range of pharmacological activities. <i>In-vitro</i> cytotoxic activity of <i>Otostegia fruticosa</i> methanolic extract against human breast cancer was studied using MCF-7 cell line. The extract showed mildly potent activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 51\u2009\u00b1\u20099.836\u2009\u00b5g/mL) in comparison to the standard anticancer doxorubicin (IC<sub>50</sub> = 7.467\u2009\u00b1\u20091.05\u2009\u00b5g/mL). Potential compounds responsible for activity have been identified using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) module on the major compounds detected by HPLC-MS/MS technique against estrogen alpha receptor (ER\u03b1+: PDB ID 2JF9). 3,5-di-<i>O</i>-dicaffeoylquinic acid, hyperoside and rutin showed similar binding and antagonistic interaction with the estrogen alpha receptor as tamoxifen in several poses. The retrieved results confirm that we can add this plant to a powerful arsenal that combats this insidious disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Sana'a University, Sana'a, Yemen."}], "LastName": "Al-Madhagy", "ForeName": "Somaia A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, October University for Modern Sciences and Arts (MSA), Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Gad", "ForeName": "Sameh S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, October University for Modern Sciences and Arts (MSA), Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mostafa", "ForeName": "Eman S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, University of Camerino, Camerino, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "RICH - Research and Innovation Coffee Hub, Belforte del Chienti (MC), Italy."}], "LastName": "Angeloni", "ForeName": "Simone", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Gulf Medical University, Ajman, United Arab Emirates."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Saad", "ForeName": "Muhammed A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5796-2708"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Heliopolis University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Sabry", "ForeName": "Omar M", "Initials": "OM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5530-877X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, University of Camerino, Camerino, Italy."}], "LastName": "Caprioli", "ForeName": "Giovanni", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "El-Hawary", "ForeName": "Seham S", "Initials": "SS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36190800", "10.1080/14786419.2022.2130306"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
