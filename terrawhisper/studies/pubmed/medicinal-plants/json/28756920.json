At an extract concentration of 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, 4 isolates out of 12 showed high activity against the cancer cell growth. The four isolates were then selected for further IC<sub>50</sub> determination, by measuring the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation at extract concentration of 25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, 200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and 400\u00a0\u03bcg/mL.", "Results showed that isolate Sir-G5 had the highest anticancer activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 19.20\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. The best isolates were screened again using a normal cell (Chang cells) to determine its toxicity against normal cells. Results indicated that the extracts do not affect the proliferation of normal cells. Molecular identification showed that the fungal isolate Sir-G5 has a close relationship with Phomopsis sp.", "The endophytic fungi isolated from soursop leaf has the potential to be used as a source of anticancer agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Hainan Medical University.
