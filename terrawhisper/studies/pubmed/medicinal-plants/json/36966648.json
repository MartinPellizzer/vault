Thus, this study investigated the mitigating potentials of the ligands; n-hexadecanoic acid, 9-octadecenoic acid and octadecanoic acid from Copaifera salikounda seed pond extract reported to have antidiabetic potentials in our previous study using computational techniques. Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1) were identified as potential receptors. Both molecular docking and Estimated \u0394Gbind revealed that each ligand exhibited high binding affinity to the respective proteins; this is quite sufficient to be termed favourable. A critical examination of the type and the nature of binding interactions and energy contributions have identified Arg106, Arg126 and Tyr128 in FABP4 and Gln277, Ser280, Tyr314, His440 and Tyr464 in PPAR\u03b1 as consistently being responsible for the binding interactions and stabilizations of each ligand to the individual proteins. The establishment of hydrogen bonding type of interaction and activity between the carboxylic acid moieties of these ligands and these crucial/unique residues goes further to buttress our assertion. A general study of the conformational state of these protein via RMSF and PCA plots goes further validate the observed structural trends wherein the presence of ligands induced seemly structural rigidity. In depth structural stability investigations went further to reveal that the 3D structures of these protein didn't deviate from it known native conformational stable state when bound with these ligands. Our findings indicate that the ligands have considerable inhibitory action against FABP4 and PPAR\u03b1 corroborating the reported antidiabetic potential of the extract."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
