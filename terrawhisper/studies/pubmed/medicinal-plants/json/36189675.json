Thus, in this study, chitosan-alginate (CA) membranes containing DHA and MSCs were produced, and their antibacterial and antibiofilm activities against burn infections caused by <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> were investigated.<b>Methods:</b> Physicochemical properties were assessed by SEM, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Porosity, cytocompatibility, and antibacterial and antibiofilm activities were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The viability and apoptosis of MSCs were studied using flow cytometry. Wound healing effects were analyzed based on histopathological features, the wound contraction rate (WCR) ratio, and bacterial clearance.<b>Results:</b> The CA membranes showed antibiofilm activity both in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by reduced <i>lasI</i> and <i>rhlI</i> expressions and pyocyanin production. The membranes were highly porous and biocompatible and showed favorable physicochemical properties. Docosahexaenoic acid incorporation to CA membranes improved their antibacterial and antibiofilm activities, as well as MSCs' viability by reducing crystallinity and increasing porosity (<i>p = .008</i>). Treatment with CA-DHA-MSC accelerated burn wound healing (with complete healing being observed after 14 days, WCR = 85%) and augmented antibacterial and antibiofilm activities in vivo compared to CA-DHA and CA-MSC. The CA-DHA-MSC group delivered a significantly higher WCR and lower inflammation than the CA-MSC group (<i>p</i> = .0001).<b>Conclusion:</b> In combination with DHA-loaded CA membranes, MSCs reduced the healing time of burn wounds, offering a viable option for designing effective wound dressings."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "48443Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaneialvar", "ForeName": "Hori", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kazan (Volga Region) Federal University, Kazan, Russia."}], "LastName": "Kayumov", "ForeName": "Airat", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Parasitology and Mycology, Faculty of Paramedical Science, 48443Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aboualigalehdari", "ForeName": "Elham", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, 48443Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Pakzad", "ForeName": "Iraj", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Stem Cells Technology Research Center, Stem Cells Research Institute, 48435Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tanideh", "ForeName": "Nader", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "48443Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Medical School, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbasi", "ForeName": "Naser", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3387-9379"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Microbiology Research Center, 48443Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Haddadi", "ForeName": "Mohammad Hossein", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biomater Appl", "NlmUniqueID": "8813912", "ISSNLinking": "0885-3282"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9012-76-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Chitosan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alginates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "25167-62-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Docosahexaenoic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chitosan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alginates"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Docosahexaenoic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Burns"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "8"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36189675", "10.1177/08853282221131130"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
