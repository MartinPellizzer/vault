However, the artemisinin content in the existing varieties of this plant is very low. In this study, we found that the environmental factors light and phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) could synergistically promote the expression of artemisinin biosynthetic genes. Notably, the increased expression levels of those genes regulated by ABA depended on light. Gene expression analysis found that AaABI5, a transcription factor belonging to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family, was inducible by the light and ABA treatment. Analysis of AaABI5-overexpressing and -suppressing lines suggested that AaABI5 could enhance artemisinin biosynthesis and activate the expression of four core biosynthetic genes. In addition, the key regulator of light-induced artemisinin biosynthesis, AaHY5, could bind to the promoter of AaABI5 and activate its expression. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that AaABI5 acts as an important molecular junction for the synergistic promotion of artemisinin biosynthesis by light and ABA signals, which provides a candidate gene for developing new germplasms of high-quality A. annua."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
