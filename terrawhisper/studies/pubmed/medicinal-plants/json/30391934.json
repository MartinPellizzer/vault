We aimed to determine the prevalence, pattern, and associated factors for the use of medicinal plants among patients with dyslipidemia. Methods A 17-item semi-structured questionnaire was filled out by 195 patients with dyslipidemia in a cross-sectional study carried out in two academic endocrinology clinics in Shiraz, Iran. The questionnaire comprised of three main domains of demographic data (6 questions), clinical data (2 of them), and data related to the use of medicinal plants (totally 9 questions). Results A total of 77.4% of patients took medicinal plants. The most common medicinal herbs used by dyslipidemic patients were Zataria multiflora, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, and Zingiber officinale. Duration of dyslipidemia was significantly longer in herbal users than non-herbal users (p=0.04). Patients believing that concomitant use of conventional drugs and herbal preparations had synergic positive effects in addition to those persuaded that herbal preparations possessed less side effects, were significantly more likely to use medicinal plants (p=0.008 and 0.005, respectively). Additionally, most of the medicinal herb users (87.4%) changed neither the pattern nor the dosage of their medications all during herbal preparations use. Conclusions This study demonstrated a high prevalence of medicinal plants' use among patients with dyslipidemia, which was associated with the duration of dyslipidemia, patients' viewpoints about herbal preparations' synergic positive effects, and their fewer side effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Medicine, Fasa University of Medical Sciences, Fasa, Iran (Islamic Republic of)."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Noncommunicable Diseases Research Center, Fasa University of Medical Sciences, Fasa, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hashempur", "ForeName": "Mohammad Hashem", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran (Islamic Republic of)."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Psychiatry and Behavior Science, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran (Islamic Republic of)."}], "LastName": "Mosavat", "ForeName": "Seyed Hamdollah", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran (Islamic Republic of)."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran (Islamic Republic of)."}], "LastName": "Heydari", "ForeName": "Mojtaba", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrine and Metabolism Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran (Islamic Republic of)."}], "LastName": "Shams", "ForeName": "Mesbah", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Complement Integr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101313855", "ISSNLinking": "1553-3840"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dyslipidemias"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30391934", "10.1515/jcim-2018-0101", "/j/jcim.ahead-of-print/jcim-2018-0101/jcim-2018-0101.xml"]}}]}
