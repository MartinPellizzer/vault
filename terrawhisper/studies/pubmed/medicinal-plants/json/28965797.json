Cardiovascular prevention is based on effective control of these conditions. In adult subjects with mild hypercholesterolemia we compared in the real life the effects of a new combination of nutraceuticals on lipid and glucose metabolism and blood pressure with those of an established nutraceutical combination.", "This multicenter, controlled, randomized, single-blind trial was designed to compare the effect of Armolipid Plus<sup>\u00ae</sup> versus that of LopiGLIK<sup>\u00ae</sup> on lipid and glucose levels and blood pressure (BP) in subjects with mild hypercholesterolemia not on statin therapy. Primary outcome was the proportion of subjects achieving therapeutic targets of LDL-C (<130\u00a0mg/dl); secondary outcomes were the effects on HDL-C, glycated haemoglobin and insulin levels. Data from an overall sample of 359 adult individuals (age 55.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.1 years, women 57.7%, LDL-C 157.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.6\u00a0mg/dl, HDL-C 50.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.0\u00a0mg/dl) are reported. 72% of subjects treated with LopiGLIK<sup>\u00ae</sup> and 43% treated with Armolipid Plus<sup>\u00ae</sup> achieved the primary endpoint (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Both treatments reduced plasma levels of total and LDL-C and triglycerides (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for all comparisons). The treatments also reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma levels of glycated haemoglobin, insulin and HOMA index. The changes induced by LopiGLIK<sup>\u00ae</sup> in all these metabolic parameters were greater than those obtained with Armolipid Plus<sup>\u00ae</sup>.", "The present analysis shows that LopiGLIK<sup>\u00ae</sup> may represent a more effective tool for clinical management of CV risk factors in subjects with mild hypercholesterolemia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.
