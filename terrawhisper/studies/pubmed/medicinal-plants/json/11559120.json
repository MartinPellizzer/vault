However, the oxalate content of seeds from 11 cultivars of soybean showed relatively high levels of total oxalate from 0.67 to 3.5 g/100 g of dry weight. Oxalate primarily was found as calcium oxalate crystals. Thirteen tested commercial soyfoods contained between 16 and 638 mg of total oxalate per serving. These values compare to those of three other legume foods, peanut butter, refried beans, and lentils, which contained 197, 193, and 100 mg of total oxalate per serving, respectively. After oxalate has been absorbed from the diet, it cannot be metabolized and is excreted by the kidney into urine, where it binds to calcium forming an insoluble salt that may precipitate to form kidney stones. The amounts of total oxalate in soybean seeds, soy foods, and other common legume foods exceed current recommendations for oxalate consumption by individuals who have a history of calcium oxalate kidney/urinary stones. This study serves as the basis to find soybean cultivars lower in oxalate, which will have lower risk for kidney stone formation after human consumption."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, Washington State University, Spokane, Washington 99201, USA. massey@wsu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Massey", "ForeName": "L K", "Initials": "LK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Palmer", "ForeName": "R G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horner", "ForeName": "H T", "Initials": "HT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxalates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2612HC57YE", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Oxalate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Oxalate"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Calculi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxalates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11559120", "10.1021/jf010484y", "jf010484y"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
