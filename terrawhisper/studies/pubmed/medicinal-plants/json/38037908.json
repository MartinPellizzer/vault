It is usually related to intravascular leaking, bleeding disorders, and thrombocytopenia and is recognized as a potent threat to humans. The scarcity of anti-dengue medication or vaccine for such a serious disease leads to an upsurge in the usage of traditional medicines for its proper management. India has diverse biodiversity and a long history of using plant-based remedies. Several medicinal plant extracts have been studied for producing anti-dengue viral activity. AYUSH traditional systems provide a plethora of plants that have been reported to be useful in the treatment of fever. Single and compound plant- based formulations in natural form have been used in Unani holistic approaches. This review serves as a new approach to illustrate the most recent evidence regarding the antiviral activity of various plants by providing scientific proof and also to validate the traditional formulations as effective treatments in dengue fever for global acceptance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at
