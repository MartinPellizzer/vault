The suspension of Zhikeping and simvastatin were administered intragastrically, respectively. After 10 weeks, the serum lipids, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and maleic dialdehyde (MDA) were detected by automatic biochemistry analyzer. ICAM-1 and its expression of mRNA in aortic wall were detected- by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, respectively. Aortic histomorphology was cbserved by HE stainning.", "The results showed that the serum lipids, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and maleic dialdehyde (MDA) of treated groups were obviously improved as compared with those of the control group.
