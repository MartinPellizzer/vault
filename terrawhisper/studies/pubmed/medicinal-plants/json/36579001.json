More efforts have been conducted the use of natural products such as plant essential oils and their new formulations against disease vectors. Nanoformulation techniques are expected to reduce volatility and increase larvicidal efficacy of essential oils. In this study for the first time, a larvicide nanoemulsion from the essential oil of <i>Acroptilon repens</i> was developed and evaluated against <i>Anopheles stephensi</i> larvae under laboratory conditions.", "Fresh samples of <i>A. repens</i> plant were collected from Urmia, West Azarbaijan Province, Iran. A clevenger type apparatus was used for extracting oil. Components of <i>A. repens</i> essential oil (AEO) were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). All larvicidal bioassay tests were performed according to the method recommended by the World Health Organization under laboratory condition. Particle size and the morphologies of all prepared nanoformulations determined by DLS and TEM analysis.", "A total of 111 compounds were identified in plant. The LC<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>90</sub> values of AEO calculated as 7 ppm and 35 ppm respectively. AEO was able to kill 100% of the larvae in 4 days.", "The nanoemulsion of AEO showed a weak effect on the larvar mortality. It may therefore be suggested that this kind of nanoemulsion is not appropriate for the formulation as a larvicide. It is important to screen native plant natural products, search for new materials and prepare new formulations to develop alternative interventions with a long-lasting impact."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
