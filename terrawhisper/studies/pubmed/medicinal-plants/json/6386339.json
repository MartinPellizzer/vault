With ever rising costs of meats, fresh fruits, and vegetables, dry beans are expected to contribute more to the human nutrition in coming years. Traditionally, they have been referred to as \"poor man's meat\" and have contributed significantly to the diets of many people of several countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and South America. In recent years, a renewed interest in bean research in Western European countries and the U.S. is evident. In this review, certain biochemical, technological, nutritional, and toxicological aspects are discussed and the limitations and problems associated with dry beans of Phaseolus as human food are addressed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Deshpande", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sathe", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Salunkhe", "ForeName": "D K", "Initials": "DK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "463"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6386339", "10.1080/10408398409527399"]}}]}
