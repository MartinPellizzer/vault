However, its possible gastroprotective effect has not yet been experimentally evaluated.", "This study evaluated the gastroprotective effect of aqueous extracts obtained through hot and room temperature maceration of A. absinthium aerial parts in rats.", "The gastroprotective effect of hot aqueous extract (HAE) and room temperature aqueous extract (RTAE) from A. absinthium aerial parts were evaluated in rats using a model of acute gastric ulcer induced by ethanol p.a. The stomachs were collected to measure the gastric lesion area and histological and biochemical analysis. UHPLC-HRMS/MS analysis was used to determine the chemical profile of the extracts.", "Eight main peaks in the UHPLC chromatogram were identified in both HAE and RTAE extracts: tuberonic acid glycoside (1), rupicolin (2), 2-hydroxyeupatolide (3), yangabin (4), sesartemin (5), artemetin (6), isoalantodiene (7), and dehydroartemorin (8). For RTAE, a higher diversity of sesquiterpene lactones was observed. The groups treated with RTAE at 3%, 10%, and 30% presented a gastroprotective effect, reducing the lesion area by 64.68%, 53.71%, and 90.04%, respectively, when compared with the vehicle (VEH)-treated group. On the other hand, the groups treated with HAE at 3%, 10%, and 30% presented values of lesion areas higher than those of the VEH group. Changes in the submucosa layer, inflammatory process with edema, cellular infiltration, and mucin depletion were detected in the gastric mucosa exposed to ethanol, which was fully prevented by RTAE treatment. Neither HAE nor RTAE could increase the reduced glutathione levels in the injured gastric tissue, but RTAE (30%) reduced the formation of lipid hydroperoxides. When the rats were pre-treated with NEM (a chelator of non-protein thiols) or L-NAME (non-selective nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), the RTAE lost the ability to protect the gastric mucosa.", "This study corroborates the ethnopharmacological use of this specie to treat gastric disorders revealing the gastroprotective effect of the room-temperature aqueous extract of A. absinthium aerial parts. Its mode of action may involve the ability of the infusion to maintain the gastric mucosal barrier integrity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
