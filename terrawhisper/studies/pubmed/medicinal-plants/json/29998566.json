This study evaluates the effect of PV panels installed on the roofs of greenhouses, and the partial shading that they cause, on the growth parameters and growth indicators of the experimental cultivation of peppers (Capsicum annuum cv. California Wonder). The growth of the plants, the antioxidant profile, radical scavenging activity, total phenolic content, and the phenolic and metabolic profiles (using LC-MS spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy) are evaluated.", "Data are presented from a full cultivation period. Results indicated that indoor temperatures were similar for both glass and glass-PV (glass with PV panels installed) greenhouses during the day and the night. The production yield was higher for the glass-PV greenhouses. The pepper fruits' weight, dimensions, and thickness were similar in both cases. Comparison of the pepper fruit extracts in terms of total phenolic content, antioxidant, and antiradical activities indicated differences that were not statistically significant. Photometric and spectroscopic studies both showed a smaller distribution of values in the case of the glass-PV greenhouse, probably indicating a more consistent phytochemical profile.", "Covering only a small proportion (ca. 20%) of the greenhouse roof with photovoltaic panels contributes considerably to its energy demands without affecting plant growth and quality. \u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Technology, TEI of Western Greece, Campus Amaliada, Greece."}], "LastName": "Kavga", "ForeName": "Angeliki", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Chemistry, Analysis & Design of Food Processes, Department of Food Science and Technology, University of West Attica, Egaleo, Greece."}], "LastName": "Strati", "ForeName": "Irini F", "Initials": "IF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Chemistry, Analysis & Design of Food Processes, Department of Food Science and Technology, University of West Attica, Egaleo, Greece."}], "LastName": "Sinanoglou", "ForeName": "Vassilia J", "Initials": "VJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biology, Medicinal Chemistry and Biotechnology, National Hellenic Research Foundation, 48 Vas.
