Through his work with indigenous people in Brazil, French Guiana, Suriname, and Venezuela, he has categorized more than 300 shaman plant cures. Plotkin studied ethnobotany at Harvard, Yale, and Tufts, and is the first botanist to receive the San Diego Zoological Society's Conservation Medal. He previously served as director of plant conservation at the World Wildlife Fund, the world's largest conservation organization, and as vice president of Conservation International. Founder of the \"Shaman's Apprentice Program,\" which encourages younger tribal members to apprentice under the aging shamans, Plotkin currently devotes his time to curative plant research, consultation, lecturing, writing, and fund raising for his new organization, the Conservation and Ethnobiology Alliance. He has published numerous scientific articles and is the author of the popular book, Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Plotkin", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Interview"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Altern Ther Health Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9502013", "ISSNLinking": "1078-6791"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mental Healing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8795891"]}}]}
