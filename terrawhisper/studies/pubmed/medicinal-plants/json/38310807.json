An ultrafiltration-based method has been developed for rapid preparation of total and fractional polysaccharides from Radix Astragali in high yield and purity. This method involves extraction of plant material by hot water, treatment with Sevag reagent, and ultrafiltration using molecular weight cutoff concentrators. The prepared polysaccharides were assessed by <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy, providing general purity, fingerprinting, and structural information. This method may be used to efficiently screen polysaccharides in plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
