Patients' movements within these landscapes are possible thanks to each person's web of relations. Medical landscapes are not fixed, but vary and dynamically change for each person, depending on their fluid and interchanging, hierarchical webs of mutual relations with other people, personal bodies, institutions, discourses, political powers, other non-human organisms, or objects such as medicines. This paper was inspired by the medicoscape concept (H\u00f6rbst and Krause 2004 ) as well as Ingold's idea of meshwork analyses of relations between various actors: in this case, patients, healers, a weak state, official healthcare providers, pharmacists and medicinal plants, in the context of patients' therapeutic choices. Self-medication based on herbal remedies is a very important feature of people's medical landscapes in Central Ukraine and usually the first therapy choice for most interlocutors. That is why this paper is focused on the presentation of the means through which people acquire knowledge about medicinal plants, and the ways they interact with plants and plants interact with them. In this way, showing the complexity of villagers' webs of relations is possible. The analysis is based on ethnographic research conducted between 2009 and 2013 in the Vinnytsia region (Central Ukraine)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a University of Warsaw , Warsaw , Poland."}], "LastName": "Ko\u0142odziejska-Deg\u00f3rska", "ForeName": "Iwona", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Anthropol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9709920", "ISSNLinking": "1364-8470"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anthropology, Medical"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services Accessibility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Patient Acceptance of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Self Medication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trust"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ukraine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27362484", "10.1080/13648470.2016.1180583"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
