Although they are generally presumed safe unless a significant risk has been identified in humans, increasing number of case reports notify acute or chronic intoxications resulting from their use. This study aims to produce a scientific guide for the evaluation of traditional herbal medicines (THMs) in terms of their toxicity risks based on the published regulatory documents. For this purpose recommended in vitro and in vivo toxicity tests on medicinal products for human use issued by the international regulatory bodies are overviewed and they are then adopted to be used for the toxicity assessment of THMs. Accordingly, based on compilation of these issued regulations, the following tests are recommended for the toxicity assessment of THMs; in vitrocytotoxicity, genotoxicity, acute and repeated dose toxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, local tolerance tests, toxicokinetic studies, and additional toxicity tests including safety pharmacology, immunotoxicity and antigenicity, endocrine system toxicity, gastro-intestinal toxicity, renal and hepatotoxicity, and drug interaction studies. This study describes and discusses the applicability of these tests for the risk assessment in THMs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ayd\u03b9n", "ForeName": "Ahmet", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aktay", "ForeName": "G\u00f6knur", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yesilada", "ForeName": "Erdem", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Commun", "NlmUniqueID": "101477873", "ISSNLinking": "1555-9475"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patient Safety"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30475523"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
