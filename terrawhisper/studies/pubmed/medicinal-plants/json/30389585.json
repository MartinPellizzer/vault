Monoterpenes have shown that promising profile as agents which reduce the inflammatory process and also modulate the key chemical mediators of inflammation, such as pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The main interest focused on monoterpenes were to develop the analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs. In this review, we summarized current knowledge on monoterpenes that produce anti-inflammatory effects by modulating the release of cytokines, as well as suggesting that which monoterpenoid molecules may be most effective in the treatment of inflammatory disease. Several different inflammatory markers were evaluated as a target of monoterpenes. The proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were found TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-5, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 IL-13, IL-17A, IFN\u03b3, TGF-\u03b21 and IFN-\u03b3. Our review found evidence that NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling are important pathways for the anti-inflammatory action of monoterpenes. We found 24 monoterpenes that modulate the production of cytokines, which appears to be the major pharmacological mechanism these compounds possess in relation to the attenuation of inflammatory response. Despite the compelling evidence supporting the anti-inflammatory effect of monoterpenes, further studies are necessary to fully explore their potential as anti-inflammatory compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
