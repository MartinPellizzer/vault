Earlier studies, including in vitro genotoxicity tests, indicated that 4-MeQ is more mutagenic than QN. However, we hypothesized that the methyl group of 4-MeQ favors detoxication over bioactivation, and this factor may be overlooked in in vitro tests that do not incorporate supplementation with cofactors for enzymes that catalyze conjugation reactions. We used human induced hepatocyte cells (hiHeps), which express such enzymes, and compared the genotoxicity of 4-MeQ and QN. We also carried out an in vivo micronucleus (MN) test in rat liver, since 4-MeQ is not genotoxic in rodent bone marrow. In the Ames test and the Tk gene mutation assay, with rat S9 activation, 4-MeQ was more mutagenic than QN. However, QN induced significantly higher MN frequencies in hiHeps and rat liver than did 4-MeQ. Furthermore, QN upregulated genotoxicity marker genes much more than did 4-MeQ. We also investigated the roles of two important detoxication enzymes, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs). When hiHeps were preincubated with hesperetin (UGT inhibitor) and 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol (SULT inhibitor), MN frequencies were elevated approximately 1.5-fold for 4-MeQ, whereas no significant effects were seen for QN. This study shows that QN is more genotoxic than 4-MeQ, when the roles of SULTs and UGTs in detoxication are considered and our results may improve understanding the structure-activity relationships of quinoline derivatives."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
