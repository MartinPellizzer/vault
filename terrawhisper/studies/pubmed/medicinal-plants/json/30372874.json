Previous studies have demonstrated that d-galactose (DG) imitates human natural aging. EA has also shown many pharmacological properties including anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities.", "In the present study, we are aimed to evaluate anti-aging effects of EA (0.01-10\u2009\u03bcM) on DG-induced aging model in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, using assessment of cell proliferation, lipid peroxidation (MDA), intra-cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammation (TNF-\u03b1), total glutathione content (GSH), Beta-Galactosidase (\u03b2-GAL) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) levels. Furthermore, the effects of EA were examined on HO-1 or PPAR-\u03b3\u2009pathways using their selective inhibitors ZnPP or GW9662, respectively.", "The results revealed that EA (0.01-10\u2009\u03bcM) significantly increased cell proliferation and GSH level, while decreased the levels of ROS, MDA, TNF-\u03b1,\u2009\u03b2-GAL\u2009and AGEs following DG-induced aging. Our findings also presented that pre-incubation with ZnPP exacerbates toxicity features of DG-induced aging in all measured parameters. Furthermore, we showed that pre-incubation of EA (0.1 and 1\u2009\u03bcM) with either GW9662 or ZnPP significantly prevents the protective activities on cell proliferation, ROS, MDA, GSH and TNF-\u03b1 levels following DG-induced aging (p\u2009<\u20090.001 for all cases). Additionally, EA (0.1 and 1\u2009\u03bcM) along with GW9662 did not affect the levels of \u03b2-GAL and AGES in comparison to DG-induced aging group.", "Although we described for the first time that EA at low concentrations (0.1-1\u2009\u03bcM) provides greater antiaging properties than both its high concentration (10\u2009\u03bcM) and metformin (2.5\u2009mM) probably through PPAR-\u03b3/HO-1 signaling pathway, but additional and deeper investigations are needed to show exact involving mechanisms. It could be suggestible that EA may be as anti-aging agent at low concentrations for age-related neurological disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
