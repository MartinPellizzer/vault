Currently, 893 million people in 49 countries worldwide affected by lymphatic filariasis as per WHO statistics. The concealed aspects of lymphatic diseases such as delayed disease detection, inappropriate disease imaging, the geographical outbreak of infection, and lack of preventive chemotherapy have brought this epidemic to the edge of Neglected Tropical Diseases. Many medications and natural bioactive substances have seen to promote filaricidal activity against the target parasitic species. However, the majority of failures have occurred in pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic issues.", "The purpose of the study is to focus on the challenges and therapeutic issues in the treatment of filariasis. The review brings novel techniques and therapeutic approaches for combating lymphatic filariasis. It also offers significant developments and opportunities for such therapeutic interventions.", "Through this review, an attempt has made to critically evaluate the avenues of innovative pharmaceuticals and molecular targeting approaches to bring an integrated solution to combat lymphatic filariasis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shri Rawatpura Sarkar Institute of Pharmacy, Kumhari, Durg, Chhattisgarh, 490042, India."}], "LastName": "Shrivastava", "ForeName": "Saurabh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shri Rawatpura Sarkar Institute of Pharmacy, Kumhari, Durg, Chhattisgarh, 490042, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Anshita", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shri Rawatpura Sarkar Institute of Pharmacy, Kumhari, Durg, Chhattisgarh, 490042, India."}], "LastName": "Kaur", "ForeName": "Chanchal Deep", "Initials": "CD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "100960531", "ISSNLinking": "1389-4501"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiparasitic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiparasitic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "prevention & control", "therapy", "transmission"], "DescriptorName": "Elephantiasis, Filarial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epigenesis, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Government Programs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphatic System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patents as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32603280", "10.2174/1389450121666200630111250", "CDT-EPUB-107787"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
