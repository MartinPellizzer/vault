The DCD-684 (0.03-3ml/kg.bw) administered orally in acute (7-days) and sub-acute toxicity (14-days) tests, displayed neither mortality nor toxicological changes in physical, behavioral, biochemical and histopathological parameters. In chronic study (90-days), DCD-684 (0.3-12ml/kg.bw) also revealed no changes. However, at 18 and 36 ml/kg.bw, liver demonstrated mild inflammation correlating with raised aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) levels. Increased levels of urea and inflamed renal parenchyma indicated mild nephro-toxicity with high alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 36ml/kg.bw. The LD50 of DCD-684 in mice was 27.5 ml/kg.bw. In hepatocytes at 36ml/kg.bw, elevated mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines were evident. DCD-684 neither damaged DNA nor induced cytotoxicity in micronucleus assay. In conclusion, polyherbal DCD-684 caused neither hepatic, renal, genotoxicity nor any undesirable effect in mice. Higher doses administered for 90 days showed mild toxic effects with no sign of necrosis, fibrosis or genotoxicity. Thus, in mice DCD-684 demonstrated a wide margin of safety to be used for the relief of infantile colic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, Dow Diagnostic Reference and Research Laboratory, Laboratory Animal Sciences, Dow International Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Roome", "ForeName": "Talat", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, Dow Diagnostic Reference and Research Laboratory, Laboratory Animal Sciences, Dow International Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan/Medics Laboratories (Pvt.)
