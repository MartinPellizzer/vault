On the basis of conventional paraffin section and freehand section, the anatomical study on roots of seven Sect. Paeonia species and main roots of cultivated Paeonia lactiflora was conducted in this paper. The results showed that, there existed some differences in microstructure of the seven species such as P. lactiflora, P. obovata, P. veitchii, P. mairei, P. anomala, P. sinjiangensis and P. anomala var. intermedia, and this could be used to distinguish different species. In the roots of seven Sect. Paeonia species, distinct growth rings were formed because that the different diameters or density of xylem vessels in the secondary xylem formed clusters and arranged interrupted rings in tangential direction. There were growth rings in the main roots of P. lactiflora cultivated 1-4 years in Siping, Jilin, which were all consistent with their growth years. Due to the similar growth characteristics between wild Sect. Paeonia species and cultivated P. lactiflora, the growth rings can provide a basis for the age identification and lay the foundation for the quality evaluation of Paeoniae Radix Rubra."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Shan-Shan", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources Protection and Development, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Zha", "ForeName": "Liang-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Hai-Yan", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources Protection and Development, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Hua-Sheng", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Paeonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29235286", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0147"]}}]}
