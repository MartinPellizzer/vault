It plays a pivotal role in regulating cell signalling in the body under certain physiological and pathological conditions. In cancer cells, such as colon, breast, pancreatic, ovarian, melanoma, and lymphoma, the NF-\u03baB pathway is active. In cellular proliferation, promoting angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis of tumour cells, and blocking apoptosis, the constitutive activity of NF-\u03baB signalling has been reported. Therefore, immense attention has been given to developing drugs targeting NF-\u03baB signalling pathways to treat many types of tumours. They are a desirable therapeutic target for drugs, and many studies have concentrated on recognizing compounds. They may be able to reverse or standstill the growth and spread of tumours that selectively interfere with this pathway. Recently, numerous substances derived from plants have been evaluated as possible inhibitors of the NF-\u03baB pathway. These include various compounds, such as flavonoids, lignans, diterpenes, sesquiterpenes, polyphenols, etc. A study supported by folk medicine demonstrated that plant-derived compounds could suppress NF-\u03baB signalling. Considering this, the present review revealed the anticancer potential of naturally occurring compounds that inhibit the NF-\u03baB signalling and suppress the growth and spread of cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "M.M.College of Pharmacy, Maharishi Markandeshwar (Deemed to be) University, Mullana, Ambala, HR, India."}], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "Rina", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "M.M.College of Pharmacy, Maharishi Markandeshwar (Deemed to be) University, Mullana, Ambala, HR, India."}], "LastName": "Mehta", "ForeName": "Dinesh Kumar", "Initials": "DK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "M.M.College of Pharmacy, Maharishi Markandeshwar (Deemed to be) University, Mullana, Ambala, HR, India."}], "LastName": "Dhanawat", "ForeName": "Meenakshi", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mini Rev Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101094212", "ISSNLinking": "1389-5575"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "30"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35260052", "10.2174/1389557522666220307170126", "MRMC-EPUB-121423"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
