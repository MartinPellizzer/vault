Digitoxin was used as the substrate for biotransformation. Digoxin production was carried out in a variety of vessels, including 1-l exsiccators, 20-l glass reactors and a 300-l air-lift bioreactor. A culture volume of 200 l was established after 28 d and the cells were then cultured semi-continuously in a 300-l bioreactor employing the draw-fill cultivation method. Maximal digoxin production was achieved in an 8% glucose medium with a production optimum after 40-60 h of incubation in the presence of 0.65-0.8 mmol digitoxin per l. Levels of 0.52, 0.53 and 0.60 mmol digoxin per l suspension were achieved in 1-l, 20-l and 300-l vessels, respectively. About 80% of the digoxin produced was found in the bathing medium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmazeutisches Institut, Eberhard-Karls-Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Kreis", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Reinhard", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8411927", "ISSNLinking": "0168-1656"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Suspensions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E90NZP2L9U", "NameOfSubstance": "Digitoxin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Digitoxin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Suspensions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1369154", "10.1016/0168-1656(92)90011-w", "0168-1656(92)90011-W"]}}]}
