The ratio of hapten to bovine serum albumin (BSA) in an antigen conjugate was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization of mass spectrometry. A hybridoma secreting monoclonal antibody (MAb) was produced by fusing splenocytes immunized with an antigene-BSA conjugate with mouse myeloma cells. Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using MAb was set up as a high sensitive, specific and reproducible qualitative method. A method of determination for ginsenosides by using a unique western blotting was established. Immunoaffinity column chromatography using an anti-ginsenoside Rb1MAb has made possible a single-step separation of ginsenoside Rb1 from a crude ginseng extract. Single chain Fv gene of anti-forskolin MAb was prepared from mRNA of hybridoma secreting anti-forskolin MAb and cloned. Gene was constructed into a pET-28a(+) vector producing a scFv protein. Modeling of forskolin and scFV was investigated. THCA synthase was purified from the homogenate of Cannabis sativa leaves on successive column chromatographies. THCA synthase was confirmed to be homogeneity having 75 kDa. To obtain the corresponding cDNA clone of THCA synthase, a set of degenerate promers was constructed based on N-terinal and internal amino acid sequences of THCA synthase. The 5' and 3' ends of cDNA were amplified by RACE. A full sequencing has been determined to be corded a polypeptide having 545 amino acid residues. The cDNA clone was expressed in yeast system via PUC19 vector resulting in THCA synthase activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shoyama", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 6.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Ligases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Affinity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Ligases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacognosy"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "40"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11019648"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
