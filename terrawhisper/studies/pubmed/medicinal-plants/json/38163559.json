However, due to the complexity of the components, the pharmacological mechanism of Bazhen decoction is still limited.", "In this study, with the aim of helping the clinical precision medicine of TCM, we try out a systematic analysis for dissecting the molecular mechanism of complicated TCM prescription: Bazhen decoction. We identify the pharmacological mechanism of Bazhen decoction in telomere elongation as revealed by systematic analysis.", "By RNA sequencing and transcriptome analysis of Bazhen decoction treated wild type cells, we reveal the transcriptome profile induced by Bazhen decoction. We utilized the cells derived from Werner syndrome (WS) mice, which is known to be dysfunctional in telomere elongation due to the deficiency of DNA helicase Wrn. By Western blot, qPCR, Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, telomere FISH, and SA-\u03b2-Gal staining, we verify the transcriptome data and confirm the pharmacological function of Bazhen decoction and its drug containing serum in telomere elongation and reversing progeroid cell senescence.", "We reveal that Bazhen decoction may systematically regulate multiple anti-aging pathways, including stem cell regulation, protein homeostasis, cardiovascular function, neuronal function, anti-inflammation, anti-DNA damage induced stress, DNA helicase activity and telomere lengthening. We find that Bazhen decoction and its drug containing serum could up-regulate multiple DNA helicases and telomere regulating proteins. The increased DNA helicases promote the resolving of G-quadruplex (G4) structures, and facilitate DNA replication and telomere elongation. These improvements also endow the cellular resistance to DNA damages induced by replication stress, and rescue the WS caused cellular senescence.", "Together these data suggest that Bazhen decoction up-regulate the expression of DNA helicases, thus facilitate G4 resolving and telomere maintenance, which rescue the progeroid cellular senescence and contribute to its anti-aging properties. Our data reveal a new molecular mechanism of Bazhen decoction in anti-aging related diseases via elongating telomere, this may shed light in the application of Bazhen decoction in multiple degenerative diseases caused by telomere erosion."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
