(TFP) in streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats. STZ-induced diabetic rats were treated with TFP weekly for 4 weeks at three doses (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg). Blood glucose levels (BGL), body weight, insulin, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), super oxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) levels of liver and pancreas were measured weekly for 4 weeks. STZ administration resulted in oxidative damage of pancreas, then hyperglycemia proved by higher MDA, lower insulin and higher BGL in comparison to normal rats. TC, TG, LDL and VLDL cholesterol levels were also significantly elevated with decreased GSH, SOD, and CAT levels. A steady decrease in BGL and increase in insulin level were observed 4 weeks after TFP treatment in a dose dependent manner, as well as remarkable improvement in body weight and biochemical parameters. TFP have the effect of inhibiting hyperglycemia and oxidative stress, and the administration may be helpful in the prevention of diabetic complications associated with oxidative stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science, Huaihua University, Huaihua, China / Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Study and Utilization of Ethnic Medicinal Plant Resources, Huaihua, China / Key Laboratory of Hunan Higher Education for Hunan-Western Medicinal Plant and Ethnobotany, Huaihua, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shenghua", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science, Huaihua University, Huaihua, China / Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Study and Utilization of Ethnic Medicinal Plant Resources, Huaihua, China / Key Laboratory of Hunan Higher Education for Hunan-Western Medicinal Plant and Ethnobotany, Huaihua, China."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science, Huaihua University, Huaihua, China / Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Study and Utilization of Ethnic Medicinal Plant Resources, Huaihua, China / Key Laboratory of Hunan Higher Education for Hunan-Western Medicinal Plant and Ethnobotany, Huaihua, China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Junying", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science, Huaihua University, Huaihua, China / Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Study and Utilization of Ethnic Medicinal Plant Resources, Huaihua, China / Key Laboratory of Hunan Higher Education for Hunan-Western Medicinal Plant and Ethnobotany, Huaihua, China."}], "LastName": "Xianjin Wu", "ForeName": "Xianjin Wu", "Initials": "XW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science, Huaihua University, Huaihua, China / Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Study and Utilization of Ethnic Medicinal Plant Resources, Huaihua, China / Key Laboratory of Hunan Higher Education for Hunan-Western Medicinal Plant and Ethnobotany, Huaihua, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavones"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pancreas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Potentilla"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28603128"]}}]}
