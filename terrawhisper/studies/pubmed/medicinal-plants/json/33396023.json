The application of this technique has greatly ensured the safety and effectiveness of medicinal materials. In this paper, we review the application of DNA barcoding and some related technologies over the past 10 years with respect to improving our knowledge of medicinal plant identification and authentication. From single locus-based DNA barcodes to combined markers to genome-scale levels, DNA barcodes contribute more and more genetic information. At the same time, other technologies, such as high-resolution melting (HRM), have been combined with DNA barcoding. With the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS), metabarcoding technology has also been shown to identify species in mixed samples successfully. As a widely used and effective tool, DNA barcoding will become more useful over time in the field of medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
