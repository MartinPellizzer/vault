Cytosols or suspensions of K. pneumoniae with or without specific concentrations of diallyl sulphide (DAS) or diallyl disulphide (DADS) as co-treatment showed different percentages of 2-AF acetylation. The data indicated that there was decreased NAT activity associated with increased levels of DAS or DADS in K. pneumoniae. In growth studies on K. pneumoniae it was demonstrated that DAS or DADS elicited a dose-dependent bacteriocide effect on K. pneumoniae. For the cytosol examinations, the apparent values of Km and Vmax were 0.96+/-0.09 mM and 7.87+/-0.79 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein, respectively, for 2-AF. However, when DAS or DADS was added to the reaction mixtures, the apparent values of Km and Vmax were 0.16+/-0.04 mM and 0.99+/-0.16 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein with DAS, respectively, and 0.14+/-0.18 mM and 0.85+/-0.10 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein with DADS, respectively, for 2-AF. For the intact bacteria examination, the apparent values of Km and Vmax were 0.57+/-0.06 mM and 2.00+/-0.14 nmol min(-1) per 10x10(10) CFU, respectively, for 2-AF. However, when DAS or DADS was added to the reaction mixtures, the apparent of values of Km and Vmax were 0.41+/-0.04 mM and 1.30+/-0.10 nmol min(-1) per 10x10(10) CFU with DAS, respectively, and 0.34+/-0.04 mM and 1.08+/-0.08 nmol min(-1) per 10x10(10) CFU with DADS, respectively, for 2-AF. This report is the first demonstration to show that the garlic components DAS and DADS would affect K. pneumoniae growth and NAT activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, China Medical College Hospital, Taiwan, Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "G W", "Initials": "GW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ho", "ForeName": "H C", "Initials": "HC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8109495", "ISSNLinking": "0260-437X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5HI47O6OA7", "NameOfSubstance": "diallyl disulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60G7CF7CWZ", "NameOfSubstance": "allyl sulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9M98QLJ2DL", "NameOfSubstance": "2-Acetylaminofluorene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.1.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "2-Acetylaminofluorene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytosol"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disulfides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Klebsiella pneumoniae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "14"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10215179", "10.1002/(sici)1099-1263(199903/04)19:2<75::aid-jat552>3.0.co;2-p", "10.1002/(SICI)1099-1263(199903/04)19:2<75::AID-JAT552>3.0.CO;2-P"]}}]}
