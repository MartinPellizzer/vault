Some papers have presented that the essential oils of <i>Lamiaceae</i> plants can have antifungal activity. This study aimed to investigate the activity of 7 essential oils of the <i>Lamiaceae</i> family with known phytochemical compositions against <i>Candida</i> fungi.", "Forty-four strains belonging to six species were tested: <i>C. albicans</i>, <i>C. glabrata</i>, <i>C. guilliermondii</i>, <i>C. krusei</i>, <i>C. parapsilosis</i>, and <i>C. tropicalis</i>. During this investigation, the following methods were used: determination of the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), biofilm inhibition studies, and <i>in silico</i>toxicity tests.", "Essential oils of lemon balm (<i>Melissa officinalis</i>) and oregano (<i>Origanum vulgare</i>) showed the best anti-<i>Candida</i> activity, with MIC values below 3.125 mg/mL. Lavender (<i>Lavandula stoechas</i>), mint (<i>Mentha \u00d7 piperita</i>), rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>), and thyme (<i>Thymus vulgaris</i>) essential oils were also very active (0.39 to 6.25 or 12.5 mg/mL). Sage (<i>Salvia officinalis</i>) essential oil presented the lowest activity, with MIC values ranging from 3.125 to 100 mg/mL. In an antibiofilm study using MIC values, oregano and thyme essential oils showed the greatest effect, followed by lavender, mint, and rosemary oils. The weakest antibiofilm activity was observed with the lemon balm and sage oils. <i>In silico</i> toxicity research suggests that most of main compounds of <i>Lamiaceae</i> essential oils probably do not exhibit carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or cytotoxicity.", "The obtained results showed that <i>Lamiaceae</i> essential oils have anti-<i>Candida</i> and antibiofilm activity. Further research is required to confirm the safety and efficacy of essential oils in the topical treatment of candidiasis."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
