The growth rates of cultured cells were identified by plating 5 x 10(5) cells/35 mm culture dish (Day 0) and every 24 hours cell proliferation was determined by quantifying the cell number (using a hemocytometer). The third to seventh passages were used. A medium without serum but supplemented with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was substituted for the original medium at the subconfluent period and cultured for an additional 24 h. The medium was collected and used for assays of protein content and lysyl oxidase activity. Lysyl oxidase activity was assayed with [4,5-3H]--lysine labelled purified chick--embryo aorta elastin substrate. After incubation for 10 h at 37 degrees C, the enzyme activity was measured from 3HHO (tritiated water) separated by ultrafiltration using Amicon C-10 micro-concentrators. The results showed the mean doubling time of OSF fibroblasts was 3.2 days and of NM fibroblasts was 3.6 days. NM fibroblasts became confluent at day 6 as determined by cell number, while OSF fibroblasts were confluent by Day 5. Furthermore, the immunoenzymatic assay for BrdUrd incorporation revealed that OSF fibroblasts proliferate significantly faster than NM fibroblasts under standard culture conditions. Both total protein content (10.84 +/- 1.15 mg/ml) and lysyl oxidase activity (3558.6 +/- 345.5 cpm/10(6) cell) in OSF fibroblasts were greater than in NM fibroblasts (6.35 +/- 0.96 mg/ml and 2436.0 +/- 352.6 cpm/10(6) cell). The results of this study provide evidence that fibroblasts derived from oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) tissue and normal mucosa (NM), although similar in many respects, exhibit specific differences in proliferation rates and lysyl oxidase activity. Moreover, collagen deposition in OSF tissue may, at least in part, be ascribed to increased lysyl oxidase activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillo-Facial Surgery, School of Dentistry Kaohsiung Medical College, Taiwan, ROC."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "R H", "Initials": "RH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shieh", "ForeName": "T Y", "Initials": "TY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "J Oral Pathol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8911934", "ISSNLinking": "0904-2512"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media, Serum-Free"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27432CM55Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Serum Albumin, Bovine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-58-3", "NameOfSubstance": "Elastin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.3.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein-Lysine 6-Oxidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chick Embryo"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media, Serum-Free"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Elastin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoenzyme Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Oral Submucous Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein-Lysine 6-Oxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Serum Albumin, Bovine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8537914", "10.1111/j.1600-0714.1995.tb01210.x"]}}]}
