A neutral polysaccharide (CPP-1) was purified from C. pilosula. The structure was characterized by HPSEC-MALLS-RID, UV, FT-IR, GC-MS, methylation analysis, and NMR. The results showed that CPP-1 was a homogeneous pure polysaccharide, mainly containing fructose and glucose, and a small amount of arabinose. Methylation analysis showed that CPP-1 composed of \u21921)-Fruf-(2\u2192, Fruf-(1\u2192 and Glcp-(1\u2192 residues. Combined the NMR results the structure of CPP-1 was confirmed as \u03b1-D-Glcp-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0[2)-\u03b2-D-Fruf-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a02)-\u03b2-D-Fruf-(1]<sub>26</sub>\u00a0\u2192\u00a02)-\u03b2-D-Fruf with the molecular weight of 4.890\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>3</sup>\u00a0Da. The model of AML12 hepatocyte fat damage was established in vitro. The results showed that CPP-1 could increase the activity of SOD and CAT antioxidant enzymes and reduce the content of MDA, thus protecting cells from oxidative damage. Subsequently, the liver protective effect of CPP-1 was studied in the mouse model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced by the high-fat diet. The results showed that CPP-1 significantly reduced the body weight, liver index, and body fat index of NAFLD mice, and significantly improved liver function. Therefore, CPP-1 should be a potential candidate for the treatment of NAFLD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
