The PubMed, EBSCO, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database were searched for articles published before December 2022. The publication language was restricted to English and Chinese. A meta-analysis was conducted by combining all studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Twenty-two studies (1990 women with GDM and 1597 pregnant women without GDM) were ultimately included in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that the serum vaspin levels are significantly higher in GDM compared with the controls (standardized mean difference: 0.720, 95% confidence interval: 0.440-1.000, <i>Z</i>\u2009=\u20095.041, <i>P</i>\u2009<\u20090.001). Subgroup analyses by stage of pregnancy and body mass index showed results similar to the overall outcome. No publication bias was identified, and the sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the final result. Our results show that the serum vaspin levels are significantly higher in GDM. These findings suggest that high vaspin concentration is closely related to GDM and the serum vaspin levels might be a potential biomarker to indicate risk of GDM, more randomized control trials comparing the expression levels of vaspin between early and standard diagnosis of GDM are needed to strengthen our findings."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Chemical Drug R&D, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0004-4787-2217"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Chemical Drug R&D, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yibu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Chemical Drug R&D, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Yibing", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Chemical Drug R&D, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Xuehui", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Judi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Chemical Drug R&D, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Chemical Drug R&D, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Meta-Analysis", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Metab Syndr Relat Disord", "NlmUniqueID": "101150318", "ISSNLinking": "1540-4196"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Serpins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "SERPINA12 protein, human"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes, Gestational"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Serpins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37883666", "10.1089/met.2023.0089"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
