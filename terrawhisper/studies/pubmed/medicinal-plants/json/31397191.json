In traditional Eastern medicines, nettle has been used as an anti-inflammatory agent to treat rheumatism and osteoarthritis. Fumaric acid (FA) as a major effective compound in nettle was chosen based on very accurate virtual screening to find antagonist for TLR4/MD structure. In this study, the <i>in vitro</i> therapeutic effects of FA on arsenic-exposed monocytes-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) were evaluated. All the canonical functions of dendritic cells in bridging innate and adaptive immune system including phagocytosis and antigen-presenting capacity, and also cytokines secretion, were evaluated after exposure to arsenic/FA. FA profoundly over-expressed antigen-presenting capacity of MDDCs after exposure to arsenic through the upregulation of MHC\u03b9\u03b9. However, phagocytosis capacity of arsenic-exposed MDDCs is not compensated for, by treatment with FA. Arsenic up-regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines independents of TLR4 pathway. FA surprisingly mitigates the up-regulation of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 but not TLR4 and NF-kB. Moreover, FA increases the viability of MDDCs even at a high dose of arsenic. Totally, FA reduced inflammatory factors induced by arsenic. This finding confirmed that nettle and other medicinal plants containing similar structures with FA could be further analyzed as valuable candidates for the reduction of drastic effects of arsenic in human immune systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Plant Breeding and Biotechnology, University of Zabol , Zabol , Iran."}], "LastName": "Heidari", "ForeName": "Forouzan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1913-4837"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Modern Biological Techniques, University of Zanjan , Zanjan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Bahari", "ForeName": "Abbas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Modern Biological Techniques, University of Zanjan , Zanjan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Amarlou", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Plant Breeding and Biotechnology, University of Zabol , Zabol , Iran."}], "LastName": "Fakheri", "ForeName": "Barat Ali", "Initials": "BA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8800150", "ISSNLinking": "0892-3973"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fumarates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toll-Like Receptor 4"}, {"RegistryNumber": "88XHZ13131", "NameOfSubstance": "fumaric acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N712M78A8G", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Adaptive Immunity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Antigen Presentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Arsenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dendritic Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fumarates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Immunity, Innate"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Monocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phagocytosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Toll-Like Receptor 4"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Up-Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31397191", "10.1080/08923973.2019.1645166"]}}]}
