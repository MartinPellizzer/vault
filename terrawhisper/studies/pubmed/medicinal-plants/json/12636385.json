Conjugate additions of variously substituted anilines to alkyl-substituted acetylenic sulfones generally proceeded slowly and in poor yield, especially when the aniline contained an electron-withdrawing substituent such as an ester group. In some cases, the reactions were enhanced by the presence of DMAP and the use of an excess of the sulfone in aqueous DMF. N-Formylanilines proved superior to free anilines. The products were either vinyl or allyl sulfones, depending on the conditions and the structure of the reactants. The acetylenic sulfone exists in equilibrium with its allenic and propargylic isomers under base-catalyzed conditions. Therefore, any of the three unsaturated sulfones can serve as the starting material for the conjugate additions. o-Iodoanilines proved superior to methyl anthranilate derivatives and underwent conjugate additions smoothly. The products were subjected to palladium-catalyzed carbonylation in methanol, and the resulting methyl esters were cyclized by treatment with strong bases such as LiHMDS or LiTMP, followed by reductive desulfonylation with aluminum amalgam. The resulting 2-substituted 4-quinolones included the naturally occurring medicinal compounds 1 and 2 and the O-methyl derivative 3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 1N4. tgback@ucalgary.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Back", "ForeName": "Thomas G", "Initials": "TG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Parvez", "ForeName": "Masood", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wulff", "ForeName": "Jeremy E", "Initials": "JE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Org Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985193R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3263"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinolones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ortho-Aminobenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0YS975XI6W", "NameOfSubstance": "anthranilic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OC7TV75O83", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylene"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Quinolones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ruta"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "ortho-Aminobenzoates"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12636385", "10.1021/jo026595t"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
