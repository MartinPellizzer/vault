In July 2020, a new rhizome rot disease was observed on ginger in Laiwu, Shandong Province, China. The disease symptoms were observed on both above-ground and underground plant parts. The above ground stems and leaves becoming withered and yellow, and water-soaked symptoms were observed on the collar region. The diseased rhizomes were poorly developed with brown lesion and eventually they would rot, without offensive odors. Disease incidence was estimated at approximately 5% across the survey area. To isolate the pathogen, tissues from 30 rhizomes were cut from the border between diseased and healthy tissue, surface sterilized in 75% alcohol for 15 s, soaked in 0.1% mercuric chloride for 1 min, washed with sterile distilled water three times, and plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 25\u00b0C for 2-3 days. Twenty nine fungal isolates with similar morphological characteristics were obtained and pure cultures were obtained using single spore isolation. The colony of AQJ-1, a representative isolate, on PDA was cottony, fluffy, white, and beige coloration on the reverse side at first, and subsequently many black sporangia were produced. The sporangia were black, sub-globose, and 45.2-181.7 \u03bcm (n = 50) in diameter. The sporangiospores were unequal, globose or sub-globose, about 3.2-8.7 \u00d7 4.6-12.3\u03bcm (n = 50) in diameter. For the molecular characterization, genomic DNA was extracted by modified CTAB method (Niu et al., 2008). Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF-1\u03b1) gene were amplified using the primer pairs ITS1/ITS4 (White et al., 1990) and MEF10/MEF4 (Abe et al., 2007), respectively. The ITS and EF-1\u03b1 sequences of isolate AQJ-1 were submitted to GenBank (MN606288 and MN735220, respectively). The BLASTn analysis of the sequences showed 99%-100% similarity to the sequences of <i>R. oryzae</i> strain CBS 120.12 (MH854609, AB281529, respectively). Therefore, based on morphological and molecular characteristics, isolate AQJ-1 was identified as R. oryzae. For pathogenicity tests, thirty ginger seedlings (Laiwu Big Ginger) were grown for 30 days in plastic pots and removed from the pots and the rhizomes washed in running tap water. The rhizomes of fifteen ginger seedlings were attached to a 7 mm agar disk from a plate containing 2-day-old mycelium, and the other fifteen seedlings were attached to agar disk without mycelium as control. Then the inoculated and control seedlings were planted in pots and were kept in separate chambers in a greenhouse at 25\u00b12 \u00b0C. After 14 days, the same symptoms of rhizome rot were observed in all inoculated plants as previously described, and no symptoms were observed on the control plants. The pathogen was re-isolated from symptomatic tissues, and was identified as R. oryzae, which full-filled the Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of <i>R. oryzae</i> causing rhizome rot on ginger in China. This disease may pose a potential threat to ginger production in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 74641, Vegetable Research Institute, Jinan, Shandong Province, China; gaoxuli518@163.com."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Xuli", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Academy for Environmental Planning, Jinan, China; jincuiping2020@126.com."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Cuiping", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 74641, Vegetable Research Institute, Jinan, Shandong, China; happy08day@163.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chaoxia", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 74641, Vegetable Research Institute, Jinan, Shandong, China; zhwh70@126.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Weihua", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 74641, Vegetable Research Institute, Jinan, Shandong, China; qnzb1002@126.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yihong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 74641, Institute of Crop Germplasm Resources, Jinan, Shandong, China; gengyun1@126.com."}], "LastName": "Geng", "ForeName": "Yun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 74641, Vegetable Research Institute, Jinan, Shandong, China; zhangmin@126.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 74641, Vegetable Research Institute, Jinan, China; lytsunshine@126.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yongteng", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["35612582", "10.1094/PDIS-12-21-2630-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
