Analysis in HuH-7 cells with transfected plasmids using a luciferase reporter showed that P. amarus specifically inhibited HBV enhancer I activity. To identify the mechanism of this HBV enhancer I inhibition, liver-enriched cellular transcription factors were co-expressed in HuH-7 cells. The C/EBP alpha and beta, as well as HNF-3 alpha and beta transcription factors, significantly up-regulated the HBV enhancer I activity. In contrast, co-transfection of HNF-I alpha or beta had no effect upon the HBV enhancer I activity. Exposure to P. amarus inhibited C/EBP alpha- and beta-mediated up-regulation of HBV enhancer I activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas HNF-3 alpha- and beta-mediated up-regulation of HBV enhancer I was unaffected. In vitro gel shifts showed that P. amarus inhibited complexing of C/EBP transcription factors to a consensus oligonucleotide sequence, whereas DNA binding of AP-1 and SP-1 transcription factors was unaffected. As P. amarus down-regulates HBV mRNA transcription by a specific mechanism involving interactions between HBV enhancer I and C/EBP transcription factors, purification and further analysis of the active P. amarus component will advance insights into its antiviral activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx 10461, USA."}], "LastName": "Ott", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thyagarajan", "ForeName": "S P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "DK01909", "Acronym": "DK", "Agency": "NIDDK NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "DK41296", "Acronym": "DK", "Agency": "NIDDK NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "DK46952", "Acronym": "DK", "Agency": "NIDDK NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Clin Invest", "NlmUniqueID": "0245331", "ISSNLinking": "0014-2972"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA-Binding Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nuclear Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA-Binding Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enhancer Elements, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatitis B virus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herb-Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nuclear Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Simian virus 40"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9395786", "10.1046/j.1365-2362.1997.2020749.x"]}}]}
