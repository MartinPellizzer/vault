Ker-Gawl, is a medicinal herb with indole alkaloids as an active constituent. In this study, we investigated the anti-angiogenic activity of I. obscura extract and one of its major compounds Ipobscurine-A (IPO-A).", "In vivo angiogenesis was induced by injecting B16F10 melanoma cells intradermally on the shaven ventral skin of C57BL/6 mice. In vitro experiments were conducted using human umbilical vein endothelial cells.", "I. obscura and IPO-A significantly inhibited endothelial cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation in vitro. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced sprouting of endothelial cells from rat aorta ex vivo was also inhibited. A marked decrease in the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the expressions of VEGF, cyclooxygenase-2, and nitric oxide synthase by B16F10 cells were observed after the treatment with the extract or IPO-A. Intraperitoneal administration of the extract significantly inhibited B16F10 melanoma cell line-induced neo-vessel formation in C57BL/6 mice in vivo. Analysis of serum cytokine profile clearly showed that extract significantly reduced the elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor and the most potent angiogenic factor VEGF in animals. Serum NO level was also found to be significantly lowered by the administration of the extract. Anti-angiogenic factors such as TIMP-1 and IL-2 level were elevated in the extract-treated animals.", "These data clearly demonstrate that I. obscura extract and IPO-A inhibit the tumor-specific angiogenesis by downregulating pro-angiogenic factors such as MMP, VEGF, and pro-inflammatory mediators and upregulating anti-angiogenic factors such as IL-2 and TIMP-1."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Amala Cancer Research Centre, Thrissur, Kerala, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hamsa", "ForeName": "T P", "Initials": "TP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuttan", "ForeName": "Girija", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8800150", "ISSNLinking": "0892-3973"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Angiogenesis Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indole Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Angiogenesis Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aorta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Movement"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indole Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ipomoea"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrites"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21058930", "10.3109/08923973.2010.531277"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
