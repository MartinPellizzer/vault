A new strategy based on room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) was suggested to solve this problem by reducing the amount of template in the polymerization recipe. The MIP was synthesized with a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide and RTIL (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) as porogen, in which chlorogenic acid (CGA) was used as template, 4-vinylpyridine (4-VP) as functional monomer, and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) as cross-linker. The influence of polymerization variables, including CGA concentrations, and the ratio of 4-VP to EDMA on imprinting effect were investigated comprehensively. Moreover, the properties involving the column permeability, the number of binding sites, and the polymer morphology of the CGA-MIP monoliths were studied thoroughly. The MIP monolith had an excellent column permeability (1.53\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-13</sup>\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>) and allowed an ultra-fast on-line SPE, which dramatically shortens the separation time (<\u200910\u00a0min) and improves the separation efficiency. At high flow velocity (5.0\u00a0mL\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>), 50\u00a0\u03bcL of the extract from Eucommia ulmoides leaves can be loaded directly on the CGA-MIP monoliths and CGA with high purity can be obtained with a recovery of 89.01\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05%. As a conclusion, the resulting RTIL-induced approach of preparing MIP may be an effective tool in fabricating MIP in a low-cost way.
