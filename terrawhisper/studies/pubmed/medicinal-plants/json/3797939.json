The initial cases of botulism were found in Xinjiang province, where the incidence was highest. Outbreaks have occurred in all of the northern provinces and in some of the southern provinces of China. The toxin found most frequently in the northwest region of China was type A; in north China, type B; and in the northeast, type E. The most frequently offending food was home-made strong-smelling preserved bean curd, which was implicated in 74% of the outbreaks. The complex clinical manifestations of botulism can be grouped into those affecting the eyes, the mouth, the pharynx, and the skeletal muscles. Following the institution of effective methods of prevention and treatment, epidemics of botulism in China have been controlled and the mortality rate reduced from 41% (1950s) to 7.6% (1983)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shih", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chao", "ForeName": "S Y", "Initials": "SY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Rev Infect Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "7905878", "ISSNLinking": "0162-0886"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Botulinum Antitoxin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.69", "NameOfSubstance": "Botulinum Toxins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Botulinum Antitoxin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Botulinum Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "mortality", "physiopathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Botulism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Eye"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neutralization Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pharynx"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3797939"]}}]}
