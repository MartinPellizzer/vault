Avelar plants resist systemic infection by the Florida isolate of pepper mottle potyvirus (PepMoV-FL). Immuno-tissue blot analysis for detection of PepMoV-FL infection in selected stem segments revealed that virus moved down the stem in external phloem, and, over time, accumulated to detectable levels throughout stem sections (appearing to accumulate in external and internal phloem) taken from below the inoculated leaf. At 21 days post-inoculation, PepMoV-FL was detected in stem segments one or two internodes above the inoculated leaf; however, no virus was observed in internal phloem in stem segments beyond these internodes. In contrast to these observations, PepMoV-FL was detected in the internal phloem of all internodes of the stem located above the inoculated leaf, with subsequent movement into non-inoculated leaves, in Avelar plants co-infected with PepMoV-FL and cucumber mosaic cucumovirus (CMV-KM). No apparent enhancement of PepMoV-FL accumulation occurred in protoplasts inoculated with PepMoV-FL alone versus a mixed inoculum of PepMoV-FL and CMV-KM. These findings confirm earlier observations that potyvirus movement up the stem of Capsicum species occurs via internal phloem. It is also shown that PepMoV-FL does not accumulate to detectable levels in internal phloem in the stem of Avelar plants, thereby limiting its movement to within the inoculated leaf and lower portions of the stem; however, co-infection of Avelar plants with CMV-KM alleviates this restricted movement, allowing PepMoV-FL to invade young tissues systemically."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, 209 Life Science Building, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA1."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guerini", "ForeName": "Michael N", "Initials": "MN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, 209 Life Science Building, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA1."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murphy", "ForeName": "John F", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Gen Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "0077340", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1317"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cucumovirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Potyvirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Protoplasts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10573176", "10.1099/0022-1317-80-10-2785"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
