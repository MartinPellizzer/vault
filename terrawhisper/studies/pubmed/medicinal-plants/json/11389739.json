A cDNA encoding BAS was for the first time cloned and sequenced from rhubarb (Rheum palmatum), a medicinal plant rich in phenylbutanoids including pharmaceutically important phenylbutanone glucoside, lindleyin. The cDNA encoded a 42-kDa protein that shares 60-75% amino-acid sequence identity with other members of the CHS-superfamily enzymes. Interestingly, R. palmatum BAS lacks the active-site Phe215 residue (numbering in CHS) which has been proposed to help orient substrates and intermediates during the sequential condensation of 4-coumaroyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA in CHS. On the other hand, the catalytic cysteine-histidine dyad (Cys164-His303) in CHS is well conserved in BAS. A recombinant enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli efficiently afforded benzalacetone as a single product from 4-coumaroyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. Further, in contrast with CHS that showed broad substrate specificity toward aliphatic CoA esters, BAS did not accept hexanoyl-CoA, isobutyryl-CoA, isovaleryl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA as a substrate. Finally, besides the phenylbutanones in rhubarb, BAS has been proposed to play a crucial role for the construction of the C6-C4 moiety of a variety of natural products such as medicinally important gingerols in ginger plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Shizuoka, Shizuoka, Japan. abei@ys7.u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abe", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morita", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Noguchi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["AF326911"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0107600", "ISSNLinking": "0014-2956"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Butanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Multienzyme Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Butanones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Multienzyme Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rheum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11389739", "10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02255.x", "ejb2255"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
