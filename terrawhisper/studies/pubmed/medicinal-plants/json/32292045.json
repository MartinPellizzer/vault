Other beneficial health effects, such as fat reduction, glucose metabolism, and hepatoprotection, have also been reported in recent studies. This review briefly discusses the absorption and metabolism of vitexin, as well as its influence on gut microbiota. Recent advances in understanding the pharmacological and biological effects of vitexin are then reviewed. Improved knowledge of the absorption, metabolism, bioactivity, and molecular targets of vitexin is crucial for the better utilization of this emerging nutraceutical as a chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food and Biological Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Urban Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Gan", "ForeName": "Renyou", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2332-8554"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Food, Nutrition and Health, Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Huabin", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Art, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Mingxuan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst , Massachusetts, USA."}], "LastName": "McClements", "ForeName": "David Julian", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5742-5446"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food and Biological Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Ruichang", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9171-269X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food and Biological Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Quancai", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7V515PI7F6", "NameOfSubstance": "Apigenin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9VP70K75OK", "NameOfSubstance": "vitexin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Apigenin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32292045", "10.1080/10408398.2020.1753165"]}}]}
