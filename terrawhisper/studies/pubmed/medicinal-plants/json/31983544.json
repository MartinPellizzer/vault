PCL assay was used to determine the antioxidant activity.", "Results showed that methanol and acetone extracts exhibited a significant antioxidant activity (261.41 and 272.90\u03bcmol TE/g respectively), while the lowest one was observed in the case of marrubiin and essential oil. The antifungal activity of different extracts, marrubiin and essential oil at two concentrations (20 and 100\u03bcg/mL) were screened against the dermatophytes fungi Microsporum gypseum, Microsporum canis, Arthroderma cajetani, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton tonsurans, Epidermophyton floccosum and against two fungi strains (Botrytis cinerea, Pythium ultimum). Among tested extracts, marrubiin at 100\u03bcg/mL showed about 50% inhibition for T.\u00a0mentagrophytes and E.\u00a0floccosum. The anti-phytopathogenic activity was also carried out, only marrubiin had in activity against B.\u00a0cinerea at the highest dose (32.40%), while methanol extract of M.vulgare and marrubiin are able to increase the mycelial growth of P.\u00a0ultimum at the highest concentration (45.15 and 40.30% respectively).", "In our study, we conclude that M.vulgare and marrubiin can be used as natural antioxidants and antifungal agent for treatment of skin dermatophyte infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.
