Treatment by reducing food intake and physical activity interventions has limited success especially with elderly people with chronic diseases. Nutraceuticals are naturally originated and successfully used for their physiological and nutritional benefit in health care. They might be alternative means to help lose weight and reduce obesity-associated metabolic disorders with the improvement of health, delay the aging process, prevention of chronic diseases, increase of life expectancy, or support to the structure or function of the body. The current study enumerates the inherent role of nutraceuticals in the management of obesity and its related comorbidities. The study is supported with the molecular docking studies discussing the mechanism of action. An attempt to optimize the role of nutraceuticals is made in this article in addition to widen the scope of its use in this chronic worldwide disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7445-963X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain-Shams University, Cairo, Egypt."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Drug Discovery Research and Development, Ain-Shams University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Singab", "ForeName": "Abdel Nasser B", "Initials": "ANB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain-Shams University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Elhawary", "ForeName": "Esraa A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Pharmacy, Future University in Egypt, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Elkhawas", "ForeName": "Yasmin A", "Initials": "YA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Future University in Egypt, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Fawzy", "ForeName": "Iten M", "Initials": "IM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7818-3319"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain-Shams University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Moussa", "ForeName": "Ashaimaa Y", "Initials": "AY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain-Shams University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mostafa", "ForeName": "Nada M", "Initials": "NM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38324003", "10.1089/jmf.2023.0104"]}}]}
