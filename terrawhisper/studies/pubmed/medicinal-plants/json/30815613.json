The treatment and prophylaxis of the patients suffering from this infection require the identification of new anti-<i>Candida</i> agents with no side effects or toxicity like medicinal plants. The present study was conducted to compare the antifungal activities of the aqueous, ethanolic, and methanolic extracts of the bark and roots of <i>P. granatum</i> with those of two routine antifungal agents (i.e., fluconazole and nystatin) on oral <i>Candida</i> strains isolated from liver transplant recipients.", "Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the ethanolic, methanolic, and aqueous extracts of the bark and root of <i>Punica granatum</i> against <i>C. albicans</i> and <i>C. glabrata</i> isolated from oral cavities were evaluated according to the CLSI M27-A3. All data were analyzed in SPSS (version 16.0) by pairwise comparison and Kruskal-Wallis test.", "The MIC50 and MIC90 values for the methanolic and ethanolic extracts of the bark and root of <i>P. granatum</i> against <i>C. albicans</i> were both obtained as 0.05 mg/ml with the geometric mean (GM) of 0.07. Furthermore, the MIC90 values for the aqueous extracts of bark and root were estimated as 0.05 and 0.2 mg/ml, respectively. With regard to <i>C. glabrata,</i> the MIC50 and MIC90 values for the methanolic and ethanolic extracts of the bark and root were 0.05 mg/ml. However, the MIC90 value for the aqueous extract against this species was obtained as 25 mg/ml. The GM values for the aqueous extracts of the bark and root were 9.49 and 0.32, respectively.", "As the findings indicated, the methanolic and ethanolic extracts of the bark and root of <i>Punica granatum</i> had anti-<i>Candida</i> activities. Therefore, they can be considered as mouthwash or toothpaste to prevent and treat <i>Candida</i> infections in the oral cavity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Medicine, Oral and Dental Disease Research Center, School of Dentistry, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Lavaee", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, School of Dentistry, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Motaghi", "ForeName": "Darya", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Natural Products Chemistry Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jassbi", "ForeName": "Amir Reza", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jafarian", "ForeName": "Hadis", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghasemi", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Badiee", "ForeName": "Parisa", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Mycol", "NlmUniqueID": "101647935", "ISSNLinking": "2423-3420"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Akpan A, Morgan R.
