Unfortunately, due to the failure of most of drugs in clinical trials recently, attentions have moved towards the traditional system of medicines including Ayurveda. In Ayurveda, Sameerpannag Ras (SR) is a mineral and metallic origin based formulation which has been used for the treatment of arthritis and chronic systematic inflammatory disorder. The current study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of Sameerpannag Ras Mixture (SRM), on the neurobehavioral dysfunction and associated neuroinflammation, induced by transient Internal Carotid Artery Occlusion (ICAO) in mice model.", "In the present study, mice were treated with Sameerpannag Ras Mixture (SRM) at the dose of 40mg/kg body weight by oral gavages for 3 and 7days respectively, twice a day, after the induction of ICAO for 90min followed by reperfusion. The efficacy of SRM was examined by scoring neurological behavioral deficit using the standard neurological deficit score (NDS), grip strength and rotarod performance tests at different time intervals of post-ICAO.", "Post-ischemic treatment with Sameerpannag Ras Mixture (SRM) at 40mg/kg significantly reduced Neurological Deficit Score and improved the motor coordination at different time intervals post-ICAO. The analysis of RT-qPCR data showed that transient cerebral ischemia could induce the inflammatory response genes in the affected striatal region of ICAO group, as compared to sham group, on day3 and day7 post-ICAO. Interestingly, SRM treatment showed marked improvement in the ischemia-induced neurobehavioral deficits by attenuating ischemia-induced neuroinflammatory response at both gene and protein level.", "The present study suggests that Sameerpannag Ras Mixture (SRM) treatment ameliorates behavioral outcomes after mild ischemia through the suppression of a number of inflammatory response genes involved in neuronal damage. This is the first report of the molecular mechanism underlying the significant neuroprotective action of the Ayurvedic drug, Sameerpannag Ras Mixture (SRM), using a mild stroke in mice model."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
