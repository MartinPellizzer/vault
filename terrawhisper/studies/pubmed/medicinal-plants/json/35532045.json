Here, a multifaceted strategy was proposed to analyze and identify the composition of HuangLian JieDu Decoction based on offline two-dimensional liquid chromatography combined with ultraviolet detection and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Multiple components were separated by two-dimensional liquid chromatography, which consisted of hydrophilic interaction chromatography and reversed-phase liquid chromatography, and then further characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry with a full mass spectrometry/precursor ion list/data-dependent secondary scan data acquisition method. For data processing, database screening and molecular networking were used to identify the components in HuangLian JieDu Decoction. The offline two-dimensional liquid chromatography combined with ultraviolet detection and a high-resolution mass spectrometry system showed good orthogonality of 76.35% and a high peak capacity of 5175, effectively separating multiple components. Finally, 527 compounds, including 164 alkaloids, 133 terpenoids, 88 flavonoids, 60 phenylpropanoids, 38 organic acids, and 44 other compounds, were characterized. This integrated approach is suitable for the comprehensive characterization of herbal medicines and other complex chemical systems."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology and Drug Evaluation, Ministry of Education, Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Drug Delivery System and Biotech Drugs in Universities of Shandong, Yantai University, Yantai, P.
