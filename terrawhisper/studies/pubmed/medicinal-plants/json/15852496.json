Leukotrienes are considered as potent mediators of inflammatory and allergic reactions and regarding their pro-inflammatory properties the inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase pathway is considered to be interesting in the treatment of a variety of inflammatory diseases. Besides 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, drugs able to block the 5-lipoxygenase as well as the cyclooxygenase metabolic pathway are also of therapeutic value. A potential source for new 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors is undoubtedly provided by the abundance of medicinal plants used in traditional medicine. The present review article reports the results from a comprehensive literature search of plants that have been tested for 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory activity over the past 15 years. The obtained information is summarized in a tabular format and promising plant species and chemical classes of compounds are presented. Relevant in vitro tests are also described in this article."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Pharmacognosy, Karl-Franzens-University, Graz, Austria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schneider", "ForeName": "Isabella", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bucar", "ForeName": "Franz", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "140"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15852496", "10.1002/ptr.1603"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
