Characteristic antigens of TR were separated from TR extract using rabbit antiserum specific for TR, a dried root tuber of Trichosanthes kirilowii. Two selected antibody enzyme immunoassay (SAEIA) methods, the SAEIA A for assay of TR extract and the SAEIA B for assay of karasurin A were used as detection methods for the separation of TR antigens. Using several column chromatographies, two kinds of TR antigens, a protein component and a glycan component, were separated from TR extract. A SAEIA C method for assay of TR glycan component was developed using biotinylated second antibody and peroxidase-labeled avidin as the detection method. The SAEIA C was also found applicable for specific assay of TR extract as well as for the contents of TR component present in two Chinese traditional medicines, prescriptions of which contained TR. Content of trichosantin, an abortifacient protein component of T. kirilowii, in both the medicines were also measured by applying the SAEIA B for assay of karasurin A. Little trichosantin was found in either medicine and the reason for this was determined."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kitagawa", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fujiwara", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Akahori", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sonoi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kondo", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60318-52-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Trichosanthin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Agarose"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoenzyme Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trichosanthin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8799473", "10.1248/bpb.19.783"]}}]}
