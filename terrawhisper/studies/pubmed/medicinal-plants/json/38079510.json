In this study, we investigate photosynthetic gas exchange, photosystem II (PSII) performance, nitrogen absorption and accumulation in a medicinal plant wolfberry (Lycium chinense) in saline soil supplemented with Trichoderma biofertilizer (TF). Larger nitrogen and biomass accumulation were found in plants supplemented with TF than with organic fertilizer (OF), suggesting that Trichoderma asperellum promoted plant growth and nitrogen accumulation under saline stress. T. asperellum strengthened root nitrogen (N) absorption according to greater increased root NH4+ and NO3- influxes under supplement with TF than OF, while nitrogen assimilative enzymes such as nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase and glutamine synthetase activities in roots and leaves were also stimulated. Thus, the elevated N accumulation derived from the induction of T. asperellum on nitrogen absorption and assimilation. Greater increased photosynthetic rate (Pn) and photosynthetic N-use efficiency under supplement with TF than OF illustrated that T. asperellum enhanced photosynthetic capacity and N utilization under saline stress. Although increased leaf stomatal conductance contributed to carbon (C) isotope fractionation under TF supplement, leaf 13C abundance was significantly increased by supplement with TF rather than OF, indicating that T. asperellum raised CO2 assimilation to a greater extent, reducing C isotope preference. Trichoderma asperellum optimized electron transport at PSII donor and acceptor sides under saline stress because of lower K and J steps in chlorophyll fluorescence transients under supplement with TF than OF. The amount of PSII active reaction centers was also increased by T. asperellum. Thus, PSII performance was upgraded, consistent with greater heightened delayed chlorophyll fluorescence transients and I1 peak under supplement with TF than OF. In summary, TF acted to increase N nutrient acquisition and photosynthetic C fixation resulting in enhanced wolfberry growth under saline soil stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.
