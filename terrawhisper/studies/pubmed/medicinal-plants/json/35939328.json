Herein, an effective linoleic acid (LA) and glucosamine (GlcN) hybrid (LA-GlcN) was synthesized for the treatment of HGSOC. The GlcN was introduced to recognize the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT 1) overexpressed in tumor cells to enhance the uptake of LA-GlcN, and the unsaturated LA was employed to trigger ferroptosis by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Since the iron content of HGSOC was \u223c5 and 2 times, respectively, higher than that of the normal ovarian cells and low-grade serous ovarian cancer cells, these excess irons make them a good target to enhance the ferroptosis of LA-GlcN. The in vitro study demonstrated that LA-GlcN could selectively kill HGSOC cells without affecting normal cells; the in vivo study revealed that LA-GlcN at the dose of 50 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> achieved a comparable tumor inhibition as doxorubicin hydrochloride (4 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) while the overall survival of mice was extended largely due to the low toxicity, and when the dose was increased to 100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, the therapeutic outcomes could be improved further. This dietary hybrid which targets the excess endogenous iron to activate ferroptosis represents a promising drug for HGSOC treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & College of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, University Town, Guian New District, Guiyang 550025, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biomedical Engineering and National Engineering Research Center for Biomaterials, Sichuan University, 29 Wangjiang Road, Chengdu 610064, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biomedical Engineering and National Engineering Research Center for Biomaterials, Sichuan University, 29 Wangjiang Road, Chengdu 610064, China."}], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Xiaoming", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, The Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan Province 646000, China."}], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "Pei", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biomedical Engineering and National Engineering Research Center for Biomaterials, Sichuan University, 29 Wangjiang Road, Chengdu 610064, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Liangkui", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & College of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, University Town, Guian New District, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Zengqiu", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8210-7121"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biomedical Engineering and National Engineering Research Center for Biomaterials, Sichuan University, 29 Wangjiang Road, Chengdu 610064, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Yongchao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biomedical Engineering and National Engineering Research Center for Biomaterials, Sichuan University, 29 Wangjiang Road, Chengdu 610064, China."}], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Chunyan", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7633-358X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biomedical Engineering and National Engineering Research Center for Biomaterials, Sichuan University, 29 Wangjiang Road, Chengdu 610064, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shiyong", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "101197791", "ISSNLinking": "1543-8384"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9KJL21T0QJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Linoleic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N08U5BOQ1K", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ferroptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucosamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Linoleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Ovarian Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35939328", "10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.2c00333"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
