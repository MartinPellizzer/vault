Meyer, was studied. Methylation analysis indicated that GL-BIII consisted mainly of terminal Arap, 4- or 5-substituted Ara, 2,4-disubstituted Rha, 4- and 6-substituted Gal, and 3,6-disubstituted Gal. Single radial gel diffusion using beta-glucosyl-Yariv antigen indicated that GL-BIII contained a small proportion of a beta-(1-->3,6)-galactan moiety. GL-BIII also contained terminal, 4-substituted, and 3,4-disubstituted GalA, and terminal and 4-substituted GlcA. Base-catalysed beta-elimination suggested that some 2-substituted Rha in GL-BIII was attached to position 4 of a 4-substituted uronic acid. Both mild acid hydrolysis and endo-alpha-(1-->4)-polygalacturonase digestion of GL-BIII did not give fragments consisting mainly of GalA. Methylation analysis and GC-MS analysis of acidic oligosaccharides liberated by partial acid hydrolysis indicated that GL-BIII contained a GalA-(1-->4)-Rha unit in addition to longer acidic units consisting of 2-substituted Rha and 4-substituted GalA. Lithium-mediated degradation of GL-BIII followed by borohydride reduction gave small amounts of fractions containing long and intermediate neutral oligosaccharide-alditols and a large amount of a fraction containing short oligosaccharide-alditols. The long neutral oligosaccharide-alditol fraction mainly comprised 4- or 5-substituted Ara, terminal Galf, 6-substituted Glc, and 2-substituted Man, whereas the intermediate oligosaccharide-alditol fraction consisted mainly of terminal and 6-substituted Galp, 6-substituted Glc, and 2-substituted Man. Methylation analysis and GC-MS analysis of the short oligosaccharide-alditol fraction suggested that it contained at least 14 kinds of di- to tetra-saccharide-alditols such as Gal-(1-->2)-Rha-ol, Gal-(1-->4)-Rha-ol, Ara-->Ara-ol, and Ara-->Ara-->Ara-ol."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oriental Medicine Research Center of the Kitasato Institute, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kiyohara", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hirano", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "X G", "Initials": "XG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsumoto", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "X B", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Carbohydr Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0043535", "ISSNLinking": "0008-6215"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "polysaccharide GL-BIII"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7982233", "10.1016/0008-6215(94)00151-0", "0008-6215(94)00151-0"]}}]}
