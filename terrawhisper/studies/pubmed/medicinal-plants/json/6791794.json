The specific activity of soluble enzyme after partial EDTA-promoted inactivation is a linear function of the nickel content. The results are consistent with the presence of 2.0 nickel ions per 97 000-dalton subunit in pure urease. The time scale for loss of enzymatic activity and nickel under these conditions is similar to that for loss of the \"abnormal\" tail absorption in the ultraviolet and visible absorption spectrum of urease (including the shoulder at approximately 420 nm). This indicates that nickel in urease is essential for enzymatic activity and establishes that the metal ions are in part responsible for the tail absorption in the ultraviolet spectrum of urease. After partial inactivation in the presence of EDTA either at low pH or in 2.5 M guanidinium chloride at neutral pH, urease did not regain activity in the presence of Ni2+. As yet apourease has not been produced reversibly. Jack bean seeds grown hydroponically without added nickel were low in both urease activity and nickel (10 and 6%, respectively, of parent seeds). Several other metal ions were readily available. This result suggests that metal ions other than nickel cannot substitute for nickel in the formation of normally active urease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dixon", "ForeName": "N E", "Initials": "NE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gazzola", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Asher", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "D S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Blakeley", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zerner", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0421034", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4018"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Guanidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oximes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2971MFT1KY", "NameOfSubstance": "dimethylglyoxime"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7OV03QG267", "NameOfSubstance": "Nickel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8W8T17847W", "NameOfSubstance": "Urea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9G34HU7RV0", "NameOfSubstance": "Edetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.5.1.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Urease"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JU58VJ6Y3B", "NameOfSubstance": "Guanidine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K324J5K4HM", "NameOfSubstance": "Diacetyl"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diacetyl"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Edetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guanidine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Guanidines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nickel"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oximes"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Urea"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Urease"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6791794", "10.1139/o80-063"]}}]}
