Due to their hydrophobic lipid bilayer and aqueous hydrophilic core structure, they are considered a possible alternative to liposome drug delivery systems. Not only do they protect the cargo like liposomes during delivery, but they are also less toxic and better tolerated. However, due to the lack of sources and methods for obtaining enough exosomes, the therapeutic application of exosomes as drug carriers is limited.", "A literature search was performed using the ScienceDirect and PubMed electronic databases to obtain information from published literature on milk exosomes related to drug delivery.", "Here, we briefly reviewed the current knowledge of exosomes, expounded the advantages of milk-derived exosomes over other delivery vectors, including higher yield, the oral delivery characteristic and additional therapeutic benefits. The purification and drug loading methods of milk exosomes, and the current application of milk exosomes were also introduced.", "The emergence of milk-derived exosomes is expected to break through the limitations of exosomes as therapeutic carriers of drugs.
