The maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of PF were 9.9 and 20.3, and those of PM-I were 16.5 and 101.7 ng/ml at each dose, respectively. The times to Cmax (tmax) of PF were 11.6 and 13.3, and those of PM-I were 60 and 80 min, respectively. The AUC(0-180) of PM-I were 1873 and 12358, and those of PF were 300 and 1174 ng min/ml, respectively. On the other hand, after intravenous administration of PM-I to rats at doses of 0.2 and 2 mg/kg (equal in molar ratio to 0.5 and 5 mg/kg PF), the plasma concentration of PM-I decreased rapidly and the plasma concentration-time curve profile of it fitted well with the two-compartment model at each dose, with terminal half lives (t1/2) of 90.9 and 90.6 min. The Vdss values were 0.91 and 3.79 l/kg, the CLtot values were 8.7 and 39.9 ml/min kg, and the AUC(0-180) values were 5614.1 and 13176.0 ng min/ml, at each dose, respectively. The significant increase in Vdss and CLtot with increasing doses suggested dose-dependent pharmacokinetics. When PM-I was given orally at the same doses, the following parameters were shown: Cmax of 102.2 and 285 ng/ml at tmax 6.2 and 7.5 min and AUCs of 4145.6 and 14182.1 ng min/ml, at each dose. The bioavailability (F) values were 0.8 and 1.07, respectively. These findings indicated that the high percentage of PM-I transformed by intestinal bacteria was rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and a significantly high concentration of PM-I, rather than PF, was present in the plasma after oral administration of PF."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Wakan-Yaku (Traditional Sino-Japanese Medicines), Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Sugitani, Japan."}], "LastName": "Heikal", "ForeName": "O A", "Initials": "OA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Akao", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Takeda", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hattori", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bridged-Ring Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "21AIQ4EV64", "NameOfSubstance": "peoniflorin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "99624-67-6", "NameOfSubstance": "paeonimetabolin I"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzoates"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bridged-Ring Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9178932", "10.1248/bpb.20.517"]}}]}
