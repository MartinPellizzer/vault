TJ-19 was administered by a single oral dose (3 g/kg) or by multiple oral doses (0.75 g/kg).", "The decrease in partial oxygen pressure of arterial blood (Pao(2)) and the increase in airway vascular permeability induced by the oleic acid injection were attenuated by a single dose of TJ-19. When TJ-19 was administered orally twice a day for two weeks and then oleic acid was injected, a potent prophylactic effect of the drug was observed. TJ-19 also prevented airway vascular hyperpermeability, lung cell injury, oxidative stress and thromboxane A(2) generation, associated with the oleic acid injection.", "TJ-19 significantly attenuated the oleic acid-induced lung injury probably through the antioxidative effect and inhibitory effect of thromboxane A(2) generation, although the precise inhibitory mechanisms were not fully elucidated due to the diversity in constituents of the herbal medicine. We suggest that TJ-19 is a promising drug candidate and a medicinal resource for preventing ARDS/ALI."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Yanbian University, Yanji, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chang-Qing", "Initials": "CQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ishitsuka", "ForeName": "Yoichi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moriuchi", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Golbidi", "ForeName": "Saeid", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Zhen-Ji", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Irikura", "ForeName": "Mitsuru", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Irie", "ForeName": "Tetsumi", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "sho-seiryu-to"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2UMI9U37CP", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57576-52-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thromboxane A2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Acute Lung Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Capillary Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Thromboxane A2"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19589235", "10.1211/jpp/61.07.0012"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
