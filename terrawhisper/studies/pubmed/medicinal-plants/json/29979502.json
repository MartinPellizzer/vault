It has become one of hot fields in the study of endophytes and plant, which would affect plant \u2019s metabolite composition. This would provide opportunity for appraising and modifying traits to medicinal plant, and would also perfect the tranditional standpoint on forming reason of medicinal plant genuineness. Here we provide a review of theory and mechanism, research and application of interaction between plant and endophyte. This review may enhance understanding of medicinal plant, and evaluating the quality of herbs in production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Jin-long", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Shun-xing", "Initials": "SX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Pei-gen", "Initials": "PG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29979502"]}}]}
