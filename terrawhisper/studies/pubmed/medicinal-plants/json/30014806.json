The intracellular oxidative stress was investigated through DCFH-DA assay. The molecular docking study was carried out in molecular operating environment (MOE).", "Compound B3 and B5 showed enhanced anti-cancer activity compared with BBR, the IC50 for compound B3 and B5 were significantly lower than BBR, and compound B3 at the concentration of 64 or 128 \u00b5M induced apoptosis in HeLa and A549 cell lines. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) was generated in both cell lines when treated with 100 \u00b5M of all the compounds, and compound B3 and B5 induced higher activity in the generation of ROS, while compound B3 exhibited the highest activity, these results are in accordance with the cytotoxicity results, indicating the cytotoxicity were mostly generated from the oxidative stress. In addition, molecular docking analysis showed that compound B3 had the greatest affinity with Hsp90. Upon binding, the protective function of Hsp90 was lost, which might explain its higher cytotoxicity from molecular interaction aspect.", "All the results demonstrated that compound B3 and B5 showed significantly higher anti-cancer ability than BBR, and compound B3 is a promising anticancer drug candidate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Central South University, 410083, Hunan Province, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Daipeng", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Central South University, 410083, Hunan Province, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Fen", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, 410208, Hunan Province, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Dongming", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, 410208, Hunan Province, China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, 410208, Hunan Province, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Junying", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Central South University, 410083, Hunan Province, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Pan", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Central South University, 410083, Hunan Province, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yanfei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Xiangya School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Central South University, Changsha, 410013, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhenbao", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101265649", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0I8Y3P32UF", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3QD5KJZ7ZJ", "NameOfSubstance": "pyrazole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "A549 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrazoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30014806", "10.2174/1871520618666180717121208", "ACAMC-EPUB-91758"]}}]}
