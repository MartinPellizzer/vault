The lowest determination concentrations of loganin and morroniside were 0.10 and 0.16 mg.L-1, respectively. The recoveries and relative standard deviations of loganin were 99.6% (2.0%), 102.0% (1.0%), 87.9% (7.2%), and those of morroniside were 99.2% (2.5%), 104.1% (1.2%), 92.7% (4.2%), respectively. The relative standard deviations of within-day and between-day precision for the method were all less than 6.8%. After a single intravenous administration of Cornus officinalis injection to mice, the mean plasma concentration-time courses were found to fit a two-compartment open model, the main pharmacokinetic parameters of loganin were as follows: T1/2(alpha), T1/2(beta), K21, K12, K10, V(c), AUC, CL were 3.2 min, 25.1 min, 5.997 h-1, 4.981 h-1, 3.564 h-1, 0.551 L.kg-1, 13.59 mg.L-1.h, 1.965 L.kg-1.h-1, respectively and those of morroniside were 3.6 min, 21.5 min, 5.926 h-1, 3.833 h-1, 3.797 h-1, 0.647 L.kg-1, 27.15 mg.L-1.h, 2.457 L.kg-1.h-1, respectively.", "It is the first time to establish the revered-phase HPLC method to determine concentrations of loganin and morroniside in plasma and to obtain their pharmacokinetic parameters and characteristics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050017, Hebei, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lan-tong", "Initials": "LT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Lei-ming", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wun", "ForeName": "Jin-kun", "Initials": "JK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H7WJ16Q93C", "NameOfSubstance": "loganin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Area Under Curve"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cornus"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Iridoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15015327"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
