This family of molecules are the largest known cyclic peptides, and thus, the mechanism of synthesis and folding is of great interest. To provide information about both these phenomena, we have synthesized kalata B1 using two distinct strategies. In the first, oxidation of the cysteine residues of a linear precursor peptide to form the correct disulfide bonds results in folding of the three-dimensional structure and preorganization of the termini in close proximity for subsequent cyclization. The second approach involved cyclization prior to oxidation. In the first method, the correctly folded peptide was produced only in the presence of partially hydrophobic solvent conditions. These conditions are presumably required to stabilize the surface-exposed hydrophobic residues. However, in the synthesis involving cyclization prior to oxidation, the cyclic reduced peptide folded to a significant degree in the absence of hydrophobic solvents and even more efficiently in the presence of hydrophobic solvents. Cyclization clearly has a major effect on the folding pathway and facilitates formation of the correctly disulfide-bonded form in aqueous solution. In addition to facilitating folding to a compact stable structure, cyclization has an important effect on biological activity as assessed by hemolytic activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Drug Design and Development, University of Queensland, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Daly", "ForeName": "N L", "Initials": "NL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Love", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alewood", "ForeName": "P F", "Initials": "PF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Craik", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0370623", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2960"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclotides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides, Cyclic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Precursors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "kalata B1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "48TCX9A1VT", "NameOfSubstance": "Cystine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Circular Dichroism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclotides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cystine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides, Cyclic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Folding"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Precursors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10441158", "10.1021/bi990605b", "bi990605b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
