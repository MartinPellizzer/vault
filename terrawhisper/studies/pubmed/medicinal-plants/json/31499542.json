The present study, for the first time, evaluated the cytotoxic impacts of <i>Ferula latisecta</i> (<i>F. latisecta</i>) hydroalcoholic extract on U87 GBM cell line. The MTT assay measured the cellular toxicity following 24- and 48\u2009h treatment with various doses of <i>F. latisecta</i> (0-800\u2009\u03bcg/mL). Apoptosis was evaluated by an Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining 24\u2009h after treatment by <i>F. latisecta</i>. Moreover, to determine the cellular metastasis of U87 cells, we used a gelatin zymography assay (matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-2/-9 enzymatic activity). The outcomes showed that <i>F. latisecta</i> mitigated the viability of U87 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 145.3 and 192.3\u2009\u03bcg/mL obtained for 24- and 48\u2009h treatments, respectively. <i>F. latisecta</i> induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner after 24\u2009h. Also, MMP-9 activity was significantly decreased following 24\u2009h after treatment concentration-dependently with no change in MMP-2 enzymatic activity. This study showed that <i>F. latisecta</i> induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis, and mitigated metastasis of U87 GBM cells. Hence, <i>F. latisecta</i> could be beneficial as a promising natural herb against GBM after further studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jalili-Nik", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sabri", "ForeName": "Hamed", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zamiri", "ForeName": "Ehsan", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soukhtanloo", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Roshan", "ForeName": "Mostafa Karimi", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Azar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vahedi", "ForeName": "Mohammad Mahdi", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Afshari", "ForeName": "Amir R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Toxicology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mousavi", "ForeName": "Seyed Hadi", "Initials": "SH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Drug Res (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101602406", "ISSNLinking": "2194-9379"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.35", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferula"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Glioblastoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glioma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9"}], "CoiStatement": "No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31499542", "10.1055/a-0986-6543"]}}]}
