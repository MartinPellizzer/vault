The HPLC column was a reversed-phase microBondapack C18 column, the mobile phase was water: methanol:acetonitrile (49:49:2), and the flow rate was 1.5 mL/min. Khellin and visnagin were detected and analyzed with a spectrophotometer set at 250 nm. Results of the HPLC analysis indicate a relative standard deviation of less than 0.04%. The analytical procedure was used for the quantification of khellin in various pharmaceutical dosage forms, such as ampules, tablets, and suppositories, with relative standard deviations of 1.2, 1.4, and 1.7%, respectively. As little as 10 ng of khellin or visnagin could be detected accurately in less than 13 min."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "el-Domiaty", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "2985195R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3549"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "5G117T0TJZ", "NameOfSubstance": "Khellin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P64438MLBW", "NameOfSubstance": "visnagin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Khellin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1403684", "10.1002/jps.2600810518", "S0022-3549(15)48818-5"]}}]}
