Dianthraquinone glucosides are the main bioactive phytochemicals present in leaves and pods of senna. The extraction efficiency in terms of yield and composition of the extract of senna prepared using both conventional (cold percolation at room temperature and refluxing) and non conventional (ultrasound and microwave assisted solvent extraction as well as supercritical fluid extraction) techniques were compared in the present study. Also a rapid reverse phase HPLC-PDA detection method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of sennoside A and sennoside B in the different extracts of senna leaves. Ultrasound and microwave assisted solvent extraction techniques were more effective in terms of yield and composition of the extracts compared to cold percolation at room temperature and refluxing methods of extraction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Directorate of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) , Anand , India."}], "LastName": "Dhanani", "ForeName": "Tushar", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Directorate of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) , Anand , India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Raghuraj", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Directorate of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) , Anand , India."}], "LastName": "Reddy", "ForeName": "Nagaraja", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Directorate of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) , Anand , India."}], "LastName": "Trivedi", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Directorate of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) , Anand , India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Satyanshu", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sennosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8013-11-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Senna Extract"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Reverse-Phase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Supercritical Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Senna Extract"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Senna Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sennosides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27855501", "10.1080/14786419.2016.1258562"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
