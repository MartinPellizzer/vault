Recently, increasing researches have demonstrated that POH may be useful, not only as flavor compound, but also as bioactive molecule because of a variety of biological activities.", "The aim of this review is to summarize the production, pharmacological activities and molecular mechanism, active derivatives, toxicity and parmacokinetics, and industrial application of POH.", "A systematic search of published articles up to January 2024 in Web of Science, China Knowledge Network, and PubMed databases is conducted using the following keywords: POH, POH derivatives, biological or pharmacological, production or synthesis, pharmacokinetics, toxicity and application.", "Biotechnological production is considered to be a potential alternative approach to generate POH. POH provides diverse pharmacological benefits, including anticancer, antimicrobial, insecticidal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypotensive, vasorelaxant, antinociceptive, antiasthmatic, hepatoprotective effects, etc. The underlying mechanisms of action include modulation of NF-\u03baB, JNK/c-Jun, Notch, Akt/mTOR, PI3K/Akt/eNOS, STAT3, Nrf2 and ERS response pathways, mitigation of mitochondrial dysfunction and membrane integrity damage, and inhibition of ROS accumulation, pro-inflammatory cytokines release and NLRP3 activation. What's more, the proteins or genes influenced by POH against diseases refer to Bax, Bcl-2, cyclin D1, CDK, p21, p53, HIF-1\u03b1, AP-1, caspase-3, M6P/IGF2R, PARP, VEGF, etc. Some clinical studies report that intranasal delivery of POH is a safe and effective treatment for cancer, but further clinical investigations are needed to confirm other health benefits of POH in human healthy. Depending on these health-promoting properties together with desirable flavor and safety, POH can be employed as dietary supplement, preservative and flavor additive in food and cosmetic fields, as building block in synthesis fields, as anticancer drug in medicinal fields, and as pesticides and herbicides in agricultural fields.", "This review systematically summarizes the recent advances in POH and highlights its therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms as well as the clinical settings, which is helpful to develop POH into functional food and new candidate drug for prevention and management of diseases. Future studies are needed to conduct more biological activity studies of POH and its derivatives, and check their clinical efficacy and potential side effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
