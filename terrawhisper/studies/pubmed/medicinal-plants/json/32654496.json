However, no systematic reviews of the efficacy and safety of HM for treatment of ICPP have been reported. Thus, this systematic review assessed the efficacy and safety of HM for ICPP. Most available clinical trials that investigated HM for ICPP were included in this review. <b><i>Methods and analysis:</i></b> Eleven databases, including Asian databases, were searched from the date of inception until June 2018. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed HM for ICPP. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Nine RCTs including 650 participants with ICPP, were included in this review. As a result of meta-analysis, response rate of HM group was 1.14 times higher compared with control group, with moderate level of evidence. Also, serum estradiol (E2) level was significantly lower in HM group compared to control group with moderate level of evidence. Notably, serum luteinizing hormone (LH) level (IU/L) and E2 level were significantly lower in HM group than triptorelin injection group with moderate level of evidence. Bone age index and uterine volume were also significantly lower in HM group than control group with very low level of evidence. The incidence of adverse events was lower in the HM group than control group, but it was not statistically significant. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> According to the results of the meta-analysis, it seems that HM treatment has a significant effect on the treatment of ICPP and can effectively reduce serum LH, E2 level, and bone age. In particular, as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog therapy has a negative effect on the growth rate and final height if bone age \u226513 years, this study suggests that HM treatment may be helpful. Additional higher quality RCTs are needed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of HM for treatment of ICPP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, College of Korean Medicine, Gachon University, Seongnam, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Yoo Been", "Initials": "YB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hwa-pyeong Institute of Integrative Medicine, Incheon, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Ju Ah", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, College of Korean Medicine, Daejeon University, Daejeon, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hye Lim", "Initials": "HL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Altern Complement Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9508124", "ISSNLinking": "1075-5535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12629-01-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Human Growth Hormone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Human Growth Hormone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Puberty, Precocious"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research Design"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32654496", "10.1089/acm.2019.0312"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
