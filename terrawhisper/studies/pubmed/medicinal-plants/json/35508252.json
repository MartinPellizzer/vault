This study aimed to investigate whether eugenol regulates liver lipid accumulation in high-fat diet (HFD) induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) rats via the gut-brain-liver axis involving glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Hepatic vagotomy was performed in NAFLD rats to determine the role of eugenol in regulating hepatic lipid accumulation via vagus nerve. The results showed that after eight weeks of eugenol administration in NAFLD rats, serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and hepatic TG decreased. However, eugenol showed no significant effect on the increased food intakes and weight gain caused by the HFD. Eugenol promoted the secretion of GLP-1 into the blood, increased GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) expression in the duodenum, liver, arcuate nucleus (ARC) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN), increased c-fos expression in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), and promoted ZO-1 and occludin expression in duodenum. Furthermore, steatosis and lipid accumulation were significantly alleviated. Hepatic vagotomy partially attenuated the improvement of eugenol in hepatic lipid accumulation in NAFLD rats. In conclusion, eugenol regulates hepatic lipid metabolism via a gut-brain-liver axis involving in GLP-1, providing a new strategy for the treatment of NAFLD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
