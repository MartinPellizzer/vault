In this context, migration and tissue distribution of immunocompetent cells may be prerequisites for an efficient immune surveillance. The effect of various non-cytotoxic concentrations of the Viscum album L. (mistletoe) preparation Iscadore QuFrF on the locomotory activity of immunomagnetically isolated human CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes from healthy donors was investigated. Cellular migration was examined within a three-dimensional collagen matrix. Donor-dependent variations in baseline activities of spontaneously locomoting T cells were accompanied by individual response patterns of T cells from different donors in the presence of various concentrations of mistletoe preparation (0.25-2.5 micrograms/ml). Using the three-dimensional collagen matrix assay an induction of locomotory activity was detected in a highly reproducible fashion although the optimal concentration of mistletoe preparation and the time point of maximal response were individual for each donor. Our data suggest that the direct stimulation of T-cell migration by mistletoe components may modulate the system of immune surveillance and recognition in patients under mistletoe therapy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Immunology, University of Witten/Herdecke, Germany."}], "LastName": "Nikolai", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Friedl", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Werner", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Z\u00e4nker", "ForeName": "K S", "Initials": "KS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Drugs", "NlmUniqueID": "9100823", "ISSNLinking": "0959-4973"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BK9092J5MP", "NameOfSubstance": "viscum album peptide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Donors"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chemotaxis, Leukocyte"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9179371", "10.1097/00001813-199704001-00014"]}}]}
