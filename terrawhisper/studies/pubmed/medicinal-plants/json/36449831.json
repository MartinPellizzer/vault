Although one of the most unfriendly environments for plant growth is deserts, desert plants can influence their surrounding microbial population and choose favorable bacteria that encourage their growth under these severe circumstances. Senna italica is known for its excellent medicinal values as a traditional medical plant, but little is known about its associated endophytic bacterial community under extreme conditions. In the present study, metagenomic sequencing of 16S rRNA was used to report the diversity of endophytic bacterial communities associated with the leaves and roots of the desert medicinal plant Senna italica that was collected from the Asfan region in northeast Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Analyses of the 16S rRNA sequences at the taxonomic phylum level revealed that bacterial communities in the roots and leaves samples belonged to five phyla, including Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and unclassified phyla. Results indicated that the most common phyla were Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast and Actinobacteria. Analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences at the taxonomic phylum level revealed that bacterial communities in the roots and leaves samples belonged to twelve genera at the taxonomic genus level. The most abundant ones were highlighted for further analysis, including Okibacterium and Streptomyces found in Actinobacteria, which were the dominant genus in roots samples. However, Streptophyta found in Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast was the dominant genus in leaf samples. Metagenomic analysis of medicinal plants leads to identifying novel organisms or genes that may have a role in abiotic stress resistance in the plant. The study of endophytic microbiome taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity will better know innovative candidates that may be selected as biological agents to enhance agricultural and industrial processes, especially for crop desert agricultural improvement."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3398-6369"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Jeddah, College of Science, Department of Biology, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alsaedi", "ForeName": "Z S", "Initials": "ZS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3287-2332"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Jeddah, College of Science, Department of Biology, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ashy", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5336-038X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, College of Sciences, Department of Biology, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Shami", "ForeName": "A Y", "Initials": "AY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6358-4144"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Jeddah, College of Science, Department of Biology, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Majeed", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8359-4558"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Jeddah, College of Science, Department of Biology, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alswat", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4128-4196"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Abdulaziz University, Faculty of Science, Department of Biochemistry, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Baz", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0235-5222"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Jeddah, College of Science, Department of Biology, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Baeshen", "ForeName": "M N", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8372-9117"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Jeddah, College of Science, Department of Biology, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Jalal", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101129542", "ISSNLinking": "1519-6984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36449831", "10.1590/1519-6984.267584", "S1519-69842022000100767"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
