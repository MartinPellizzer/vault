In the present study, the inhibitory effects and anti thrombic properties of HOT on the progression of atherosclerotic lesions were studied using the spontaneous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) model, Kurosawa and Kusanagi-hypercholesterolemic (KHC) rabbits and rats. Changes in blood chemistry, pathology and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation were measured in a control and HOT group. In the control group, the area of atheromatous plaques of the aorta progressed between week 12 (36.65%) and week 14 (46.22%). This progression of atherosclerotic lesions did not occur in the HOT-treated group after 12 (24.24%) and 14 (23.34%) weeks. Antioxidative effects on LDL were seen in the HOT in weeks 12 and 14. HOT improved the hypercholesterolemia in the KHC rabbits. On the other hand, HOT and five of the seven herbs, except Cnidii Rhizoma and Carthami Flos, inhibited the endotoxin-induced hepatic venous thrombosis in high cholesterol diet-treated rats. However, Ciniamomi Cortex showed a very weak inhibitory effect on the endotoxin-induced hepatic venous thrombosis. The extract also inhibited the endotoxin-induced decrease in blood platelets and fibrinogen, and endotoxin-induced increase in fibrin degradation products (FDP) on disseminated intravascular coagulation in normal rats. In conclusion, these results suggest that HOT has inhibitory effects on the development of atheromatous plaque formation in spontaneous FH rabbits. It is also suggested that the antioxidative effects of HOT on LDL led to the beneficial effects observed in this study. The protection by HOT and its herbs on the artificially induced ischemic infarction might be related to their inhibitory effects on disseminated intravascular coagulation, platelet coagulation and thrombotic action."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Diagnosis, College of Oriental Medicine, Dongguk University and National Research Laboratory for Glycobiology, Korean Ministry of Science and Technology, Kyungbuk, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Won-Hwan", "Initials": "WH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Mun-Yeob", "Initials": "MY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Kang-Hyun", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyung-Min", "Initials": "HM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Young-Choon", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Cheorl-Ho", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticholesteremic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anticholesteremic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Atherosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Venous Thrombosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16261513", "10.1002/ptr.1700"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
