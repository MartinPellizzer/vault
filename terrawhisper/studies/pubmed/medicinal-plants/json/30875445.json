The essential oils (EOs) of Euphorbia heterophylla are poorly studied. Therefore, the present study aimed to provide a detailed profile of the E. heterophylla EOs as well as to determine their antioxidant and allelopathic activities. The EOs from aerial parts of E. heterophylla were extracted using hydrodistillation and analyzed via GC/MS. The antioxidant activity was determined based on scavenging of the free radical, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> . Various concentrations of the EOs were tested against the noxious weed, Cenchrus echinatus. Thirty-five compounds were identified representing 100\u2009% of the total mass. Four classes of components were characterized, among which terpenoids were the main components (88.70\u2009%). Monoterpenes represented the main class (69.48\u2009%), followed by sesquiterpenes (18.63\u2009%), and only one diterpenoid, kaur-16-ene, was identified. 1,8-Cineole (32.03\u2009%), camphor (16.54\u2009%), \u03b2-elemene (5.92\u2009%), endo-borneol (4.94\u2009%), limonene (4.27\u2009%), pentatriacontane (3.91\u2009%), and \u03b1-pinene (3.89\u2009%) were the major compounds. The EOs composition of Egyptian E. heterophylla ecospecies was comparable to that of other reported Euphorbia species, although it showed no correlation with Nigerian E. heterophylla ecospecies. The EOs from E. heterophylla aerial parts exhibited significant antioxidant activity. Moreover, a concentration of 100\u2005\u03bcL\u2009L<sup>-1</sup> of the EOs reduced the germination, root, and shoot growth of C. echinatus by about 93.95\u2009%, 84.6\u2009%, and 57.8\u2009%, respectively. Therefore, the EOs from E. heterophylla could be integrated into the control of this weed, as eco-friendly biocontrol method. Further study is needed to characterize their allelopathic activity under field conditions as well as to evaluate their durability and biosafety."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Compounds Chemistry, National Research Center, 33 El Bohouth St., Dokki, Giza, 12622, Egypt."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokushima Bunri University, Yamashiro-cho, Tokushima, 770-8514, Japan."}], "LastName": "Elshamy", "ForeName": "Abdelsamed I", "Initials": "AI"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5903-6329"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Production Department, College of Food & Agriculture Sciences, King Saud University, P.O.
