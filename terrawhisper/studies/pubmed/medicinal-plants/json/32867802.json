Investigating home gardens was regarded as an effective way to understand the biodiversity-related local knowledge and culture of native people in Ethnobiology and Ethnoecology. Home garden is important in less developed and remote areas. The grand canyon of Yarlung Tsangpo is designed as one of the biodiversity hotspots of China, and it is one of the most remote regions of China, because of the rough traffic conditions. The aim of the present study is to collect, record, and document the plants and their local knowledge and functions in the local home gardens, then attempt to answer the question: \"why local people selected these plants?\"", "The study area was in Beibeng Township of Motuo County in the grand canyon of Yarlung Tsangpo. Observation and semi-structure interviews with informed consent were used to collect data in field study. All information was collected and organized, then documented based on \"ethno-species\" as a fundamental unit. All of the information of local use and knowledge were organized as the list of \"use-report\" for quantitative analysis, and the local uses of plants were merged into 14 use categories. Frequency of citation (FC), relative frequency of citation (RFC), cultural importance index (CI), and cultural value index (CV) were used in quantitative analysis. Besides, the Jaccard Index was used to compare the similarity in plant species selection among different communities.", "A total of 78 home gardens in the 9 communities of Beibeng Township were visited, and 196 ethno-species were collected. These ethno-species were identified into 188 Botanical taxa. A total of 87 home garden owners as informants were interviewed in the present study, and they provided 625 use-reports to us. The top 5 important plants were Su-lan-tsao (Dendrobium nobile), Sa-ga (Zingiber officinale), Soe-lu (Capsicum annuum), Snying-pa (Citrus medica), and Kham-pu (Prunus persica), according to the quantitative analysis. The most citied use-category was \"vegetable,\" followed by \"ornamental plant,\" \"medicine,\" and \"fruit.\" The altitude might be the most important impact factor of the plant diversity and composition of home gardens, and the traffic conditions, local terrain, also impact the plant diversity and composition of home gardens.", "In remote areas such as the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon, the plants in home gardens are important sources of plant products such as foods, herbal medicines, and fibers to support daily lives. The local home gardens in Tsang-la communities had high diversity of plants, and these plants provided many functions and services to support daily lives of local people. Local plant knowledge, including the features, life forms, habits, habitats, and use values of plants, were the summary of the understanding of local people to their surrounding plant worlds. Local people selected appropriate plants to cultivate and manage in their home gardens under the guidance of the local plant knowledge. That is the answer to the question \"why local people selected these plants?\""]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0447-3986"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Key Laboratory for Wild Plant Resources, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Economic Plants and Biotechnology, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Key Laboratory for Wild Plant Resources, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Economic Plants and Biotechnology, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Li-Xin", "Initials": "LX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Photochemistry and Plant Resources in West China, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ming-Xiang", "Initials": "MX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Germplasm Bank of Wild Species of China, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, 650201, Yunnan, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Yong-Jie", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Key Laboratory for Wild Plant Resources, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Economic Plants and Biotechnology, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Microbial Resources of the Ministry of Education, Yunnan Institute of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Yunnan University, Kunming, 650091, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Key Laboratory for Wild Plant Resources, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China. wangyuhua@mail.kib.ac.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Economic Plants and Biotechnology, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China. wangyuhua@mail.kib.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yu-Hua", "Initials": "YH"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "No.2019QZKK0502", "Agency": "Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "XDA20050204, XDA19050301, and XDA19050303", "Agency": "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnobiol Ethnomed", "NlmUniqueID": "101245794", "ISSNLinking": "1746-4269"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodiversity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gardening"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Knowledge"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no competing interests."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Kumar B M, Nair P K R.
