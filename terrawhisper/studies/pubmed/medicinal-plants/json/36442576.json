(Clusiaceae), commonly known as St. John's wort, has a rich historical background as one of the oldest and most widely studied herbal medicines. Hyperforin is the main antidepressant active ingredient of St. John's wort. In recent years, hyperforin has attached increasing attention due to its multiple pharmacological activities. In this review, the information on hyperforin was systematically summarized. Hyperforin is considered to be a lead compound with diverse pharmacological activities including anti-depression, anti-tumor, anti-dementia, anti-diabetes and others. It can be obtained by extraction and synthesis. Further pharmacological studies and more precise detection methods will help develop a value for hyperforin. In addition, structural modification and pharmaceutical preparation technology will be beneficial to promoting the research progress of hyperforin based innovative drugs. Although these works are full of known and unknown challenges, researchers are still expected to make hyperforin play a greater value."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
