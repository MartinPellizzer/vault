By screening dozens of reported natural compounds using both wild-type and mutant IDH1 enzymatic assays, we discovered Licochalcone A is a selective inhibitor to the R132C-mutant IDH1 with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 5.176\u00a0\u03bcM, and inhibits the proliferation of sarcoma HT-1080 cells with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 10.75\u00a0\u03bcM. Suggested by the molecular docking results, Licochalcone A might occupy the allosteric pocket between the two monomers of IDH1 homodimer, and the R132H mutation was unfavorable for the binding of Licochalcone A with the IDH1 protein, as compared to the R132C mutation. Revealed by the RNA-Seq data analysis, the Cell Cycle pathway was the most over-represented pathway for HT-1080 cells treated with Licochalcone A. Consistent with these results, Licochalcone A induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of HT-1080 cells, while it showed minimal effect against the proliferation of normal RCTEC cells. The discovery of Licochalcone A as a mutation-selective IDH1 inhibitor can serve as a promising starting point for the development of mutation-selective anti-tumor lead compounds targeting IDH1."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
