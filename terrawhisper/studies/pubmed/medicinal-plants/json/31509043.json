The most commonly known CTS are ouabain, digoxin, digoxigenin and bufalin. CTS can be used for safer medication of congestive heart failure and other related conditions due to promising pharmacological and medicinal properties. Ouabain isolated from plants is widely utilized in <i>in vitro</i> studies to specifically block the sodium potassium (Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) pump. For checking, whether ouabain derivatives are robust inhibitors of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump, molecular docking simulation was performed between ouabain and its derivatives using YASARA software. The docking energy falls within the range of 8.470\u2009kcal/mol to 7.234\u2009kcal/mol, in which digoxigenin was found to be the potential ligand with the best docking energy of 8.470\u2009kcal/mol. Furthermore, pharmacophore modeling was applied to decipher the electronic features of CTS. Molecular dynamics simulation was also employed to determine the conformational properties of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-ouabain and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-digoxigenin complexes with the plausible structural integrity through conformational ensembles for 100\u2009ns which promoted digoxigenin as the most promising CTS for treating conditions of congestive heart failure patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Bioinformatics and Climate Change Impacts Management, University School of Science, Gujarat University , Ahmedabad , India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Chirag N", "Initials": "CN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Biophysics Unit, Indian Institute of Science , Bangalore , India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Sivakumar Prasanth", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "J.
