Cell viability assay indicated that most compounds exhibited potent antiproliferative activity against all the tested cancer cells. Among them, compound 7l displayed the best antiproliferative activity particularly in A549 cells, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0\u03bcM. RNA-seq analysis was employed to explore the potential pathways related to the antiproliferative activity of compound 7l. The data revealed that 7l exerted antiproliferative activity mainly by regulating cell cycle, DNA replication and p53 signaling pathway. Indeed, compound 7l induced G2/M phase arrest by AURKB transcription inhibition and resulted in cell apoptosis via p53 signaling pathway. Most importantly, compound 7l demonstrated potent antitumor activity in A549 xenograft tumor model. Collectively, 7l might be a promising lead compound for the development of new therapeutic agents for AURKB overexpressed or mutated cancers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
