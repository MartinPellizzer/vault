Crude baicalin was obtained by extraction with methanol-water (70:30, v/v) from S. baicalensis Georgi. The separation was performed in two steps with a two-phase solvent system composed of n-butanol-water (1:1, v/v), in which the lower phase was used as the mobile phase at a flow-rate of 1.0 ml min(-1) in the head-to-tail elution mode. A total of 37.0 mg of baicalin at 96.5% purity was yielded from 200 mg of the crude baicalin (containing 21.6% baicalin) with 86.0% recovery as determined by HPLC analysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Hai-Tao", "Initials": "HT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "347Q89U4M5", "NameOfSubstance": "baicalin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Countercurrent Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Scutellaria baicalensis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14584696", "10.1016/j.chroma.2003.08.012", "S0021-9673(03)01424-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
