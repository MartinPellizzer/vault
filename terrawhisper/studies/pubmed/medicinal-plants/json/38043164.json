The biological potential of compounds from plants of the Solanaceae family against infectious diseases is known, however, it is still unknown against Sporothrix brasiliensis. This study evaluated the anti-Sporothrix brasiliensis activity, synergism, cytotoxicity, and action mechanism of steroidal lactones (withanolides) and alkaloids isolated from these plants. Pure compounds of withanolide D (WNOD), physalin F (PHYF), withanicandin (WNIC), nicandin B (NICB), solasonine (SSON), and solamargine (SMAR) were tested against 12 Sporothrix brasiliensis isolated from cats (n = 11) and dogs (n = 2) through M38-A2 CLSI. For the compounds with the best activity, a checkerboard assay for synergism, sorbitol protection, and ergosterol effect for action mechanism; and MTT test for cytotoxicity were performed. The withanolides WNOD, PHYF, WNIC, and NICB were not antifungal, but SSON (MIC 0.125-1 mg/mL) and SMAR (MIC 0.5-1 mg/mL) were both fungistatic and fungicidal (MFC 0.5-1 mg/mL for both) against wild-type (WT) and non-WT isolates. The activity of SSON and SMAR was indifferent when combined with itraconazole. In the mechanism of action, cell wall and plasma membrane by complexation with ergosterol seemed to be two target structures of SSON and SMAR. SSON was selected for cytotoxicity, whose cell viability in MDBK cells ranged from 28.85 % to 101.75 %, and was higher than 87.49 % at concentrations \u22640.0015 mg/ml. Only the steroidal alkaloids SSON and SMAR were active against non-WT isolates, being promising antifungal candidates for the treatment of feline and canine sporotrichosis with low susceptibility to itraconazole."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 SFMM.
