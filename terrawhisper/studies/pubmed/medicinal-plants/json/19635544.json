The majority of the people of Ghana and Africa still patronize traditional medicine for their health needs including various forms of wounds. The aim of this study is the identification of medicinal plants, type of wounds, dosage forms and collection methods used traditionally in treating wounds in the Bosomtwi-Atwima-Kwanwoma district, Ghana. In vitro screening of selected extracts from these plants on cell physiology of human dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes was to be performed.", "Validated questionnaires were administered to 78 traditional healers in 54 communities of the district. Interviews and structured conversations were used to administer the questionnaires. Selected herbal material dominantly used by the healers was collected, identified and aqueous and ethanolic extracts were investigated in vitro on influence on cell physiology of keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts (MTT-, BrdU-, LDH-assay). Antioxidant activities of ethanolic extracts were determined by free radical scavenging activity. Antiadhesive activity against Helicobacter pylori on human stomach cells was investigated for extracts reported to be used for stomach ulcer treatment.", "The ethnopharmacological survey revealed 104 plants species belonging to 47 families. The detailed use of these plants is documented. Aqueous extracts of Phyllanthus muellerianus, Pycnanthus angolensis and Combretum smeathmanni influenced the mitochondrial activity and proliferation of dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes significantly. Ethanolic extracts of selected plants exhibited strong antioxidant activities comparable to alpha-tocopherol. For Spathodea campanulata, Hoslundia opposita and Pycnanthus angolensis, which were reported by the healers to be used also for wound healing in case of stomach ulcers, strong antiadhesive activity against Helicobacter pylori was demonstrated, while the extracts did not exhibit any direct cytotoxicity against the bacterium.", "Traditional use of many wound-healing plants from Ghana can be well rationalized by the in vitro investigation of aqueous extracts. E.g. extracts of Phyllanthus muellerianus, Pycnanthus angolensis and Combretum smeathmanni exhibited significant influence on the cell viability and proliferation of keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agyare", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Asase", "ForeName": "Alex", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lechtenberg", "ForeName": "Matthias", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Niehues", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deters", "ForeName": "Alexandra", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hensel", "ForeName": "Andreas", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ghana"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interviews as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Keratinocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Wounds and Injuries"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19635544", "10.1016/j.jep.2009.07.024", "S0378-8741(09)00455-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
