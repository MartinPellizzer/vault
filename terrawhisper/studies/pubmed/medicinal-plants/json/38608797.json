Given the significant impact of snakebites on public health and the limitations of antivenom, coupled with the diverse molecular composition of this plant species, investigating its healing and antidermonecrotic capacities is relevant.", "This study aimed to develop a topical nanoemulsion incorporating the hydroethanolic extract of J. gossypiifolia leaves, to evaluate its therapeutic potential, particularly in terms of its efficacy in wound healing and inhibition of dermonecrosis induced by B. erythromelas venom (BeV).", "The extract of J. gossypiifolia (JgE) leaves was obtained by maceration and remaceration. The phytochemical analysis was conducted and J. gossypiifolia nanoemulsion (JgNe) was obtained, characterized and assessed for stability. The cytotoxicity was determined in normal cells (erythrocytes and 3T3) using hemolytic assay and cell viability assay using crystal violet staining. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by the reduction of ABTS and DPPH radicals. The evaluation of wound healing was conducted in vivo following treatment with JgNe, wherein the percentage of wound closure and inflammatory mediators. The skin irritation test was assessed in vivo by applying JgNe directly to the animal's skin. In vitro, the antivenom capacity was evaluated through enzymatic inhibition assays (phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> and hyaluronidase) of BeV. Additionally, the in vivo antidermonecrotic activity of JgNe was evaluated by measuring the reduction of the dermonecrotic halo.", "The HPLC-DAD analysis identified flavonoids, specifically vitexin, luteolin derivatives and apigenin derivatives. In addition, 95.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.46\u00a0mg of gallic acid/g of extract and 137.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.99\u00a0mg quercetin/g extract, was quantified. JgNe maintained stability over a 4-week period. Moreover, JgE and JgNe demonstrated no cytotoxicity in human erythrocytes and murine fibroblasts at tested concentrations (32.25-250\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). Additionally, exhibited significant antioxidant activity by reducing ABTS and DPPH radicals. The treatment with JgNe did not induce skin irritation and accelerated wound healing, with significant wound closure observed from 5th day and reduction in nitrite levels, myeloperoxidase activity, and cytokine. Both JgE and JgNe demonstrated in vitro inhibition of the phospholipase and hyaluronidase enzymes of BeV. Moreover, JgNe exhibited antidermonecrotic activity by reducing the dermonecrotic halo caused by BeV after 24\u00a0h.", "JgNe and JgE exhibited no cytotoxicity at the tested concentrations. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that JgNe has the ability to accelerate wound closure and reduce dermonecrosis caused by BeV, indicating to be promising formulation for complementary therapy to antivenom treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
