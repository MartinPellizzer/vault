The results indicated the differences of secondary and tertiary veins among those Diospyros species. The single cell non-glandular hair and glandular hair exist in most species' epidermis while stone cells were only found in the leaf powders of two species. Through the study, the main differences of leaf macro- and micro-morphology of these species were obtained and practical keys were also established, which can provide scientific base not only for identification of these species during their vegetative stages, but also for accuracy authentication of the source of Kaki Folium."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "LastName": "Yi", "ForeName": "Ze", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "LastName": "Qiao", "ForeName": "Juan-Juan", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Geng-Yu", "Initials": "GY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Guo-Yong", "Initials": "GY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Min-Jian", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Diospyros"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28929679", "10.4268/cjcmm20162110"]}}]}
