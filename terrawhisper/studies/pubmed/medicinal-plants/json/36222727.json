Moore is a perennial liana and is widely cultivated in southern China for traditional Chinese medicine as a diuretic, anti-inflammatory, and antirheumatic treatment (Jiang et al. 2020). In August 2021, it was observed that a severe stem rot disease affected St. tetrandra cultivated in Anfu, Jiangxi province, China (114\u00b027'26\" E, 27\u00b022'46\" N). The disease symptoms included constriction and rot at the base of the stem, and covered with a layer of white mycelia. The plants above-ground finally wilted and dried with a disease incidence ranging from 8% to 16%. Lots of dried plants formed withered patches of field. Sections (1.0~2.0 cm) from browning stem tissues were surface-disinfected with 75% ethanol for 15 s, followed by 60 s in 4% NaClO, rinsed twice in sterile water, dried on sterilized filter paper, placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at 26\u00b0C in the dark for 3 days. A white rhizomorphic fungal mycelium, that is similar to the mycelium of strain FJSR0 on the surface of an infected plant in the field, was isolated from the cultured tissues with 67% frequency. When incubated on PDA, white and fluffy mycelia with even margins and a slight halo formed. Mycelia-produced clamp connections were observed. Colonies grew quickly and covered the dish (diameter: 9 cm) in 5 or 6 days. After that, sclerotia were initially white, then turned yellow, and chestnut brown at maturity. Spherical and subspherical sclerotia were observed after 8 days, with each plate containing 448 to 634 sclerotia (0.8 to 1.4 mm diameter; mean = 0.94 mm; n = 50). On the basis of morphology, the pathogen was similar to Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc. [teleomorph: Athelia rolfsii (Curzi) Tu & Kimbrough] (Sun et al. 2020; Ling et al. 2021). For molecular confirmation, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region with approximately 680 bp was amplified from strains FJRS0 and FJRS1 using primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990). Two distinct types (different in one SNP and one 1-bp InDel) of ITS sequences were obtained from each isolate, and all isolates contain the two types (FJSR0: ON972516, ON972517; FJSR1: ON972520, ON972518). BLAST analysis of each type found that the hits, with identities >99%, are A. rolfsii except for two Sc. delphinii sequences (GU567775.1 and MK073010.1). Phylogenetic analysis placed strains FJSR0 and FJSR1 in the same clade as Sc. rolfsii but away from Sc. delphinii based on the previous method (Sun et al. 2021). Both morphological and molecular characteristics confirmed that the strains were Sc. rolfsii. For pathogenicity tests, PDA plugs (8 mm in diameter) covered with 5-day-old fungal mycelium were inoculated at the stem bases of three healthy St. tetrandra seedings and incubated at 26\u2103 and relative humidity of 80%. On the fifth day, inoculated plants were wilting. The infected stem bases turned brown to black and constricted as previously observed in the field. Some leaves, infected by the mycelium expanded from the PDA plugs, developed an orange and irregular spot. Sclerotia were observed 20 days post inoculation. In contrast, the leaves and stems of non-inoculated control plants remained symptomless. Pathogenicity tests were repeated three times. The fungus was reisolated consistently from each symptomatic tissue, thus completing Koch's postulates. Although Sc. rolfsii has been previously reported to cause a southern blight symptoms on vegetables, ornamentals, grass, and medicinal and leguminous crops (Sun et al. 2020; Ling et al. 2021), this is the first report of Sc. rolfsii causing similar symptoms of southern blight on St. tetrandra in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Plant Protection, No. 602, Nanlian Road, Qingyunpu District, Nanchang, China, 330200; yinchangfa@126.com."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Changfa", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Plant Protection, Nanchang, China; lanbo611@163.com."}], "LastName": "Lan", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Protection and Quarantine Station of Jiangxi Province, Nanchang, China; 610945329@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Protection and Quarantine Station of Jiangxi Province, Nanchang, China; 343197568@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Nianmei", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Plant Protection, Nanchang, China; chenjian2918@163.com."}], "LastName": "Jian", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Plant Protection, Nanchang, China; yyq8295@163.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ying-Qing", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Plant Protection, Nanchang, China; xmli1025@aliyun.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiangmin", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36222727", "10.1094/PDIS-08-22-2004-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
