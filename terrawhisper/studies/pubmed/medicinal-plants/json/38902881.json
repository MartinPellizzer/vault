Schischk. is one of the traditional medicinal herbs in northeast China, and its roots are used for medicinal purposes. In 2020, a fungus isolated from <i>S. divaricata</i> seeds was observed to cause root rot of seedlings, leaf spot and stem spot of adult plants in Shuangyashan, Heilongjiang, China. Based on morphological and molecular data, isolates of all fungi were identified as <i>Alternaria alternata</i>. To our knowledge, this is the first report of <i>A. alternata</i> isolated from <i>S. divaricata</i> seeds in China. The carrying rate of <i>S. divaricata</i> seeds from 20 different collection sites reached 100% in 70% of the sites in Hulunbeier area, Inner Mongolia, China. The <i>A. alternata</i> isolate could infect the roots of cucumber, sorghum, mung bean and maize seedlings and cause root rot. Considering the control of seed-associated fungal diseases, prochloraz 45% EW had the best control effect of 92.6%, followed by flusilazole 400 g L<sup>-1</sup> EC (88.9%) and azoxystrobin\u00b7propiconazole 18.7% SE (70.7%) of 15 fungicides. Further field control efficacy showed that 45% prochloraz EW had an 80% control efficacy on the disease at a dose of 0.225 g L<sup>-1</sup>. It is recommended that soaking seeds and spraying are the best treatments for controlling seed-associated fungi and leaf spot on <i>S. divaricata</i> caused by <i>A. alternata</i>. Therefore, above methods can effectively prevent the occurrence of fungal diseases of <i>S. divaricata</i> and provide a method to reduce reinfestation in the field."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northeast Agricultural University, College of Plant Protection, Harbin , China; 1298075062@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xue", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northeast Agricultural University, plant protection, No. 600, Changjiang Road, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China, 150030; 844115684@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jinxin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northeast Agricultural University, College of Agriculture, Harbin, Harbin, China; zhanglilizw@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lili", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northeast Agricultural University, plant protection, Agricultural College, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin Heilongjiang 150030, P.R.China, Harbin , China, 150030; neaulyg@126.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yonggang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northeast Agricultural University, plant protection, Harbin , China; 15663680071@163.com."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Baiyan", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperation of green source Chinese herbal medicine planting professional cooperative in Sihe village, Shuangyashan, China; baiyunlong2021@126.com."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Yunlong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38902881", "10.1094/PDIS-01-24-0257-RE"]}}]}
