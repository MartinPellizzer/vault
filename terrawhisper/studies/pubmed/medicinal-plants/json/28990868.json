Accordingly, in the present study, we aimed at evaluating the effects of oral intake of two structurally different flavonoids 5-hydroxy-6,7,4'-trimethoxyflavone (flavone 1) and 5,7,4'-trihydroxyflavone (flavone 2) on recognition memory, hippocampal protein level of immediate early gene cFos and mitochondrial dynamic markers in Amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2)-injected rats. Recognition aspect of memory and level of proteins were measured using novel object recognition test and Western blot, respectively. Our data indicated that even though flavone 1 was more effective than flavone 2 to prevent memory impairment, feeding with both flavones alleviated memory in A\u03b2-injected rats. Furthermore, in flavones-administered rats, mitochondrial dynamic balancing returned to the control level by the decline in Dynamin-related protein-1 protein level, a known marker for mitochondrial fission, and elevation in protein level of mitochondrial fusion factors Mitofusins 1 and 2. In parallel with behavior results, flavone 1 was more effectual on mitochondrial dynamic moderating. The more neuroprotective effects of flavone 1 could be attributed to its methylated structure leading to crossing of the blood-brain barrier with ease and metabolic stability and bioactivity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics (I.B.B.) , University of Tehran , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Arsalandeh", "ForeName": "Farshad", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Neuroscience Research Center , Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Khodagholi", "ForeName": "Fariba", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics (I.B.B.) , University of Tehran , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Ahmadian", "ForeName": "Shahin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c NeuroBiology Research Center , Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Foolad", "ForeName": "Forough", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c NeuroBiology Research Center , Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammadi Kamsorkh", "ForeName": "Hamed", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Phytochemistry , Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, G.
