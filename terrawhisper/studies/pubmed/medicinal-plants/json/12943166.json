Randomized trials comparing extract of radix Sophorae flavescentis versus placebo, no intervention, non-specific treatment, other active medicines, or interferon for chronic hepatitis B were identified by electronic and manual searches. Trials of Sophorae herb plus other drugs versus other drugs alone were also included. No blinding and language limitations were applied. The methodological quality of trials was assessed by the Jadad scale plus allocation concealment. Meta-analysis was performed where data was available. Twenty-two randomized trials (n = 2409) were included. Methodological quality of the trials was generally low. The combined results showed that matrine (aqueous extract of Sophorae flavescentis) had antiviral activity, positive liver biochemical effects, and improved symptoms and signs compared with non-specific treatment and other herbal medicines. The combination of matrine and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), thymosin, or basic treatment showed better effects on viral and liver biochemical responses. The antiviral and biochemical responses were not significantly different between matrine and IFN-alpha. No serious adverse event was reported. Based on the review, Sophorae flavescentis extract (matrine) may have antiviral activity and positive effects on liver biochemistry in chronic hepatitis B. However, the evidence is not sufficient to recommend matrine for routine clinical use due to the generally low methodological quality of the studies. Further rigorous trials are needed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.
