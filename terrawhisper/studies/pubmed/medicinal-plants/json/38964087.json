In this 5-month study, B. striata plants were exposed to three different light intensities: low light (LL) (5-20\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup>), middle light (ML) (200\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup>), and high light (HL) (400\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup>). The comprehensive assessment included growth, photosynthetic apparatus, chlorophyll fluorescence electron transport, and analysis of differential metabolites based on the transcriptome and metabolome data. The results indicated that ML resulted in the highest plant height and total polysaccharide content, enhanced photosynthetic apparatus performance and light energy utilization, and stimulated carbon metabolism and carbohydrate accumulation. HL reduced Chl content and photosynthetic apparatus functionality, disrupted OEC activity and electron transfer, stimulated carbon metabolism and starch and glucose accumulation, and hindered energy metabolism related to carbohydrate degradation and oxidation. In contrast, LL facilitated leaf growth and increased chlorophyll content but decreased plant height and total polysaccharide content, compromised the photosynthetic apparatus, hampered light energy utilization, stimulated energy metabolism related to carbohydrate degradation and oxidation, and inhibited carbon metabolism and carbohydrate synthesis. Numerous genes in carbon metabolism were strongly related to polysaccharide metabolites. The katE and cysK genes in carbon metabolism were strongly related not only to polysaccharide metabolites, but also to genes involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis. Our results highlight that light intensity plays a crucial role in affecting polysaccharide biosynthesis in B. striata, with carbon metabolism acting as a mediator under suitable light intensity conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
