The structures of the isolated compounds were identified on the basis of physicochemical properties and spectroscopic analysis,as well as comparisons with the data reported in the literature. Sixteen compounds were isolated from the 90% ethanol extract of the stems and leaves of C. emarginata,which were identified as siamenol( 1),murrastanine A( 2),3-formyl-1,6-dimethoxycarbazole( 3),3-methoxymethylcarbazole( 4),3-methylcarbazole( 5),murrayafoline A( 6),3-formylcarbazole( 7),3-formyl-1-hydroxycarbazole( 8),3-formyl-6-methoxycarbazole( 9),murrayanine( 10),murrayacine( 11),girinimbine( 12),nordentatin( 13),chalepin( 14),8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-pentylisocoumarin( 15) and ethyl orsellinate( 16). Compounds 1-4,14-16 were isolated from C. emarginata for the first time. Among them,compounds 1,2,15 and 16 were isolated from the genus Clausena for the first time. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against five human cancer cell lines: HL-60,SMMC-7721,A-549,MCF-7 and SW480 in vitro. Compounds 12 and 14 showed significant inhibitory effects against various human cancer cell lines with IC_(50) values comparable to those of doxorubicin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy,Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Fuzhou 350122,China Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158,China Key Laboratory of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Haikou City,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158,China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Shi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158,China Key Laboratory of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Haikou City,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158,China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jia-Ming", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158,China Key Laboratory of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Haikou City,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158,China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wen-Hao", "Initials": "WH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158,China Key Laboratory of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Haikou City,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158,China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ming-Ming", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158,China Key Laboratory of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Haikou City,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yan-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy,Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Fuzhou 350122,China Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158,China Key Laboratory of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Haikou City,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158,China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Yan-Hui", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "80168379AG", "NameOfSubstance": "Doxorubicin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Clausena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Doxorubicin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31355567", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190321.204"]}}]}
