Facing the challenges of severe side effects and drug resistance of conventional medications, to develop the strategies meet the stringent safety and effectiveness in the long-term treatment are urgent in the clinics. In this regard, a growing body of evidence confirms plant-sourced phenols, such as flavonoids, catechins, stilbenes, coumarins, quinones, lignans, phenylethanoids, cannabinoid phenols, tannins, phenolic acids and hydroxyphenols, exert potent protective benefits with fewer undesirable effects in conditions of acute or chronic intestinal inflammation through improvement of colonic oxidative and pro-inflammatory status, preservation of the epithelial barrier function and modulation of gut microbiota. In this review, the great potential of plant-sourced phenols and their action mechanisms for the treatment or prevention of IBD in recent research are summarized, which may help further development of new preventive/adjuvant regimens for IBD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Medicine, Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, 518060 Shenzhen 518060, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Pharmacology and Druggability for Natural Medicines of Department of Education, Guizhou Province, Guizhou Medical University, 550025 Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Hai-Tao", "Initials": "HT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, 518060 Shenzhen 518060, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Pharmacology and Druggability for Natural Medicines of Department of Education, Guizhou Province, Guizhou Medical University, 550025 Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Pharmacology and Druggability for Natural Medicines of Department of Education, Guizhou Province, Guizhou Medical University, 550025 Guizhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Optimal Utilization of Natural Medicinal Resources, Guizhou Medical University, 550025 Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Xiang-Chun", "Initials": "XC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Medicine, Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Bian", "ForeName": "Zhao-Xiang", "Initials": "ZX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Colon"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Microbiome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28990509", "10.2174/0929867324666171009100900", "CMC-EPUB-86256"]}}]}
