It has been considered edible by Bedouin and has been used traditionally as a medicinal herb. During a screening test of Arabian plants, the aqueous extract of Neurada procumbens increased the blood pressure of anaesthetized normotensive rats when it was administered orally. Further studies proved it elevated the blood pressure of conscious SHR, and produced vasoconstriction on the aortic strips of rats in vitro, which was reduced partially by phentolamine. This study demonstrates that the aqueous extract of the plant has an effect of increasing blood pressure that might be mediated through alpha-adrenergic receptors. Though more investigations are needed to prove its effect in humans, the present study warns that Neurada procumbens might not be so safe as it has been considered, and people, especially those with cardiovascular diseases, should be careful when they use the plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Zayed Complex for Herbal Research and Traditional Medicine, Ministry of Health, Post Box 29300, Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "H B", "Initials": "HB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Islam", "ForeName": "M W", "Initials": "MW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Radhakrishnan", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wahab", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Naji", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Structures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rosaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15013180", "10.1016/j.jep.2003.09.045", "S0378874103003465"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
