The development of TCM cause depends on the efficient utilization and sustainable development of CMM, hinges on the technologies and methods for using and discovering medicinal biological resources, stand or fall on the extension of industy chains, detailed utilizaion of resource chemical components by multi-way, multi-level. All of these may help to the recycling utilization and sound development of RCMM. In this article, five respects were discussed to the RCCMM researches and resources recycling utilization ways and goals and tasks. First, based on the principle of resource scarcity, discovering or replacing CMM resources, protecting the rare or endangered species or resources. Second, based on the multifunctionality of CMM, realizing the value-added and value compensation, and promoting the utilization efficiency through systermatic and detailed exploitation and utilization. Third, based on the resource conservation and environment-friendly, reducing raw material consumption, lowering cost, promoting recycling utilization and elevating utilization efficiency. Fourth, based on the stratege of turning harm into good, using the invasive alien biological resources by multi-ways and enriching the medicial resources. Fifth, based on the method of structure modification of chemical components, exploring and enhancing the utility value of resouces chemical substances. These data should provide references and attention for improving the utilization efficiency, promoting the development of recycling economy, and changing the mode of economic growth of agriculture and industry of CMM fundamentally."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Jin-ao", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Shu-lan", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Sheng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Shu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Pei", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Da-wei", "Initials": "DW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Hua-xu", "Initials": "HX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Yu-ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Qi-nan", "Initials": "QN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["economics", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "economics"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "economics"], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26978979"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
