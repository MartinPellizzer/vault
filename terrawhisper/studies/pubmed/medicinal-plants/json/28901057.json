Due to excessive use of wild resources and resource constraints, artificial cultivation is the only way to achieve sustainable use of resources. E. pseudowushannense is intended to achieve the first cultivated species, but plant production technology is not yet fully mature.The diurnal variation of photosynthetic and eco-physiological characteristics of E. pseudowushannense in different growing age was studied by the CI-340 Portable Photosynthesis System under natural conditions. The net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (C), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), relative humidity (RH), air temperature (Ta), apparent mesophyll conductance (ALMC), transpiration rate (E), leaf temperature (Tl), water use efficiency (WUE) and other photosynthetic physiological factors and environmental factors were measured. The obtained data was analyzed by correlation analysis, path analysis and stepwise multiple-regression analysis to explore the relationship between net photosynthetic rate and physiological and ecological factors. The results show that\uff1a \u2460The daily variation of the Pn, E, ALMC, C of E. pseudowushannense in different growing age took on\"two peak type\", the Pn was with an obvious midday depression phenomenon at noon.\u2461The Pn, ALMC and C of annuals' were significantly higher than biennial or three-year; but the Ci was basically a three-year > biennial> annual.\u2462The correlation analysis, path analysis and stepwise regression analysis showed that ALMC, Ci, Ta might played important role in the Pn and ranked as ALMC>Ci>Ta."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hong", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Jun-Qian", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Tongjitang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiang-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Tongjitang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Zhi-Hai", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Tongjitang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330006, China."}], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Bao-Lin", "Initials": "BL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Epimedium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Transpiration"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28901057", "10.4268/cjcmm20161202"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
