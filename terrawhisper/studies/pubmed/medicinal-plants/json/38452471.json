A successful clinical intervention for cancer cachexia is currently lacking. The study of cachexia mechanisms is largely based on preclinical animal models and the availability of high-throughput transcriptomic datasets of cachectic mouse muscles is increasing through the extensive use of next generation sequencing technologies.", "Cachectic mouse muscle transcriptomic datasets of ten different studies were combined and mined by seven attribute weighting models, which analysed both categorical variables and numerical variables. The transcriptomic signature of cancer cachexia was identified by attribute weighting algorithms and was used to evaluate the performance of eleven pattern discovery models. The signature was employed to find the best combination of drugs (drug repurposing) for developing cancer cachexia treatment strategies, as well as to evaluate currently used cachexia drugs by literature mining.", "Attribute weighting algorithms ranked 26 genes as the transcriptomic signature of muscle from mice with cancer cachexia. Deep Learning and Random Forest models performed better in differentiating cancer cachexia cases based on muscle transcriptomic data. Literature mining revealed that a combination of melatonin and infliximab has negative interactions with 2 key genes (Rorc and Fbxo32) upregulated in the transcriptomic signature of cancer cachexia in muscle.", "The integration of machine learning, meta-analysis and literature mining was found to be an efficient approach to identifying a robust transcriptomic signature for cancer cachexia, with implications for improving clinical diagnosis and management of this condition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
