Penetration, evaporation, and transpiration are the main processes for sludge dewatering in STBs. However, the leachate quality from STBs usually cannot meet discharge limits. Moreover, such leachate has very low COD/N ratio, which makes it difficult to treat. In the present study, two subsurface flow (SSF) constructed wetlands (CWs) were investigated for the treatment of leachate from STBs under three different hydraulic retention time (HRT) (3\u00a0days, 4\u00a0days, 6\u00a0days), aiming for evaluating the effects of plants and HRT on treatment performance, as well as the potential of SSF CWs to treat sludge leachate with low COD/N ration. The results showed that plants play an important role in leachate treatment. The best treatment performance was achieved with HRT of 4\u00a0days. In this condition, the mean removal efficiencies of COD (chemical oxygen demand), NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N, TN (total nitrogen), and TP (total phosphorus) in the planted and the unplanted CWs were 61.6% (unplanted -\u20093.7%), 76.6% (unplanted 43.5%), 70% (unplanted 41%), and 65.6% (unplanted 6%), respectively. Heavy metal concentrations were below the Chinese integrated wastewater discharge standard during the experimental period in the planted CW, and the removal efficiencies in the planted CW system were higher than in the unplanted CW system. In all, planted SSF CWs can be an effective approach in removing leachate from sludge treatment beds. Furthermore, considering to temperature and seasonal variation, the leachate from STBs needs to be further studied in pilot- and full-scale condition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
