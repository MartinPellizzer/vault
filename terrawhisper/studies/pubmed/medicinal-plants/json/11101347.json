Transformed root cultures of Stizolobium hassjoo producing L-DOPA were used as a model system. The serial dilution experiments facilitated logical choice of the upper and lower bounds on executing 2(11)(-)(6) fractional factorial design. Steepest ascent method as well as central composite design were sequentially employed to optimize the media of shake flask cultures. The modified B5 media of GM, PM, and GPM were obtained, indicating the optimum medium compositions for enhancing hairy root dry weight, L-DOPA content in hairy roots, and L-DOPA production, respectively. When cultivating S. hassjoo hairy roots in GM, PM and GPM for 16 days, the dry wt of hairy roots, L-DOPA content, and L-DOPA production obtained were ca. 530 mg per flask (10.6 g/L), 10.8% dry wt, and 806 mg/L, which were 1.8-, 2-, and 2.8-fold of basal B5 medium control runs, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei 10617, Taiwan, Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sung", "ForeName": "L S", "Initials": "LS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "S Y", "Initials": "SY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Prog", "NlmUniqueID": "8506292", "ISSNLinking": "1520-6033"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "46627O600J", "NameOfSubstance": "Levodopa"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Levodopa"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11101347", "10.1021/bp000062t", "bp000062t"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
