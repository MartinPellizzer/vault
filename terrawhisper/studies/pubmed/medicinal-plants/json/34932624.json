This study was designed to collect the ethnomedicinal and traditional knowledge of these locals about this group of vascular plants. Forty taxa belong to nineteen genera and ten families are used in the treatment of different diseases. The Pteridaceae was the most representative family with twelve taxa (30%), followed by Athyriaceae and Dryopteridaceae with six taxa each (30%), and Thelypteridaceae with five taxa (12.5%). Regarding the genera, Adiantum, Asplenium and Dryopteris ranked first with four taxa each (30%), followed by Aleuritopteris, Diplazium, Pteris and Equisetum with three taxa each (30%), followed by Athyrium, Oeosporangium, Polystichum and Pseudophegopteris with two taxa each (20%). These taxa were commonly used in the treatment of respiratory disorders i.e. asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, pneumonia; intestinal ulcer, stomach, urinary ailments and skin disorders by the methods of decoction and infusion. Traditional knowledge about ethnomedicinal plants is a valuable and essential source for the discovery of allopathic, herbal and homeopathic medicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6439-1504"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Abdul Wali Khan University, Department of Botany, Mardan, Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Swabi, Department of Botany, Swabi, Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.A."}], "LastName": "Irfan", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4231-9581"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Abdul Wali Khan University, Department of Botany, Mardan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Jan", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Abdul Wali Khan University, Department of Botany, Mardan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Murad", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Abdul Wali Khan University, Department of Botany, Mardan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Jan", "ForeName": "F G", "Initials": "FG"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2429-5491"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Swabi, Department of Chemistry, Swabi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rauf", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8747-7845"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Khalid University, College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacognosy, Abha, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alsayari", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8196-2612"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Saud University, College of Science, Department of Chemistry, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Almarhoon", "ForeName": "Z M", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9762-0323"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Khalid University, College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Abha, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Mabkhot", "ForeName": "Y N", "Initials": "YN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101129542", "ISSNLinking": "1519-6984"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ferns"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tracheophyta"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "25"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34932624", "10.1590/1519-6984.250256", "S1519-69842024000100152"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
