The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of PulmoFlex on isolated perfused rat lung. The lung tissues were perfused at a pressure of 50 mmHg using oxygenated Krebs solution at 37 degrees C. PulmoFlex (1 & 2 mg/ml) increased the pulmonary perfusion flow indicating its bronchodilatory action. PulmoFlex (500 mcg) significantly prevented histamine (50 mcg), acetylcholine (50 mcg) and C-48/80 (10 mcg), induced bronchoconstriction indicating its antihistaminic, anticholinergic and mast cell stabilizing actions on pulmonary vascular beds and bronchioles, respectively. Lung tissue of sensitized (BSA) rats treated with PulmoFlex (20 mg/kg x 10 days) showed better perfusion following Ex vivo antigenic challenge as compared to untreated rats. This indicates the possibility of suppression of IgE mediated immune reaction by PulmoFlex. Thus, the present findings, suggest that PulmoFlex acts as an antiasthmatic by its bronchodilatory, membrane stabilizing, antihistaminic, anticholinergic and immunomodulatory (reaginic antibody mediated) effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, College of Veterinary and Animal Science, HPKV, Palmpur."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chatterjee", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0374707", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5499"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Allergic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bronchodilator Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinergic Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Histamine H1 Antagonists"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Allergic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchodilator Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinergic Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine H1 Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Perfusion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10776466"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
