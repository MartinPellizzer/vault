Through the analysis of the multistage tandem mass spectrometry, the characteristic peaks were extracted with mass spectrometry data peak matching, peak alignment, and noise filtering. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were used for data processing. The chemical constituents were identified or tentative presumed according to MS accurate mass and MS/MS spectrometry fragmentation information, combined with the software of database search, comparison with reference standards and literature. The results show the differences among samples of Eucommiae Cortex from different habitats are distinguishable. A total of 23 chemical constituents in Eucommiae Cortex were identified or tentative presumed. Among of them, 14 kinds of common differential chemical constituents (aucubin, geniposidic acid, neochlorogenic acid, syringin, olivil-4',4'-di-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside, chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, 1-hydroxypinoresinol- 4',4'-di-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside, caffeic acid, pinoresinol-di-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside, syringaresionl-di-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside, pinoresinol-4'-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside, eucommiol, isochlorogenic acid C and asiatic acid) presented different changing laws.
