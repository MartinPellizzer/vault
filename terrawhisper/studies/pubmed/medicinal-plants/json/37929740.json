About 20 to 30% of PC patients experience cancer recurrence, characterized by an increase in the antigen termed serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Clinical recurrence of PC commonly occurs after five years. Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) has an intricate genomic background. Therapies that target genomic changes in DNA repair signaling pathways have been progressively approved in the clinic. Innovative therapies like targeting signaling pathways, bone niche, immune checkpoint, and epigenetic marks have been gaining promising results for better management of PC cases with bone metastasis. This review article summarizes the recent consideration of the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in local and metastatic prostate cancer, highlighting the clinical insinuations of the novel understanding."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Genetics Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic Syndrome Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Keyvani", "ForeName": "Vahideh", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kheradmand", "ForeName": "Nahid", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic Syndrome Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Basic Sciences Research Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahmoudian", "ForeName": "Reihaneh Alsadat", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic Syndrome Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Medicine, University of Warith Al-Anbiyaa, Karbala, Iraq."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health, Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane 4059, Australia."}], "LastName": "Avan", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiotherapy Oncology, Cancer Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Anvari", "ForeName": "Kazem", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "genetics", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37929740", "10.2174/0113816128265464231021172202", "CPD-EPUB-135720"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
