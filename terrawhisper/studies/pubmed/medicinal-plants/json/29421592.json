Lock (Fabaceae) is a shrub or tree found in Ethiopia and other African countries. It has been traditionally used for different conditions including treatment of pain conditions in humans and animals. Although various reports are available in the literature claiming different activities of the plant, scientific studies supporting analgesic potential of S. singueana are lacking and the present study aimed to investigate the antinociceptive effect of methanol extract of leaves of S. singueana in mice.", "Anti-nociceptive activity of S. singueana (200\u202fmg/kg and 400\u202fmg/kg, p.o) was investigated using acetic acid-induced writhing, formalin-induced paw licking, and hot plate tests. Acute oral toxicity was determined using a slightly modified guideline (423) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.", "S. singueana extract increased the percentage of inhibition of writhing response and licking response (neurogenic and inflammatory phase) in acetic acid-induced writhing and formalin-induced paw licking tests, respectively. It also significantly (p\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) increased the percentage of mean maximal effect (%MPE) compared to control group in the hot-plate test. In all models, the combination of S. singueana with either diclofenac or morphine produced statistically significant increase (p\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) in the percentage of inhibition of writhing, paw licking, and %MPE compared to single treatment groups. It was also found that the 400\u202fmg/kg extract produced higher antinociceptive effects (p\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) compared to the 200\u202fmg/kg.", "S. singueana leaves may have analgesic effect that is mediated through both peripheral and central mechanisms and could be used as adjuvant treatment to the modern analgesics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
