Their structures were established on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analyses (IR, UV, HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR). All compounds were evaluated for their anti-tobacco mosaic virus (anti-TMV) activities. The results showed that compound 10 exhibited significant anti-TMV activity with an inhibition rate of 67.57% (100\u202f\u03bcg/mL), which was higher than that of ningnamycin (52.89%)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
