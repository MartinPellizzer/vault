These plants have been utilized in traditional Tibetan medicine for centuries and are currently still employed to treat a variety of ailments, including acute and severe abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, epilepsy, ascariasis, lung abscess, and other diseases. The therapeutic properties of tangchong are attributed to the presence of tropane alkaloids (TAs), although recent research has also revealed their toxicity.", "The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the traditional uses of tangchong, as well as the phytochemical and pharmacological studies conducted on this plant. The review aims to offer a critical update on the current state of knowledge of tangchong and to identify new opportunities for exploring its therapeutic potential.", "To gather information on tangchong, we conducted a thorough search of several scientific databases, including Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scifinder, Baidu Scholar, PubMed, and CNKI.", "This review summarizes the traditional usage of 11 plants, 168 chemical components, including alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, amides, coumarins, etc., describes the pharmacological activities of these medicinal plants and their mechanisms of action, provides an elaboration of toxicology, and provides new plant-derived drugs and herbal preparations from tangchong.", "Clarity regarding the source of the drug is crucial to ensure the safety and efficacy of clinical applications of Tibetan medicine. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of tangchong, including its traditional medicinal uses, chemical composition, pharmacology, toxicology, and quality control measures. Our analysis highlights the significant value of tangchong as an ethnomedicinal resource, with pharmacological activities primarily linked to its alkaloid content. Furthermore, this review serves as a valuable reference for future research on alkaloid-containing ethnomedicines."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
