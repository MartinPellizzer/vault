The outbred white male Wistar rats, in which metabolic syndrome was induced by consuming a 10% fructose solution instead of drinking water for 42 days, were used. After the induction of metabolic syndrome, the mycelium of G. lucidum in the form of water suspension (a dose of 1 g/kg of the animal's body weight) was administered to animals per os for 7 and 14 days. Glucose concentration was determined using the glucose oxidase method. The content of glycosylated hemoglobin in erythrocytes was determined by the colorimetric method. The concentration of triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins, and low-density lipoproteins in blood plasma was determined by enzymatic methods. A significant decrease in the content of glycosylated hemoglobin was established in animals with metabolic syndrome against the background of administration of the studied suspension. Under the conditions of experimental metabolic syndrome, the administration of mycelium for 7 and 14 days led to a decrease in the concentration of triglycerides by 17.8 and 44.8%, cholesterol by 10.7 and 21.3%, low-density lipoproteins by 14.8 and 28.4%, and to an increase in high-density lipoproteins concentration by 11.9 and 21.5%, compared with metabolic syndrome. The obtained results demonstrate the corrective effect of the suspension of the G. lucidum powdered mycelium on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, which was directly proportional to the duration of administration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biology, Ivan Franko National University of Lviv, Lviv, Ukraine."}], "LastName": "Petryn", "ForeName": "Tetiana S", "Initials": "TS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biology, Ivan Franko National University of Lviv, Lviv, Ukraine."}], "LastName": "Nagalievska", "ForeName": "Mariia R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Center for Cryptogamic Plants and Fungi, Department of Evolutionary and Environmental Biology and Institute of Evolution, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Haifa, Mount Carmel, Haifa 31905, Israel."}], "LastName": "Wasser", "ForeName": "Solomon P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biology, Ivan Franko National University of Lviv, Lviv, Ukraine, 4 Hrushevsky St., Lviv 79005, Ukraine."}], "LastName": "Sybirna", "ForeName": "Nataliya O", "Initials": "NO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Med Mushrooms", "NlmUniqueID": "100886202", "ISSNLinking": "1940-4344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycated Hemoglobin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, HDL"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reishi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycated Hemoglobin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperglycemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, HDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dyslipidemias"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agaricales"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "5"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37183916", "10.1615/IntJMedMushrooms.2023047834", "3eb4f7215a4b8ea4,233db4673fabd698"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
