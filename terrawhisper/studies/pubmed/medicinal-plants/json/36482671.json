Allopurinol, benzbromarone, and febuxostat, which are available in the market, have reduced the circulating urate levels; however, they exhibit serious side effects. Therefore, it is reasonable to develop a new active antihyperuricemia drug with few side effects. With the deepening of research, numerous kinds of literature have shown that natural active substances are effective in the treatment of hyperuricemia with a variety of sources and few side effects, which have become the focus of research in recent years. This review focuses on natural active substances with uric-acid-reducing activity and discusses their pharmacological effects. More specifically, the bioactive compounds of natural active substances are divided into five categories: natural extracts, monomer compounds extracted from plants, natural protease hydrolysates, peptides, and probiotic bacteria. In addition, the mechanisms by which these bioactive compounds exhibit hypouricemic effects can be divided into four classes: inhibition of key enzyme activities, promotion of uric acid excretion and inhibition of reabsorption in the kidney, promotion of decomposing uric acid precursors, and promotion of decomposing uric acid. Overall, this current and comprehensive review examines the role of natural active substances in the treatment of hyperuricemia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4603-0347"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Pharmacy, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100102, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Pharmacy, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100102, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center of GAP for Chinese Crude Drugs, Ministry of Education, Beijing 100102, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Junling", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center of GAP for Chinese Crude Drugs, Ministry of Education, Beijing 100102, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wenquan", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "268B43MJ25", "NameOfSubstance": "Uric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "101V0R1N2E", "NameOfSubstance": "Febuxostat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "63CZ7GJN5I", "NameOfSubstance": "Allopurinol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.17.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthine Oxidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperuricemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Uric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Febuxostat"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allopurinol"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthine Oxidase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36482671", "10.1021/acs.jafc.2c06554"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
