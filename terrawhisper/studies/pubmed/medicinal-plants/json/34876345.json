Therefore, a new method was proposed for predicting the inhibitory activity on \u03b1-Glucosidase of Coreopsis tinctoria extract based on near infrared spectroscopy. The absorbance of the inhibitory system was measured by ultraviolet spectroscopy, which was used to study the inhibitory activity on a-glucosidase of Coreopsis tinctoria extract. The near infrared spectra of the solid samples were collected. By selecting spectral preprocessing and optimizing spectral bands, a rapid prediction model of the inhibitory activity was established by partial least squares regression. The root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV), correlation coefficient (R) value and the ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD) value were used as indicators of the evaluation model. The near infrared spectrum model was established by combining the best spectral preprocessing of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and the best spectral band. The root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) of this model was 0.815%, the correlation coefficient (R) value was 0.942, and the ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD) was 3.0. The root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of the model by prediction set was 0.819%, the correlation coefficient (R) value was 0.950, and the RPD was 3.2. The model shows that the fitting relationship between the predicted inhibition value and the reference inhibition value of the near infrared spectral model is good. The results showed that there was a good correlation between near infrared spectroscopy and the inhibitory activity of Coreopsis tinctoria extract. Thus, the established model was robust and effective and could be used for rapid quantification of \u03b1-Glucosidase inhibitory activity. The prediction method is simple and rapid, and can be extended to study the inhibition of other medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
