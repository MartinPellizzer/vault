The structures and absolute configurations of new compounds were established based on analyses of spectroscopic data, ECD calculations, and single crystal X-ray crystallography. Thalidelavines A-E (1-5) were structurally complex bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids with various configurations. These isolated alkaloids were evaluated for their cytotoxic and immunosuppressive effects. Among them, both 9 and 10 displayed significant cytotoxicities against T98G cell lines with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 2.1\u00a0\u03bcM, compared with the positive CPT-11 (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a03.0\u00a0\u03bcM). In addition, 5-7 showed remarkable immunosuppressive effects. These findings not only enrich the structural diversity of bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids, but also provide potential candidates for the further development of the antitumor and immunosuppressive agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
