Bringing an industrial wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) into compliance with European directives requires a thorough analysis of the effluent. In this study, we demonstrate how online comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (on-line LC \u00d7 LC) hyphenated to high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) can be a powerful analytical methodology to monitoring the outlet water, by analysing the content of known molecules while characterizing unknown compounds. Reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) was used in both dimensions, with a penta-fluoro-phenyl silica-based column at neutral pH in the first dimension (<sup>1</sup>D) and a C18 column at acidic pH in the second one (<sup>2</sup>D). The conditions were optimized for a total analysis time of 60\u00a0min. The variability of both retention times and peak areas was evaluated. The average standard deviation on retention times was found to be less than 0.1\u00a0s in <sup>2</sup>D. The relative standard deviation on peak area was about 7% for run-to-run analysis. This analytical approach, applied to the pharmaceutical effluents before (inlet) and after (outlet) wastewater treatment permitted to detect 240 compounds. These included 27 priority pharmaceutical products, 8 of which were of very high priority and their concentrations could be compared to target values. The comparison of 2D-LC and 1D-LC approaches clearly highlights the power of on-line RPLC x RPLC technique, which allows both targeted quantitative analysis and non-targeted qualitative analysis of pharmaceutical effluents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
