However, long-term residue changes and profiles of PCBs in cetaceans have not been extensively studied in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), an important marine mammal area in China. Here, the body burdens, spatiotemporal trends, and health risks of 21 chlorobiphenyl congeners (\u221121CBs) were analyzed in blubber samples collected from twelve cetacean species (n = 172) in the PRE from 2003 to 2020. Our results revealed medium levels of PCBs (316-96,233 ng g<sup>-1</sup> lipid) compared to those reported for cetaceans elsewhere (70-370,000 ng g<sup>-1</sup> lipid). Clear differences in PCB distribution patterns between inshore and offshore cetaceans and between odontocetes and mysticetes were also found. Both the coastal Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) and Indo-Pacific finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides) displayed similarly fine-scale spatial distribution patterns of PCBs, suggesting that the two cetaceans could serve as bioindicators of PCB pollution in the PRE. Additionally, both cetaceans exhibited decreasing trends in their blubber PCB concentrations over the past 20 years, likely reflecting the effective regulation of PCBs in the PRE Delta. Nevertheless, the relatively high and stable PCB-toxic equivalent (TEQ) levels detected in calf humpback dolphins during the sampling period suggested that the calves are still under the stresses of high PCB-related health risks. Our results highlight the need for more efforts to eliminate PCB contamination to prevent these cetaceans from continuous population decline and further extinction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
