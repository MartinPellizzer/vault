Tedious extraction procedures are usually involved in liquid chromatography-based chemical analysis of herbal medicines (HMs), resulting in extensive consumptions of organic solvents, time, energy, and materials, as well as the significant chemical degradation risks for those labile compounds. Fortunately, an emerging online pressurized liquid extraction (OLE, also known as online liquid extraction) technique has been developed for the achievement of directly chemical analysis for solid matrices in recent years, and in a short period, this versatile technique has been widely applied for the chemical analysis of HMs. In the present mini-review, we aim to briefly summarize the principles, the instrumentation, along with the application progress of this robust and flexible extraction technique in the latest six years, and the emerging challenges and future prospects are discussed as well. Special attention is paid onto the hyphenation of the versatile OLE module with LC-MS instrument. The described information is expected to introduce a promising OLE approach and to provide the guidance for the achievement of directly chemical analysis of, but not limited to, HMs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
