In this investigation, we compared the pharmacological effects of these compounds as potential cardiotonic agents using the spontaneously beating atria model.", "In each experiment, rats were treated with reserpine. The atrium was isolated and mounted in an organ bath. We assessed chronotropic and inotropic effects using cumulative log concentration-response curves of isoprenaline alone or in combination of each test-compound.", "Majority of test compounds augment atria contraction force (ACF) significantly but with different potencies on atrium contraction rate. Cilostamide, MCPIP ([4-(4-methyl piperazin-1-yl)-4-oxobutoxy)-4-methylquinolin-2(1H)-one]), methyl carbostyril compounds- (mc1), mc2 and mc5 increased the isoprenaline effect on ACF synergistically. But, mc6 failed to potentiate the effect of isoprenalin; mc3 and mc4 did not increase ACF, which may be because of their higher hydrophilic nature. It was interesting that mc2, alone or in combination with isoprenaline, produced the highest inotropic effect while it did not affect the basal contraction rate and almost blocked the isoprenaline chronotropic effect.", "Combination of mc2 with isoprenaline had synergistic effect on inotropic effect, but this combination reduced isoprenaline chronotropic effect; therefore, these effects cannot be related to reducing B-adrenergic receptors activity. These compounds showed different effects; probably all of them were not mediated via PDE3 inhibition and other mechanisms are involving."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Azar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shafiee-Nick", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Sciences, School of Paramedical Sciences, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghian", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Parsaee", "ForeName": "Heydar", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Iran J Basic Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101517966", "ISSNLinking": "2008-3866"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Fischemister R, Castro L, Abi-Gerges A, Rochais F, Jurevicius J.
