It has been suggested that antioxidant nutrients are protective against degenerative diseases. So we have studied the antioxidant effect of oils isolated from onion and garlic on nicotine-induced lipid peroxidation in rat tissues. The lipid peroxidation products and scavenging enzymes were assessed in liver, lungs, heart and kidney. The rats were treated with 0.6 mg nicotine/kg bw and simultaneously given 100 mg garlic or onion oils/kg bw for 21 d. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, conjugated dienes and hydroperoxides concentrations were significantly increased in the tissues of nicotine-treated rats. Both the garlic oil and onion oil supplementation to nicotine-treated rats increased resistance to lipid peroxidation. The activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase decreased in nicotine-treated rats, but there was a trend to increased glutathione content. With garlic oil or onion oil supplementation, nicotine-treated rats had increased activities of antioxidant enzymes and increased concentrations of glutathione. These results indicate that oils of garlic and onion are effective antioxidants against the oxidative damage caused by nicotine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Kerala, Kariavattom, India."}], "LastName": "Helen", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rajasree", "ForeName": "C R", "Initials": "CR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Krishnakumar", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Augusti", "ForeName": "K T", "Initials": "KT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vijayammal", "ForeName": "P L", "Initials": "PL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Vet Hum Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7704194", "ISSNLinking": "0145-6296"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nicotinic Agonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbiturates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6M3C89ZY6R", "NameOfSubstance": "Nicotine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M1YZW5SS7C", "NameOfSubstance": "thiobarbituric acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotine"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotinic Agonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Onions"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbiturates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10509436"]}}]}
