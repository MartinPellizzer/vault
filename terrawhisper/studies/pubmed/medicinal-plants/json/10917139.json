The goal of this study was to determine whether oral administration of P. paniculata inhibits development of spontaneous leukemia. Four-week-old female AKR/J mice were given oral doses of powdered roots from P. paniculata three times weekly for 8 weeks; controls received phosphate-buffered saline. Enlargement of thymic lymphoma in the mice treated with P. paniculata was significantly suppressed, as compared with controls (128 +/- 67.3 mg versus 219.9 +/- 84.2 mg, respectively; P < .01); proliferation of endogenous recombinant murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) in the thymus was markedly inhibited after the first oral treatment as compared with untreated controls (final age, 28 weeks; P < .05). In normal 3-week-old female AKR/J mice, mortality from thymic lymphoma was delayed markedly after injection into the thymus of cell-free extract of thymus from the experimental female 28-week-old AKR/J mice that received the oral P. paniculata preparation. These results suggest that the agent's suppressive effects on spontaneously occurring leukemia caused by endogenous recombinant MuLV in female AKR/J mice may depend on enhancement of nonspecific immune or cellular immune systems (or both) by the P. paniculata preparation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Research and Development, Mie Karyo (Mie Chemical Foods) Company, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watanabe", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watanabe", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watanabe", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hotta", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Detect Prev", "NlmUniqueID": "7704778", "ISSNLinking": "0361-090X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia Virus, Murine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred AKR"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Thymus Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10917139"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
