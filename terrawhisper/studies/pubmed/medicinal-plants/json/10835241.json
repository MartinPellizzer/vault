The working volume of the culture vessel was 4.4 L with an aspect ratio of 1.7. Medium was dispersed as a spray onto the top of the root bed, and the roots grew radially outward from the central mesh cylinder to the vessel wall. Significant benefits in terms of liquid drainage and reduced interstitial liquid holdup were obtained using a vertical rather than horizontal support structure for the biomass and by operating the reactor with cocurrent air and liquid flow. With root growth, a pattern of spatial heterogeneity developed in the vessel. Higher local biomass densities, lower volumes of interstitial liquid, lower sugar concentrations, and higher root atropine contents were found in the upper sections of the root bed compared with the lower sections, suggesting a greater level of metabolic activity toward the top of the reactor. Although gas-liquid oxygen transfer to the spray droplets was very rapid, there was evidence of significant oxygen limitations in the reactor. Substantial volumes of non-free-draining interstitial liquid accumulated in the root bed. Roots near the bottom of the vessel trapped up to 3-4 times their own weight in liquid, thus eliminating the advantages of improved contact with the gas phase offered by liquid-dispersed culture systems. Local nutrient and product concentrations in the non-free-draining liquid were significantly different from those in the bulk medium, indicating poor liquid mixing within the root bed. Oxygen enrichment of the gas phase improved neither growth nor atropine production, highlighting the greater importance of liquid-solid compared with gas-liquid oxygen transfer resistance. The absence of mechanical or pneumatic agitation and the tendency of the root bed to accumulate liquid and impede drainage were identified as the major limitations to reactor performance. Improved reactor operating strategies and selection or development of root lines offering minimal resistance to liquid flow and low liquid retention characteristics are possible solutions to these problems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, University of New South Wales, Sydney NSW 2052, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "G R", "Initials": "GR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Doran", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Prog", "NlmUniqueID": "8506292", "ISSNLinking": "1520-6033"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "7C0697DR9I", "NameOfSubstance": "Atropine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Atropa belladonna"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Atropine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10835241", "10.1021/bp0000306", "bp0000306"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
