Based on the initial data, the sesame flour was supplemented with other meals: \"carioca\" beans, pigeon pea, and soybean. Nine diets were prepared and the best combination was that of 50% sesame flour protein and 50% pigeon pea, the PER of which was 2.28. Breads were made with these systems, as follows: 100% sesame flour, 100% wheat flour, 50% sesame flour + 50% wheat flour; 30% sesame flour + 70% wheat flour; 30% sesame flour + 30% soybean flour + 40% wheat flour. These were evaluated through sensory analysis by a grading system. Good acceptance was obtained with the bread prepared with 30% sesame flour + 70% wheat flour. Its external and internal appearance, as well as its organoleptic characteristics were close to the bread, with 100% wheat flour. Sesame flour at the 50% proportion gave a bread of medium quality. The protein mixtures of sesame flour and soybean flour were well accepted. Some of the panel members reported that it had a taste somewhat like integral bread."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Escola Superior de Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil."}], "LastName": "Salgado", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gon\u00e7alves", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Estudo da semente de gergelim (Sesamum indicum, L.)
