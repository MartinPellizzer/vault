The composition of these danshen samples was analyzed using HPLC. Specifically, the amounts of magnesium tanshinoate B (MTB), danshensu, isotanshinone HA, and cryptotanshinone were determined. In some of these samples, the content of MTB was further confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS)/MS method.", "There were great variations in the amount of the four active ingredients in the commercially available danshen crude drugs and drug preparations in this study. The amount of MTB was the highest among the four components measured in the crude drugs. However, the amounts of MTB in all danshen preparations were much lower than those in crude drugs. The 2 lipophilic components, isotanshinone HA and cryptotanshinone, were very low or not detectable in both injection and oral preparations.", "MTB can be used to standardize the various forms of danshen crude drugs and drug preparations from different sources. In view of the variation in the amounts of MTB and other components, improvement in the production methods of danshen preparations is essential to ensure consistent amount of its active ingredients and reproducible pharmacological actions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Xu Hui District Central Hospital, 966 Huai Hai Zhong Road, Shanghai 200031."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Jing-Ying", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leung", "ForeName": "Susan Wai Sum", "Initials": "SW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Siow", "ForeName": "Yaw Loong", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Man", "ForeName": "Ricky Ying Keung", "Initials": "RY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Da-Yuan", "Initials": "DY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenanthrolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tablets"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4GF33A5PAJ", "NameOfSubstance": "3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5E9SXT166N", "NameOfSubstance": "cryptotanshinone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8V4R1E4C5Y", "NameOfSubstance": "magnesium tanshinoate B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I38ZP9992A", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lactates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenanthrolines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tablets"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12466055"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
