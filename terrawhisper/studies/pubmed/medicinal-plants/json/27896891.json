Epidemiological studies suggest that polyphenolic compounds contribute for prevention or treatment of several cancers particularly melanoma. Such findings motivate to dig out novel therapeutic strategies against melanoma, including research toward the development of new chemotherapeutic and biologic agents that can target the tumor cells by different mechanisms. Recently, it has been found that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is activated in many cancer cases surprisingly. Different evidences supply the aspect that STAT3 activation plays a vital role in the metastasis, including proliferation of cells, survival, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis. This significant feature plays a vital role in various cellular processes, such as cell proliferation and survival. Here, we reviewed the mechanisms of the STAT3 pathway regulation and their role in promoting melanoma. Also, we have evaluated the emerging data on polyphenols (PPs) specifically their contribution in melanoma therapies with an emphasis on their regulatory/inhibitory actions in relation to STAT3 pathway and current progress in the development of phytochemical therapeutic techniques. An understanding of targeting STAT3 by PPs brings an opportunity to melanoma therapy. \u00a9 2016 BioFactors, 43(3):347-370, 2017."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 International Union of
