The phytochemistry and pharmacology of Paulownia flowers contribute to their economic uses in medicines, foods, animal feeds, and cosmetics. The chemical composition of Paulownia flowers is mostly flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, terpenoids, volatile components, polysaccharides, lignans, and iridoids, which exhibit various health benefits, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, anticancer, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, neuroprotective and immunoregulation activities. Moreover, the extracts of the Paulownia flower have been proven safe for animals. These promote the development of new products and technologies using Paulownia flowers, with intellectual property rights. The review presents the current developments on the chemical composition, biological and pharmacological activities, and economic values of Paulownia flowers, and aims to provide a reference for their further utilization."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
