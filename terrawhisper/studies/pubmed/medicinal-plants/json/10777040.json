A total of 542 cows were examined for endometritis 22 to 28 days postpartum and assigned to one of three treatment groups: in group 1 the cows with signs of endometritis were treated with an intrauterine infusion of 100 ml of a 2 per cent polycondensated m-cresolsulphuric acid formaldehyde solution; in group 2 the cows with signs of endometritis were treated with an intrauterine infusion of 125 ml of a 20 per cent eucalyptus compositum solution; and in group 3 all the cows were injected intramuscularly with 0.75 mg of tiaprost, an analogue of prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha) at two-week intervals, starting on day 43, until they were inseminated. Thirty-four per cent of the cows showed signs of endometritis. In group 3, oestrus detection efficiency was significantly higher than in groups 1 and 2 (P<0.05), the interval to first service was shorter, and the cows had fewer days open than the cows in groups 1 and 2 (P<0.05). The results indicate that management programmes based on the strategic use of PGF2alpha are an effective alternative to traditional programmes based on rectal palpations and intrauterine infusions to control endometritis at a herd level."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Production Medicine, Clinic of Reproduction, Free University of Berlin, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heuwieser", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tenhagen", "ForeName": "B A", "Initials": "BA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tischer", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00fchr", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blum", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Vet Rec", "NlmUniqueID": "0031164", "ISSNLinking": "0042-4900"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cresols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Luteolytic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Prostaglandins F, Synthetic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiophenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "62251-61-0", "NameOfSubstance": "tiaprost"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Husbandry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cresols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dairying"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "prevention & control", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Endometritis"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Eucalyptus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Luteolytic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Prostaglandins F, Synthetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Thiophenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10777040", "10.1136/vr.146.12.338"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
