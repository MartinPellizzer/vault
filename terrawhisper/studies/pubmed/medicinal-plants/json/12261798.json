Observers comment on the health delivery system in China. It is remarkable that, without expensive technology, complex health facilities, and highly trained personnel, China has been able to reduce its death rate substantially in recent years. Reduction of the infant and child mortality rates has encouraged people to practice family planning with assurance that their children will survive to adulthood. The following 2 factors have been responsible for the improvements in the Chinese health delivery system: 1) use of barefoot doctors and other health outreach personnel working at the community level; and 2) use of a combination of traditional Chinese medicine, e.g., acupuncture and herbal medicines, with techniques imported from the West, e.g., X-ray and modern drugs. Often Western methods are used for diagnosis and traditional medicines for treatment. Research into the method of action of traditional medicines is ongoing. Family planning is seen at every level of health service provision. Barefoot doctors actually bring contraceptives to the people at their homes or work places. Family planning services and supplies are free. Provision of supplies is accomplished by minimally trained personnel with referral to more trained people available when necessary."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["800673", "00076499"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: Draper Fund Report"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Acupuncture", "Asia", "Barefoot Doctors", "China", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Eastern Asia", "Family Planning", "Health", "Health Personnel", "Plants, Medicinal", "Population Growth"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12261798", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1980", "Month": "09", "Day": "08"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "07"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0191-3905", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "8", "PubDate": {"Year": "1980", "Month": "Mar"}}, "Title": "Draper Fund report", "ISOAbbreviation": "Draper Fund Rep"}, "ArticleTitle": "Health services and the family planning component.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "5", "EndPage": "9", "MedlinePgn": "5-9"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Epstein", "ForeName": "S G", "Initials": "SG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "P C", "Initials": "PC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grant", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Duke", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guttmacher", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oakley", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Draper Fund Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "7901101", "ISSNLinking": "0191-3905"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acupuncture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Community Health Workers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Family Planning Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia, Eastern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Growth"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12261798"]}}]}
