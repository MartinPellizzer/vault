Aberrant metabolism, a key hallmark of human cancers, plays a crucial role in tumor progression, therapeutic responses and TNBC-related death. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we delineate a previously unrecognized role of aberrant glucose metabolism in regulating the turnover of Snail1, which is a key transcriptional factor of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and critically contributes to the acquisition of stemness, metastasis and chemo-resistance. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), when activated in response to glucose deprivation, directly phosphorylates Snail1 at Ser11. Such a phosphorylation modification of Snail1 facilitates its recruitment of the E3 ligase FBXO11 and promotes its degradation, thereby suppressing stemness, metastasis and increasing cellular sensitivity to chemotherapies in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, histological analyses reveal a negative correlation between p-AMPK\u03b1 and Snail1 in TNBC specimens. Taken together, our findings establish a novel mechanism and functional significance of AMPK in linking glucose status to Snail1-dependent malignancies and underscore the potential of AMPK agonists as a promising therapeutic strategy in the management of TNBC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
