Based on the knowledge of Colombian indigenous communities, we collected extracts of plants with potential antimalarial effects from the middle Vaup\u00e9s region.", "To evaluate the mutagenic and genotoxic effects, as well as the gene expression of Rad51C, Xiap, P53 and Nrf2 induced by four ethanolic extracts with antimalarial activity (R001, T002, T015 and T028).", "We evaluated four ethanolic extracts with antimalarial activity using the Ames test to assess mutagenicity, and the comet assay on HepG2 cells to determine the genotoxicicity. We also evaluated the expression of Rad51C, Xiap, P53 and Nrf2 from HepG2 cells stimulated with the four extracts.", "None of the four extracts was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 strain in the presence and absence of S9 metabolic activity. Extracts R001, T015 and T028 were weakly mutagenic on the TA100 strain in the presence of S9, with mutagenic indexes (MI) of 1.58, 1.53 and 1.61, respectively. The T015 strain showed the same behavior without S9 with an MI of 1.36. The results of the comet assay showed that the four extracts produced category 1 or 2 damage, with comets between 36.7 and 51.48 \u03bcm in length. However, the genetic damage index suggested that most of the cells were affected by the treatments. Regarding gene expression, extracts R001 and T028 induced an overexpression of genes Xiap and P53 with an 1.84 to 3.99 fold-change compared with untreated cells.", "These results revealed that the T002 extract was the safest as it had antimalarial activity and was not cytotoxic on HepG2 cells. Moreover, it was not mutagenic and it only produced category 1 damage on the DNA. Also, the extract did not induce a change in the expression of the tested genes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Grupo de Malaria, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Antioquia, Medell\u00edn, Colombia Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Fundaci\u00f3n Universitaria Mar\u00eda Cano, Medell\u00edn, Colombia. claudiavivianabm@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Barbosa", "ForeName": "Claudia Viviana", "Initials": "CV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Muskus", "ForeName": "Carlos Enrique", "Initials": "CE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Orozco", "ForeName": "Luz Yaneth", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pab\u00f3n", "ForeName": "Adriana", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Colombia", "MedlineTA": "Biomedica", "NlmUniqueID": "8205605", "ISSNLinking": "0120-4157"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimalarials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA-Binding Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-E2-Related Factor 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NFE2L2 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RAD51C protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "TP53 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "XIAP protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Activation, Metabolic"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimalarials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colombia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Comet Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA-Binding Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hep G2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "NF-E2-Related Factor 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plasmodium falciparum"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28968015", "10.7705/biomedica.v37i3.3239"]}}]}
