This group of viruses is named so as they exhibit characteristic crown-like spikes on their protein coat. SARS-CoV-2, a type of coronavirus that emerged in 2019, causes severe infection in the lower respiratory tract of humans and is often fatal in immunocompromised individuals. No medications have been approved so far for the direct treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the currently available treatment options rely on relieving the symptoms. The medicinal plants occurring in nature serve as a rich source of active ingredients that could be utilized for developing pharmacopeial and non-pharmacopeial/synthetic drugs with antiviral properties. Compounds obtained from certain plants have been used for directly and selectively inhibiting different coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. The present review discusses the potential natural inhibitors against the highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, with a systematic elaboration on the possible mechanisms of action of these natural compounds while acting in the different stages of the life cycle of coronaviruses. Moreover, through a comprehensive exploration of the existing literature in this regard, the importance of such compounds in the research and development of effective and safe antiviral agents is discussed. We focused on the mechanism of action of several natural compounds along with their target of action. In addition, the immunomodulatory effects of these active components in the context of human health are elucidated. Finally, it is suggested that the use of traditional medicinal plants is a novel and feasible remedial strategy against human coronaviruses."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur, India."}], "LastName": "Guguloth", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur, India."}], "LastName": "Lakshmi", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur, India."}], "LastName": "Rajendran", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur, India."}], "LastName": "Rajaram", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pondicherry University, Puducherry, India."}], "LastName": "Chinnasamy", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Sciences, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "J-D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Medicine, Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology and BJM School of Biosciences, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India."}], "LastName": "Senapati", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur, India."}], "LastName": "Durairajan", "ForeName": "S S K", "Initials": "SSK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "100960531", "ISSNLinking": "1389-4501"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19 Drug Treatment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "41"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34636297", "10.2174/1389450122666211005115313", "CDT-EPUB-118306"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
