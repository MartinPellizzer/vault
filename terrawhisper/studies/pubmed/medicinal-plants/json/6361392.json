By reference to the genetic code the aminoacyl sequence of histones H2A, H4, H3, H2B and H1 (fragment) were rewritten as the codon sequences. The N-terminal regions were set aside on the grounds of different composition and sequence. The remainder of the molecule could be referred to simple repeat-tetrapeptide proteins by codon composition (high Gxy, low xGy content) and by sequence. Random segments of three to six residues occur characterized by composition and sequence as originating from the complimentary DNA strand, i.e. as codon \"transcript\". Ancestral features are probably best seen in H3, point mutations appear to be more extensive in H2B and H1. Segments in reverse order in H2A and in \"transcript\" in H4 distinguish these two from the other three histones. There is a tenuous possibility the N-terminals also originated as repeat-tetrapeptide now intensively modified. At codon-level the 50S ribosomal protein (L7/L12) of E. coli has features in common with histones (including a palindrome-containing N-terminal). It has the composition and sequence of a well-conserved tetrapeptide-repeat strand (statistical support). If interpretations made here are substantially correct, the 50S r-protein illustrates a significant stage in evolution of histone codon strands."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "A P", "Initials": "AP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Theor Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376342", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5193"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Codon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Histones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribosomal Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Codon"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Code"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Histones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ribosomal Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "10", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6361392", "10.1016/0022-5193(83)90114-5", "0022-5193(83)90114-5"]}}]}
