Therefore, we aimed to assess the influence of 70% v/v hydro-ethanolic extract of the aerial parts of <i>R.\u00a0officinalis</i> against postoperative abdominal adhesions in a rat model. Forty-eight male Wistar rats (190\u2009\u00b1\u200920\u2009g) were divided into six groups of eight: group 1\u00a0= normal group, without any surgical procedures, group 2 = control group, group 3 = vehicle group, and groups 3, 4, and 5\u00a0= experimental groups receiving 2\u2009mL of 4, 2, or 1% w/v <i>R.\u00a0officinalis</i> treatment. Adhesion levels were macroscopically examined. Additionally, the levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, interleukin-1<i>\u03b2</i>, and TNF-<i>\u03b1</i>), growth factors (transforming growth factor-<i>\u03b2</i>1, and vascular endothelial growth factor), oxidative (NO, nitric oxide and MDA, malondialdehyde), and antioxidative (GSH, glutathione) factors were evaluated. Our results revealed that the adhesion score, interleukin-6, interleukin-1<i>\u03b2</i>, TNF-<i>\u03b1</i>, transforming growth factor-<i>\u03b2</i>1, vascular endothelial growth factor, NO, and MDA levels were significantly increased in the vehicle group, while the GSH level was diminished. <i>R.\u00a0officinalis</i> treatment notably ameliorated the adhesion score following postoperative abdominal adhesions compared with the vehicle group. Our results also revealed that <i>R.\u00a0officinalis</i> markedly reduced inflammatory cytokines, oxidative factors, fibrosis, and angiogenesis biomarkers, whereas it increased the antioxidative factor. Therefore, <i>R.\u00a0officinalis</i> may be a potential candidate for the management of postoperative peritoneal adhesion."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Roohbakhsh", "ForeName": "Yasamin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Baradaran Rahimi", "ForeName": "Vafa", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Silakhori", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rajabi", "ForeName": "Hamed", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rahmanian-Devin", "ForeName": "Pouria", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Zabol, Zabol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Samzadeh-Kermani", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rakhshandeh", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hasanpour", "ForeName": "Maede", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Iranshahi", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Toxicology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mousavi", "ForeName": "Seyed Hadi", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Askari", "ForeName": "Vahid Reza", "Initials": "VR"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "National Institute for Medical Research Development", "Agency": "971206", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peritoneal Lavage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rosmarinus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Adhesions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32097974", "10.1055/a-1118-3918"]}}]}
