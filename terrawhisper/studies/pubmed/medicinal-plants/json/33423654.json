Medicinal plants were used for the separation and isolation of pure phytochemical and some of the best examples are tubocurarine, aspirin, morphine, digoxin, atropine, quinine and reserpine. Phytoconstituents are pure, plant-derived, natural chemicals found to be present in medicinal plants and examples are flavonoids, alkaloids and phenolic compounds, etc. In modern medicine, there has been a global growth of herbal medicines due to their nutrition, physical effectiveness and pharmacological activities. Plants have been used in the traditional medicines and modern drug discoveries program. In order to investigate the biological potential of poncirin in modern medicine, here, different scientific data have been analyzed in the present investigation through various literature sources. Detailed pharmacological activities of poncirin were also investigated in the present investigation to reveal the medicinal properties of poncirin in medicine and other allied health sectors. Analytical techniques used for the isolation of poncirin from various medicinal plants have been also presented in this study. Poncirin is a flavanone glycoside found to be present in the Poncirus trifoliata and Citrus reticulate having a bitter taste. The biological importance of poncirin for their anti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of PGE2 and IL-6 production has been investigated in the scientific field. The biological importance of poncirin against bacterial, viral infections, gastric disease and human gastric cancer has been investigated in medicine. Pharmacological data analysis revealed the biological application of poncirin against bone loss, inflammation, colitis, human gastric cancer, gastritis, liver injury and Alzheimer's disease. From the analysis of the presented scientific information of poncirin, it was found that poncirin has significant biological activities and health benefits in the modern health sectors for the treatment of human health complications and could be used as a drug in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences Naini, Prayagraj, 211007, Uttar Pradesh,India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Dinesh Kumar", "Initials": "DK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "101269157", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8MUY4P95B4", "NameOfSubstance": "poncirin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Citrus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33423654", "10.2174/1871530321666210108122924", "EMIDDT-EPUB-113139"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
