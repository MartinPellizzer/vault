Britton var. crispa (Thunb.) H. Deane, is traditionally cultivated as an edible/medicinal crop in East Asia. Its essential oil contains many bioactive compounds that are expected to have high pharmacological functionality, as well as antimicrobial and insecticidal activity. Spider mites are a major pest group for perilla cultivation. The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, possesses divergent detoxification enzymes and has developed resistance against most acaricides. The essential oil content of perilla halves from the pre-flowering phase to the flowering phase, and ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation generally increases defense compounds. To clarify the effects of this change in essential oil content and the effects of UV-B pretreatment, we investigated the developmental success and egg production of T. urticae on leaves from the preflowering and flowering phases cultivated with and without nighttime UV-B irradiation. Both the parameters significantly increased on leaves from the flowering phase in comparison with that from the preflowering phase, suggesting that constitutively produced essential oil provided protection against mite pests in a growth phase-specific manner. The defense system also extended the developmental period of mites on red perilla leaves, but not on green perilla leaves, in preflowering phase. Although egg production was lower on red perilla leaves pretreated with UV-B, no negative effects were caused on the developmental success and duration on red and green perilla and the egg production on green perilla by UV-B pretreatment. Our findings reveal a significant impact of investment allocation of perilla plants and a small contribution of UV-B irradiation to the plant defense system."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.
