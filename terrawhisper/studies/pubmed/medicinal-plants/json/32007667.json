Meyer), notoginseng (Panax notoginseng) and American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.), attracts research focus. Actually, the biological and pharmacological effects of the Panax genus are mainly attributed to the abundant ginsenosides. However, the low membrane permeability and the gastrointestinal tract influence seriously limit the absorption and bioavailability of ginsenosides. The acid or base hydrolysates of ginsenosides, 20 (R,S)-panaxadiol and 20 (R,S)-protopanaxadiol showed improved bioavailability and diverse pharmacological activities. Moreover, relative stable skeletons and active hydroxyl group at C-3 position and other reactive sites are suitable for structural modification to improve biological activities. In this review, the pharmacological activities of panaxadiol, protopanaxadiol and their structurally modified derivatives are comprehensively summarized."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.
