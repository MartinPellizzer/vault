The product claims to improve immunity against common infection and body functioning. The present study was initiated to analyze the chemical constituents of the Carica Seed Extract and determine the potential immunomodulatory properties of the different bioactive fractions. These immunomodulatory activities of crude Carica Seed Extract and its bioactive fractions were examined in vitro using lymphocyte proliferation assays and complement-mediated hemolytic assay. Three major observations were made in this study: (1) the crude Carica Seed Extract and two other bioactive fractions significantly enhanced the phytohemagglutinin responsiveness of lymphocytes; (2) none of the Carica Seed Extract (at the concentrations used in this study) was able to protect the lymphocytes from the toxic effects of chromium; and (3) some of the bioactive fractions of Carica Seed Extract were able to significantly inhibit the classical complement-mediated hemolytic pathway. These findings provide evidence for immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory actions of Carica Seed Extract. No single compound is likely responsible for these activities. Further purification, isolation and characterization of the active components are needed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of the Philippines, College of Medicine, Manila, Philippines. mpmojica@cm1.upm.edu.ph"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mojica-Henshaw", "ForeName": "Mariluz P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Francisco", "ForeName": "Angelica D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De Guzman", "ForeName": "Florecita", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tigno", "ForeName": "Xenia T", "Initials": "XT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Clin Hemorheol Microcirc", "NlmUniqueID": "9709206", "ISSNLinking": "1386-0291"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0R0008Q3JB", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Chromium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complement Hemolytic Activity Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Complement Pathway, Classical"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14724345"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
