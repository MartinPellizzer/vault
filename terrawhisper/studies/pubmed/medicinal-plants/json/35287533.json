Maxim., a traditional medicinal plant in Asia, is widely used in clinical settings but its safety <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> is unclear. This study investigated the sub-chronic toxicity of <i>E. sagittatum</i> aqueous extract to rats with a 13-week daily intragastric administration of 7.5, 15, or 30\u2009g/kg. Nine constituents of the aqueous extract were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). Organ weights, organ coefficients, serum biochemistry parameters, histopathology, and metabolomic analysis were performed. In female rats, treatment increased the liver, thymus, and adrenal gland coefficients (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). Liver, pancreas, and adrenal gland injury were observed. The levels of six metabolites were altered by the treatment (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). In male rats, treatment altered liver, heart, and thymus coefficients (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05) and liver, adrenal gland, and heart injury were observed. The levels of 11 metabolites were altered (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). The no-observed-adverse-effect level was not determined but would be below 7.5\u2009g/kg in rats treated for 13\u2009weeks. In female rats, <i>E. sagittatum</i> may injure the liver and pancreas and dysregulate the biosynthesis of phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, valine, leucine, and isoleucine and the metabolism of phenylalanine. In male rats, the extract may injure the liver and adrenal gland and dysregulate the biosynthesis of valine, leucine, and isoleucine and the metabolism of pyruvate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine Pharmacology, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Component-Based Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, PR China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yating", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhai", "ForeName": "Yuxia", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, PR China."}], "LastName": "Huo", "ForeName": "Xiangxiang", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, PR China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Mengying", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine Pharmacology, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, PR China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine Pharmacology, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Component-Based Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, PR China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Yingli", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine Pharmacology, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Component-Based Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine Pharmacology, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Component-Based Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "04Y7590D77", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoleucine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GMW67QNF9C", "NameOfSubstance": "Leucine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Epimedium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isoleucine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leucine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "35"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35287533", "10.1080/01480545.2022.2050749"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
