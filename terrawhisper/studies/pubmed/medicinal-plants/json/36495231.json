Pancreatic lipase is a lipid-digesting enzyme that plays an important role in fat metabolism. Inhibiting pancreatic lipase is an attractive target for obesity treatment. Phytochemicals or bioactive compounds/extracts isolated from medicinal plants offer a promising platform for the development of pancreatic lipase inhibitors. This study aims to characterize and investigate the effect of aloenin A, glycoside found in Aloe vera, as a possible inhibitor of pancreatic lipase in vitro and in silico. A. vera extract had an IC50 value of 0.5472\u2009\u03bcg/ml, whereas aloenin A had an IC50 value of 14.95\u2009\u03bcg/mL and was found to inhibit in a competitive manner. These findings were supported by molecular docking studies, which revealed that aloenin A binds to the substrate binding site with a binding energy of\u2009-\u20097.16\u2009kcal/mol, and this binding site is stabilized by three hydrogen bonds contributed by Phe<sup>77</sup> and Asp<sup>79</sup> . Our findings suggest that the anti-hyperlipidemic effects of A. vera on pancreatic lipase can be attributed in part to the presence of aloenin A."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Bio-Separation Technology, Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Deora", "ForeName": "Neha", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Bio-Separation Technology, Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Venkatraman", "ForeName": "Krishnan", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Mol Recognit", "NlmUniqueID": "9004580", "ISSNLinking": "0952-3499"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "38412-46-3", "NameOfSubstance": "aloenin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.3", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aloe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Hurt RT, Kulisek C, Buchanan LA, McClave SA.
