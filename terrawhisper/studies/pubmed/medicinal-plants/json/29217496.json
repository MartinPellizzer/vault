However, its protective effect against renal ischaemia/reperfusion, the major cause of acute kidney injury, has never been studied. Moreover, no comprehensive chemical profiling of its extracts was recorded.", "Assessment of the protective effect of the plant extracts against renal ischaemia/reperfusion and elucidation of the possible mechanism of action. Then, to determine its bioactive constituents using modern UPLC-HRMS technique.", "Unilateral ischaemia was induced by clamping the left renal artery for 1h then reperfusion for 24h. Rats were divided in 4 groups: i) sham-operated group, ii) ischaemia/reperfusion, I/R group, iii) I/R protected by previous administration of Crateva leaves extract, CLE group and iv) I/R protected by previous administration of Crateva bark extract, CBE group. At the end of reperfusion, blood samples were analyzed for renal function biomarkers. Kidneys were examined histopathologically and their homogenates were used in determining the intracellular levels of oxidative stress, inflammatory, and apoptosis markers.", "Leaves and bark extracts attenuated the deleterious effects of I/R apparent in reducing LDH, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. The extracts reduced the oxidative stress by replenishing the glutathione levels and Nrf2 factor levels. Moreover, extracts decreased levels of pro-inflammatory TNF-\u03b1, NF-\u03ba\u03b2 and IL-6; which ultimately resulted in reducing the pro-apoptotic caspase-3. Bark and leave extracts have quite similar chemical profile where 42 compounds of various chemical classes were identified. Flavonoids are the major class of the bioactive phytochemicals CONCLUSION: C. nurvala extracts had effectively ameliorated the deleterious effects of renal I/R by mainly counteracting oxidative stress and presumably inflammation. Consequently, it can be used as a complementary treatment with other agents. In this aspect, leaves stand as a sustainable alternative to bark. The presented chemical profiling can be used in future standardization and quality control of the drug."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
