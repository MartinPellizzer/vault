Patients were asked to take 0.5 ml/kg/day of BO two times a day for three months along with UDCA. At the end of the study, serum levels of ALP, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), total bilirubin (TB), direct bilirubin (DB), and creatinine as well as prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR) and quality of life (QOL) based on PBC-40 questionnaire were assessed as outcomes.", "Our results showed that BO notably attenuated the serum levels of ALP, AST, ALT, GGT, TB, and DB, as well as PT and INR and significantly improved QOL.", "For first time, we showed that additional therapy with BO has a promising effect in the treatment of refractory PSC and PBC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Naghibi", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rakhshandeh", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jarahi", "ForeName": "Lida", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Surgical Oncology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Seyed Mousalreza", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yousefi", "ForeName": "Mahdi", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Avicenna J Phytomed", "NlmUniqueID": "101586220", "ISSNLinking": "2228-7930"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Abd AE-W, Ghareeb DA, Sarhan E, Abu- Serie MM, El Demellawy MA.
