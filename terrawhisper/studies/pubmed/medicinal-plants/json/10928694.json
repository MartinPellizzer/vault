Archeological data as well as literary and scientific texts suggest that the ancient Greek physicians knew how to use many remedies from herbs and plants, metals and minerals, and animals. These remedies were given per os, in liquid form (katapotia in Greek), in poultice form, or in the form of ointments and eye-drops (collyria). The main problem of ancient pharmacology was that chemistry had not yet become a science to help physicians individually distinguish each of the substances used as remedies and to estimate the exact effect they could cause to the human organism. However, especially during the classical period (Sth-4th century BC) and from the end of the Hellenic period and thereafter, remedies would be the combinations of substances presented clearly and in detail in prescriptions, giving medicine a more scientific profile of their workings."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical School of Crete, Laboratory of Toxicology, University of Crete, Herkalion-Crete-Greece."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ramoutsaki", "ForeName": "I A", "Initials": "IA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ramoutsakis", "ForeName": "Y A", "Initials": "YA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haniotakis", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsatsakis", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Vet Hum Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7704194", "ISSNLinking": "0145-6296"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greece, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacology, Clinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Toxicology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10928694"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
