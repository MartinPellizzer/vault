With these chemical constituents at hand, we have carried out the chemical evaluation studies of licorice roots available in Japan by means of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In the HPLC analysis using an ODS reversed-phase column, a combination of 1% aqueous acetic acid and acetonitrile was used as the mobile phase in a gradient solvent system, and the eluate was monitored with UV absorption at 254 nm (for saponins with a diene or a conjugated carbonyl moiety, liquiritin, and liquiritin apioside) or at 350 nm (for other flavonoid constituents). By our analytical method described here, quantitative analyses of saponin and flavonoid constituents were effected simultaneously. We have found an interesting piece of information concerning the origin of parent plants and their characteristic constituents such as saponins and flavonoids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kitagawa", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "W Z", "Initials": "WZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Taniyama", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Harada", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hori", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kobayashi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9868382", "10.1248/yakushi1947.118.11_519"]}}]}
