However, the adaptability and colonization ability of animal manure-derived bacteria determine the spread pathways of ARG in agroecosystems, which have rarely been studied. Here, we performed an invasion experiment by creating a synthetic communities (SynCom) with ten isolates from pig manure and followed its assembly during gnotobiotic cultivation of a soil-Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) system. We found that Firmicutes in the SynCom were efficiently filtered out in the rhizosphere, thereby limiting the entry of tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs) into the plant. However, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria in the SynCom were able to establish in all compartments of the soil-plant system thereby spreading TRGs from manure to soil and plant. The presence of native soil bacteria prevented the establishment of manure-borne bacteria and effectively reduced the spread of TRGs. Achromobacter mucicolens and Pantoea septica were the main vectors for the entry of tetA into plants. Furthermore, doxycycline stress promoted the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of the conjugative resistance plasmid RP4 within the SynCom in A. thaliana by upregulating the expression of HGT-related mRNAs. Therefore, this study provides evidence for the dissemination pathways of ARGs in agricultural systems through the invasion of manure-derived bacteria and HGT by conjugative resistance plasmids and demonstrates that the priority establishment of soil bacteria in the rhizosphere limited the spread of TRGs from pig manure to soil-plant systems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
