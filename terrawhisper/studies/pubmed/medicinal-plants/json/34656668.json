Some of these are recognized as central nervous system (CNS) disorders and diseases, whereas other ethnopsychiatric interpretations are explained in culture-specific terms. In traditional Mayan medicine, several herbs have been part of treatments and rituals focused on cultural and ethnomedical concepts.", "This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the medicinal plants used in Mesoamerica by traditional healers and Mayan groups to CNS disorders and associate the traditional use with demonstrated pharmacological evidence to establish a solid foundation for directing future research.", "A systematic search for primary sources of plant use reports for traditional CNS-related remedies of Mesoamerica were obtained from library catalogs, thesis and scientific databases (PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar; and Science Direct), and entered in a database with data analyzed in terms of the usage frequency, use by ethnic groups, plant endemism, and pharmacological investigation.", "A total of 155 plants used for ethnopsychiatric conditions in Mesoamerica by Mayan groups were found, encompassing 127 native species. Of these, only 49 native species have reported in vitro or in vivo pharmacological analyses. The most commonly reported ethnopsychiatric conditions are related to anxiety, depression, memory loss, epilepsy, and insomnia. The extent of the scientific evidence available to understand the pharmacological application for their use against CNS disorders varied between different plant species, with the most prominent evidence shown by Annona cherimola, Justicia pectoralis, J. spicigera, Mimosa pudica, Persea americana, Petiveria alliacea, Piper amalago, Psidium guajava, Tagetes erecta and T. lucida.", "Available pharmacological data suggest that different plant species used in traditional Mayan medicine may target the CNS, mainly related to GABA, serotonin, acetylcholine, or neuroprotective pathways. However, more research is required, given the limited data regarding mechanism of action at the preclinical in vivo level, identification of active compounds, scarce number of clinical studies, and the dearth of peer-reviewed studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
