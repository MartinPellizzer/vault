The results showed that in Tanchang county seven ecological zones 53 plots, wild C. pilosula distributed in there were 6 ecological zones 11 plots, accounting for 85.71% of the survey area, wild C. pilosula var. modesta was found only in an ecoregions plots, overlapping with C. pilosula region, accounting for 14.29% of the survey area. C. pilosula herbs reserves were calculated as about 461.85 t, economic capacity of 254.02 t, annual amount of acceptance 25.40 t. C. pilosula var. modesta herbs reserves were calculated as 67.75 t, economic capacity of 36.16 t, acceptance annual amount 3.62 t. The total ash C. pilosula was 3.25%, alcohol-soluble extract was 63.86%, while the C. pilosula var. modesta total ash was 3.69%, alcohol-soluble extract was 68.32%.
