In a double-blind trial, 14 patients with active duodenal ulcers were treated with Duogastrone capsules, one four times daily, half-an-hour before meals, while a comparable control group of 14 patients was treated similarly with a placebo containing magnesium trisilicate. Treatment continued for 12 weeks with clinical assessments fortnightly and a radiological assessment at the start and at the end of treatment. Only one of the 14 patients receiving Duogastrone did not respond. The remaining 13 showed marked clinical improvement with complete relief of pain and ceased to require supplementary antacids. Radiological evidence of healing or marked improvement was seen in eight of the 14 patients. None of the patients in the control group showed any marked improvement either of pain or tenderness and no changes were detectable by radiology. Patients in this group showed no reduction in their demand for supplementary antacids to relieve symptoms. No significant side effects were encountered. It is concluded that Duogastrone accelerates the healing of duodenal ulcer in ambulant patients and affords a much greater and more rapid relief of symptoms than does magnesium trisilicate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amure", "ForeName": "B O", "Initials": "BO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Gut", "NlmUniqueID": "2985108R", "ISSNLinking": "0017-5749"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antacids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Delayed-Action Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Placebos"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antacids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delayed-Action Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Duodenal Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Nausea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Placebos"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiography"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Practitioner. 1965 Nov;195(169):698-700", "ArticleIdList": ["5847578"]}, {"Citation": "Practitioner. 1967 Jul;199(189):109-11", "ArticleIdList": ["5343152"]}, {"Citation": "Gut. 1968 Dec;9(6):704-6", "ArticleIdList": ["4887691"]}, {"Citation": "Dent Health (London). 1967 Jul-Sep;6(3):47-50", "ArticleIdList": ["5237991"]}, {"Citation": "Practitioner. 1969 Mar;202(209):398-404", "ArticleIdList": ["5767369"]}, {"Citation": "Practitioner. 1967 Aug;199(190):220-2", "ArticleIdList": ["6058645"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1970", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1970", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1970", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1970", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4909818", "PMC1411344", "10.1136/gut.11.2.171"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
