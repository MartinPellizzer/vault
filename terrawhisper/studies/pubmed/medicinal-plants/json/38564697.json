CRISPR/Cas is deemed a burgeoning technology for nucleic acid detection. Herein, we developed a novel detection method for the first time, which combined thermostable Cas12b with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), to detect genetically modified (GM) soybeans in a customized one-pot vessel. In our method, LAMP-specific primers were used to amplify the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (CaMV35S) of the GM soybean samples. The corresponding amplicons activated the <i>trans</i>-cleavage activity of Cas12b, which resulted in the change of fluorescence intensity. The proposed bioassay was capable of detecting synthetic plasmid DNA samples down to 10 copies/\u03bcL, and as few as 0.05% transgenic contents could be detected in less than 40 min. This work presented an original detection method for GMCs, which performed rapid, on-site, and deployable detection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [],
