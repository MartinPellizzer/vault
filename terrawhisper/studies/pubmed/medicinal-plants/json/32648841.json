Recently, it has gained attention as a promising target for the discovery of natural products as anticancer agents.", "We examined the efficacy of two different sets of natural products (terpenoids and flavonoids) towards caspase-3 activity adopting in silico, cell-free and cell-based activity and real-time gene expression analysis.", "It was observed that terpenes activate caspase-3 activity in both the cell-free and cell-based systems, which was supported by the gene expression analysis, binding energy and activation constant. Flavonoids' action, however, was limited to the cell-based system and transcriptional regulation suggesting their indirect association, which enhanced the enzyme activity and up-regulated the expression of mRNA levels in the cells. Among the tested natural products, (+) carvone was observed to be the best activator of caspase-3 in K562 (34.4 \u03bcM), WRL-68 (22.3 \u03bcM), HeLa (18.7 \u03bcM), MCF-7 (39.4 \u03bcM) and MDA-MB-231 cell lines (45.1 \u03bcM).", "Overall, terpenoids have a persistent activation of caspase-3 in all the investigated systems, while flavonoids circuitously affect the enzyme activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Bioprospection Department of Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow-226015, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Masood", "ForeName": "Nusrat", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Bioprospection Department of Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow-226015, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Dubey", "ForeName": "Vijaya", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Bioprospection Department of Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow-226015, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Luqman", "ForeName": "Suaib", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "CASP3 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32648841", "10.2174/1568026620666200710101859", "CTMC-EPUB-108034"]}}]}
