However, due to the complexity of composition and extensive content distribution, the substance basis of its anti-gout effectiveness is still unclear. A strategy was proposed via integrating off-line two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) and targeted rapid screening technology based on ultrafiltration-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UF-LC/MS) and on-line high-performance liquid chromatography-2, 2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (HPLC-ABTS) to accomplish high coverage and high throughput screening of anti-gout components from P. cuspidatum. As a result, twenty components were screened from P. cuspidatum extract with both xanthine oxidase (XOD) inhibitory activity and free radical scavenging activity, then were preliminarily identified by high-resolution electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ESI-Q-TOF/MS). The screened results were verified by the in vitro assays. Meanwhile, molecular docking further elucidated that the screened bioactive ingredients had favourable binding capabilities with XOD. The performance of this study can achieve high efficiency and high coverage screening of the anti-gout components from P. cuspidatum, which provides methodology and strategy support for the rapid screening of bioactive ingredients from complex medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
