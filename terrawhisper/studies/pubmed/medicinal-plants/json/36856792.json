However, numerous issues including improved varieties selection, hazardous residue detection, and concoction management affect herb quality throughout the manufacturing process. Therefore, a practical, rapid, nondestructive detection technology is necessary. Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, with low energy, penetration, and fingerprint features, becomes preferable method for herb quality appraisal. There are three parts in our review. THz techniques, data processing, and modeling methods were introduced in Part I. Three primary applications (authenticity, composition and active ingredients, and origin detection) of THz in medicinal plants quality detection in industrial processing and marketing were detailed in Part II. A thorough investigation and outlook on the well-known applications and advancements of this field were presented in Part III. This review aims to bring new enlightenment to the in-depth THz application research in herbal medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Chaoyue", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, Fujian 350000, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Fangfang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiaohui", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}], "LastName": "Zhai", "ForeName": "Xuedong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Junmeng", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agricultural Internet of Things, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Agricultural Information Perception and Intelligent Service, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Keqiang", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agricultural Internet of Things, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Agricultural Information Perception and Intelligent Service, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yanru", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9004784", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8347"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36856792", "10.1080/10408347.2023.2183077"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
