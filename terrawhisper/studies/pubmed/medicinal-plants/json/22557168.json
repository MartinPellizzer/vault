Asthma has become the most common chronic disease in the world and epidemiological studies suggest that its prevalence, severity and mortality are rising at a time when mortality from other common treatable conditions is falling. The reasons for the above statistics are environmental factors such as increased exposure to allergens and atmospheric pollutants. Antiasthmatic treatment includes corticosteroids, which are very effective in the treatment of asthma. But corticosteroids are costly and if given systemically, have many severe adverse effects. Hence, the present research work involves the use of a herbal compound formulation Pentapala -04 prepared from five medicinal plants namely, Adhatoda vasica Need, Ocimum sanctum Linn, Coleus aromaticus Benth, Glycyrrhiza glabra Linn and Alpiania galangal Sw.The effect of \"Pentapala-04\" on ova albumin and aluminium hydroxide induced lung damage in albino wistar rats was investigated. The rats were divided into three groups of four animals each. Group I, II and III serves as control, toxic and post treatment group respectively. Our results showed that their was increased level of lipid peroxidation and secreased level of antioxidants in toxic group animals. But the levels of antioxidant enzymes were restored in post-treated groups of animals, which might be due to the ability of \"ability of \"Pentapala-04 to scavenge the reactive oxygen species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Reader in Biochemistry, Kongunadu Arts and Science College, Coimbatore - 641 029, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "D Srinivasa", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jayaraaj", "ForeName": "Indira A", "Initials": "IA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jayaraaj", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Anc Sci Life", "NlmUniqueID": "8307589", "ISSNLinking": "0257-7941"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22557168", "PMC3330933"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
