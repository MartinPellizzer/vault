(G. dahurica) is one of the legitimate sources of Qinjiao in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and grows on high-altitude plateaus. Plants develop unique biochemical accumulations to resist plateau conditions, especially the strong UV irradiation. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the polysaccharide of G. dahurica (GDP), its structure and its activity against UVB irradiation. Four GDPs were isolated and two of them were subjected to structural elucidation. The results suggested that GDP-1 has 53.5\u00a0% Ara and 30.8\u00a0% GalA as its main monosaccharides, with a molecular weight (Mw) of 23\u00a0kDa; the GDP-2 has 33.9\u00a0% Ara and 48.5\u00a0% GalA, with a Mw of 82\u00a0kDa. Methylation and NMR spectroscopy analysis revealed that GDP-1 contains \u21925)-\u03b1-Araf-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a05)-\u03b1-Araf-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a03,5)-\u03b1-Araf-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a03,4)-\u03b1-GalpA-(6-OMe)-(1\u2192 as the main chain, the branches of GalA (with esterification), and the terminal Ara; the GDP-2 contains \u21924)-\u03b1-GalpA-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a04)-\u03b1-GalpA-(6-OMe)-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a05)-\u03b1-Araf-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a03,5)-\u03b1-Araf-(1\u2192 as the main chain, the branches of \u21925)-\u03b1-Araf-(1-5)-\u03b1-Araf, and the terminal GalA. Both GDP-1 and GDP-2 exhibited concentration-dependent antioxidant activity against DPPH, ABTS and hydroxyl radicals. Moreover, GDPs significantly attenuated the decreases in viability and proliferation of HaCaT cells after UVB irradiation. They can scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and improve the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH). The potential mechanism explored by flow cytometry assays of cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution suggested that GDPs exert protective effects against UVB irradiation by reducing ROS and attenuating S phase cell arrest. In brief, the GDP-1 and GDP-2 are \u03b1-1,3- and \u03b1-1,4- arabinogalacturonan, respectively. The high content of Ara could be attributed to biochemical accumulation in resisting to the plateau environment and to prevent UVB irradiation-related damage in cells. These findings provide insight into authentic medicinal herbs and the development of GDPs in the modern pharmaceutical and cosmetics industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
