Several kinds of column chromatography were used for the isolation and purification of the main in vivo absorbed and distributed compounds from the extract of Halenia elliptica.", "Six main components detected in the extracts of the animal samples were isolated from the ethanolic extract of Halenia elliptica.", "After rats were treated with different extracts of Halenia elliplica, low polar components xanthone aglycon of Halenia elliptica were clearly observed in the extracts of liver, lipid, blood, hidney, heart and brain tissue of rats, while the polar components xanthone glycosides were detected in very small amounts in the animal samples. The xanthone glycosides can be decomposed into xanthone aglycons during the digestion, absorption and metabolism procedure. Therefore, the in vivo activity of the xanthone glycosides might be exhibited by their decomposed products. It is an accessibly valuable method to investigate chemical components of herbal medicines under the guidance by detecting in vivo absorption and distribution of chemical components of the herbal medicine extract."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Su-juan", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Rui-ming", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yong-chun", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shou-ren", "Initials": "SR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Si", "ForeName": "Yi-kang", "Initials": "YK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Jian-gong", "Initials": "JG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gentianaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthones"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15171655"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
