In this model, rats in restraint were exposed to 5 degrees C at 480 mmHg atmospheric pressure. Results were compared to an animal forced to swim in water at 23 degrees C. In both the models, colonic temperature (Tr) of the rats was continually monitored during exposure to adverse environment and during recovery at 32 degrees C and normal atmospheric pressure. The time and pattern for Tr fall to 23 degrees C and its recovery to 37 degrees C were used as measures of endurance. The cold-hypoxia-restraint model was found to provide more precise results compared with the cold-swimming model. Panax ginseng root and Ginkgo biloba leaf extracts were compared for their positive endurance-promoting properties using both models."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences, Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Ramachandran", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Divekar", "ForeName": "H M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grover", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Srivastava", "ForeName": "K K", "Initials": "KK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cold Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoxia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Restraint, Physical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swimming"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2214813", "10.1016/0378-8741(90)90038-u", "0378-8741(90)90038-U"]}}]}
