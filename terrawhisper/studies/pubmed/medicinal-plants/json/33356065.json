However, current evidence regarding the association of outdoor air pollution with some oxidative toxic stress (OTS) biomarkers in areas with different pollutant concentrations is equivocal.", "The aim of study was to investigate the adverse effects of outdoor air pollution on human health, by evaluating potential oxidative and anti-oxidative biomarkers and p53 protein levels in subjects exposed to different outdoor air pollution from two polluted and less polluted cities of Iran.", "In this cross-sectional study, a total of 203 healthy working men were selected from two cities. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and total oxidant status (TOS), were measured by the colorimetric method. The levels of p53 were measured by an ELISA method.", "The results showed a significant increase in the levels of p53 and MDA in the exposure group compared to the control group, while the activity of SOD and TAC was significantly decreased in the exposure group. No significant differences were found in activities of CAT and GGT, and levels of TOS between the two groups.", "The findings obtained confirmed the implication of air pollution in the development of OTS, and suggested useful biomarkers to evaluate the air pollution-induced harmful effects on human health in the polluted areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rezaei Vandchali", "ForeName": "Noushin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, Faculty of Health, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran."}], "LastName": "Koolivand", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ranjbar", "ForeName": "Akram", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zarei", "ForeName": "Parvin", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fathi", "ForeName": "Mojtaba", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Policy Department of Health Governance Head of Secretariat of Supreme Council for Health and Food Security Ministry of Health and Medical Education, Iran."}], "LastName": "Malekafzali", "ForeName": "Sheida", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mollamohammadi", "ForeName": "Nargess", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jalali-Mashayekhi", "ForeName": "Farideh", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Ann Agric Environ Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9500166", "ISSNLinking": "1232-1966"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "TP53 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Healthy Volunteers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33356065", "10.26444/aaem/126313", "126313"]}}]}
