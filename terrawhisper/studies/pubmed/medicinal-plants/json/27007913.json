In this study, we characterize the cyclotides of the medicinal plant Clitoria ternatea (butterfly pea) and investigate their biological activities. Using a combined proteomic and transcriptomic method, we identified 41 novel cyclotide sequences, which we named cliotides, making C. ternatea one of the richest cyclotide-producing plants to date. Selected members of the cationic cliotides display potent antibacterial activity specifically against Gram-negative bacteria with minimal inhibitory concentrations as low as 0.5 \u03bcm. Remarkably, they also possess prominent immunostimulating activity. At a concentration of 1 \u03bcm, cationic cliotides are capable of augmenting the secretion of various cytokines and chemokines in human monocytes at both resting and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated states. Chemokines such as macrophage inflammatory proteins 1\u03b1 and 1\u03b2, interferon \u03b3-induced protein 10, interleukin 8 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 were among the most upregulated with up to 129-fold increase in secretion level. These findings suggest cyclotides can serve as potential candidates for novel immunomodulating therapeutics.", "The protein sequences reported in this paper (cT13-cT21) are available in the UniProt Knowledgebase under the accession numbers C0HJS0, C0HJS1, C0HJS2, C0HJS3, C0HJS4, C0HJS5, C0HJS6, C0HJS7 and C0HJS8, respectively.
