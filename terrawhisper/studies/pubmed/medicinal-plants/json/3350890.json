Recently, the technique has been remarkably improved in both partition efficiency and separation time. In this paper the capability of this high-speed counter-current chromatography was demonstrated on separation of two sets of samples obtained from medicinal herbs: a synthetic mixture of 3'-hydroxygenkwanin, luteolin and apigenin was separated on a two-phase solvent system composed of chloroform-methanol-water (4:3:2, v/v/v) and a crude ethanol extract from Anisodus tangulicus (Maxin) Pasch on chloroform-0.07 M sodium phosphate (pH 6.4) (1:1, v/v). In the light of chromatograms obtained from these samples, advantages of high-speed counter-current chromatography over other chromatographic methods were discussed in terms of partition efficiency, peak resolution, separation time, sample loading capacity, etc."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Technical Development, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "T Y", "Initials": "TY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "D G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ito", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "0427043"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7C0697DR9I", "NameOfSubstance": "Atropine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DL48G20X8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Scopolamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Atropine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Scopolamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3350890", "10.1016/s0021-9673(01)82171-3"]}}]}
