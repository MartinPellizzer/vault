Among these species of Bacopa, B. monnieri is the only medicinal species, used for the treatment of cognitive impairment and improvement of cognitive abilities because of its bioactive constituents, bacoside A and B. However, because of the similar characteristics of these species, it is difficult to differentiate among related species, resulting in confusion during identification. For this reason, and to ensure therapeutic quality for consumers, authentication is important. In this study, the three abovementioned species of Bacopa were evaluated using barcoding coupled with high-resolution melting (Bar-HRM) analysis based on primers designed for the trnL-F sequences of the three species. The melting profiles of the trnL-F amplicons of B. caroliniana and B. floribunda were clearly different from the melting profile of the trnL-F amplicon from B. monnieri; thus, the species could be discriminated by Bar-HRM analysis. Bar-HRM was then used to authenticate commercial products in various forms. The melting curves of the six commercial samples indicated that all the tested products contained genuine B. monnieri species. This method provides an efficient and reliable authentication system for future commercial herbal products and offers a reference system for quality control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Chulalongkorn University Drug and Health Products Innovation Promotion Center (CU.D.HIP), Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, 10330, Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Research Unit of DNA Barcoding of Thai Medicinal Plants, Chulalongkorn University, 10330, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Tungphatthong", "ForeName": "Chayapol", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Chulalongkorn University Drug and Health Products Innovation Promotion Center (CU.D.HIP), Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, 10330, Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Research Unit of DNA Barcoding of Thai Medicinal Plants, Chulalongkorn University, 10330, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Somnuek", "ForeName": "Jutharat", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Rangsit University, 12000, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Phadungcharoen", "ForeName": "Thatree", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Naresuan University, 65000, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Ingkaninan", "ForeName": "Kornkanok", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, 10330, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Denduangboripant", "ForeName": "Jessada", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Chulalongkorn University Drug and Health Products Innovation Promotion Center (CU.D.HIP), Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, 10330, Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Research Unit of DNA Barcoding of Thai Medicinal Plants, Chulalongkorn University, 10330, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Sukrong", "ForeName": "Suchada", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Genome", "NlmUniqueID": "8704544", "ISSNLinking": "0831-2796"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bacopa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nucleic Acid Denaturation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30388379", "10.1139/gen-2018-0059"]}}]}
