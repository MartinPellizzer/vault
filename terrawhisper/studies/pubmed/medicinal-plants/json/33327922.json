The antihyperglycemic potential was measured in vitro in terms of increase in 2- deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake by L-6 rat skeletal muscle cells as well as in vivo in sucrose-loaded (SLM) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rat models. The blood glucose profile was measured at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 1440 min post administration of sucrose in rats. The in silico docking was performed on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) as antidiabetic target along with absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) studies.", "Nine semi-synthetic ester derivatives: acetyl (1), lauroyl (2), palmitoyl (3), pivaloyl (4), trans-crotonyl (5), benzoyl (6), m-anisoyl (7), 3,4,5-trimethoxy benzoyl (8) cinnamoyl (9) along with bromo derivative (10) of phytol were prepared. The derivatives 9, 8 and 2 caused 4.5, 3.2 and 2.7 times more in vitro uptake of 2-DG respectively than rosiglitazone (ROSI). The derivatives showed significant improvement in oral glucose tolerance both in SLM (29.6-21%) as well as STZ-induced diabetic (30.8-19.0%) rats. The in silico ADMET, docking studies showed non-toxicity and high binding affinity with PPAR\u03b3.", "The potent antihyperglycemic activity with favorable pharmacokinetics supports phytol derivatives as a suitable antidiabetic lead."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, P.O.- CIMAP, Lucknow- 226015,India."}], "LastName": "Upadhyay", "ForeName": "Harish C", "Initials": "HC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow-226031,India."}], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Akansha", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow-226031,India."}], "LastName": "Pandey", "ForeName": "Jyotsana", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic and Structural Biology Department; CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, P.O.- CIMAP, Lucknow- 226015,India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Pooja", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow-226031,India."}], "LastName": "Tamrakar", "ForeName": "Akhilesh K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow-226031,India."}], "LastName": "Srivastava", "ForeName": "Arvind K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic and Structural Biology Department; CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, P.O.- CIMAP, Lucknow- 226015,India."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Feroz", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, P.O.- CIMAP, Lucknow- 226015,India."}], "LastName": "Srivastava", "ForeName": "Santosh K", "Initials": "SK"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "#F.2-13/2006(SA-I)", "Agency": "UGC", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101240303", "ISSNLinking": "1573-4064"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "05V02F2KDG", "NameOfSubstance": "Rosiglitazone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "150-86-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rosiglitazone"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "30"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33327922", "10.2174/1573406417666201216124018", "MC-EPUB-112470"]}}]}
