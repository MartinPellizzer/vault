Additionally, supplementation of Se-garlic inhibited the post-initiation phase of mammary carcinogenesis when it was given continuously to the animals. In this report, experiments were carried out in which treatment with the Se-garlic was started after carcinogen dosing (DMBA or MNU) but was restricted to either the early or late stage of neoplastic progression. The results from these two models showed that a short-term exposure to the Se-garlic for 1 month immediately following carcinogen administration was just as effective in cancer prevention as the continuous exposure regimen (5 months), suggesting that the Se-garlic may irreversibly alter the process of clonal expansion and/or selection of transformed cells during their early stage of development. Plasma and mammary tissue selenium levels essentially returned to basal levels at 1 month after withdrawal of supplementation. These observations imply that the outcome of cancer protection by short-term Se-garlic intervention was not due to a slow turnover, and therefore a lingering presence, of selenium in the target organ or in the circulation. The above finding was in contrast to that of a second study in which Se-garlic was supplemented starting at 13 weeks after carcinogen treatment. With this protocol, the number of new tumors and the number of new tumor-bearing rats found during the intervention period (weeks 13 to 22) were not statistically different between the control and supplemented groups, suggesting that Se-garlic had a minimal effect on the later stages of mammary carcinogenesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgical Oncology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA."}], "LastName": "Ip", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lisk", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thompson", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA 27706", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Carcinogenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8008055", "ISSNLinking": "0143-3334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-97-6", "NameOfSubstance": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "684-93-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylnitrosourea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H6241UJ22B", "NameOfSubstance": "Selenium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food, Fortified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methylnitrosourea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Staging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Selenium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8824523", "10.1093/carcin/17.9.1979"]}}]}
