Flavonoids, a group of polyphenolic compounds have drawn significant attention due to their modulatory effects on inflammasomes associated with the initiation and progression of chronic disorders including metabolic, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In this article, the role of most commonly studied natural flavonoids with their disease-specific impact via inflammasomes as a potential molecular target has been described. Since the role of inflammation is evident in multiple diseases, flavonoids may serve as a promising tool in drug discovery for the intervention of chronic diseases by manipulating the status of inflammation via inflammasome targeting."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
