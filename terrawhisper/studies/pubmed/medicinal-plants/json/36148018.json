Due to the long history of the practice, medicinal plants have become an integral part of the Ethiopian culture. This study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial activities of <i>Vernonia auriculifera</i> Hiern and <i>Buddleja polystachya</i> Fresen leaf extracts and their synergistic effect against some selected human pathogenic bacteria.", "Ethanol, methanol, and n-hexane crude extracts of <i>Vernonia auriculifera, Buddleja polystachya,</i> and a mixture of the two-plant respective of each solvent were evaluated against tested pathogenic bacteria using the agar well diffusion method; the inhibition zones were recorded in millimeters. Gentamycin was used as a positive control, while dimethyl sulfoxide served as a negative control. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the plant extracts against test bacteria was evaluated using two-fold broth dilution methods and then Minimum bactericidal concentration was determined by sub-culturing the test dilutions from minimum inhibitory concentration tubes onto fresh Muller Hinton Agar plates incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h.", "Maximum antibacterial inhibition zone was observed on methanol extracts of synergism against <i>S. Typhimurium</i> (ATCC 1333) (31.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.73\u00a0mm) while, a minimum inhibition zone was observed on methanol extract of <i>Buddleja polystachya</i>, against <i>E. coli</i> (ATCC 35218) (5.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.57). Minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values of the crude extracts of <i>Vernonia auriculifera</i>, <i>Buddleja polystachya</i>, and their mixture lies between (3.125%-12.5%) and (6.25%-25%) respectively. The data were analyzed using the SPSS software package version 20 for windows.", "The present study revealed that ethanol and methanol extracts of <i>Vernonia auriculifera</i> and <i>Buddleja polystachya</i> possess significant inhibitory effects against tested pathogens and the antibacterial activity of both plants leaf extracts was greater than the activity of currently used antibiotics (Gentamycin) against some selected organisms."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biotechnology, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Haile", "ForeName": "Firnus", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "G/Medhin", "ForeName": "Markeshaw Tiruneh", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Kifle", "ForeName": "Zemene Demelash", "Initials": "ZD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Dejenie", "ForeName": "Tadesse Asmamaw", "Initials": "TA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biotechnology, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Berhane", "ForeName": "Nega", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Metabol Open", "NlmUniqueID": "101767753", "ISSNLinking": "2589-9368"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no competing interests."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Asressu K.H. 2013.
