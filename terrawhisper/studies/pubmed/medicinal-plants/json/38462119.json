They are widely accepted in food packaging due to their bioactive components, which exhibit remarkable antioxidant and antimicrobial properties against various pathogenic and food spoilage microorganisms. However, the functional efficacy of EOs is hindered by the high volatility of their bioactive compounds, leading to rapid release. Combining biopolymers with EOs forms a complex network within the polymeric matrix, reducing the volatility of EOs, controlling their release, and enhancing thermal and mechanical stability, favoring their application in food packaging or processing industries. This study presents a comprehensive overview of techniques used to encapsulate EOs, the natural polymers employed to load EOs, and the functional properties of EOs-loaded biopolymeric particles, along with their potential antioxidant and antimicrobial benefits. Additionally, a thorough discussion is provided on the widespread application of EOs-loaded biopolymers in the food industries. However, research on their utilization in confectionery processing, such as biscuits, chocolates, and others, remains limited. Further studies can be conducted to explore and expand the applications of EOs-loaded biopolymeric particles in food processing industries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
