This review looks at one aspect only, the problem of scurvy and what treatments were tried. In adding to our understanding of early colonial settlements and on how new medicinal plants were \"discovered,\" the Newfoundland story reveals a considerable interest in local plants as substitutes for scurvy grass. Suggestions are offered on how they may have been chosen and the rationales behind their use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "History of Medicine, Memorial University of Newfoundland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Crellin", "ForeName": "J K", "Initials": "JK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can Bull Med Hist", "NlmUniqueID": "101130981", "ISSNLinking": "0823-2105"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Archaeology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Canada"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Colonialism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 17th Century"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Rural Population"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Scurvy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14526801", "10.3138/cbmh.17.1.127"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
