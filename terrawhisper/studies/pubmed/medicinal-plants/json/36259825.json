On the 28 day of storage, the maximum Bifidobacterium longum and Lacticaseibacillus casei counts were determined in thyme containing yogurt and mint and basil containing yogurt, respectively. On the 1st day of storage, the most favoured yogurt was garlic containing sample while on the 14th day, the control sample was the most favoured one. Hardness values were not showed statistically difference for all sample (p>0.05). Especially the garlic and mint yogurt samples were more liked in terms of sensory properties. Consequently, aqueous extracts of some plants such as garlic, basil and thyme have successfully used in probiotic yogurt production and all yogurt samples containing plants have the enough probiotic counts to show therapeutic effect on human health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6479-7336"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aydin Adnan Menderes University, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Dairy Technology, 09070, Kocarli, Aydin, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Akan", "ForeName": "Ecem", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1532-4687"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ege University, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Dairy Technology, 35100, Bornova, \u0130zmir, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Yerlikaya", "ForeName": "Oktay", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7665-9245"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aegean Agricultural Research Institute, Technology Laboratory, 35660, Menemen, Izmir, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Bayram", "ForeName": "Ozge Yildiz", "Initials": "OY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5811-9851"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ege University, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Dairy Technology, 35100, Bornova, \u0130zmir, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kinik", "ForeName": "Ozer", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "An Acad Bras Cienc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503280", "ISSNLinking": "0001-3765"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Yogurt"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Probiotics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lacticaseibacillus casei"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rheology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ocimum basilicum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36259825", "10.1590/0001-3765202220211274", "S0001-37652022000501705"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
