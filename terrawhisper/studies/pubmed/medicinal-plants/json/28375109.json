Especially high serum lipid levels are directly connected to the progression of cardiovascular disorders, which are the leading cause of death all over the world. Date palm fruit (Phoenix dactylifera) is known for numerous health benefits however little information is available about in vivo clinical and preclinical benefits, hence antihyperlipidemic and hepatoprotective potential of native date variety Aseel has been assessed in hyperlipidemia induced albino rats. Forty adult male albino rats were divided into five groups with 8 animals in each group. One group was kept as normal control while remaining four groups were fed high fat high sugar diet for 8 weeks; from this one group was reserved as disease control while two groups as treated which received 300 and 600mg/kg of date fruit suspension. The fourth group served as positive control and received standard drug atorvastatin in the dose of 2.1mg/kg. After 14 days serum lipid profile, hepatic profile and fasting blood sugar were determined for all groups. Fasting blood sugar, cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and VLDL along with cholesterol- HDL and LDL-HDL ratio were significantly decreased at 300 mg/kg without any increase in liver enzymes as observed in positive control group. Animals received 600 mg/kg also revealed significant decline in fasting blood sugar, triglyceride, VLDL and alkaline phosphatase. Hence present results demonstrate ameliorative role of date fruit in hyperlipidemia and fatty liver however more studies are required to gain insight into the possible mechanism of action and confirmation of these effects on human subjects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Shadab", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Rafeeq Alam", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Jamil", "ForeName": "Subia", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Sucrose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "A0JWA85V8F", "NameOfSubstance": "Atorvastatin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Atorvastatin"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytoprotection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet, High-Fat"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Sucrose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperlipidemias"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "etiology", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phoeniceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28375109"]}}]}
