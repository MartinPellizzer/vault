PL catalyzes absorption and hydrolysis of triglycerides into di-glycerides into mono-glycerides and free fatty acids. PL inhibitors are well-known for the disruption of pancreatic lipase activity. The quest for novel pancreatic lipase inhibitors is crucially important owing to their therapeutic potential in the treatment of obesity and related chronic diseases. The present dataset provides information about the presence of endophytic fungi in the internal tissues of selected plants and the PL inhibitory potential of their metabolites using bioassay based screening. Absence of the yellow zone surrounding the standard Orlistat and test extract indicated PL inhibition due to the cumulative effect of metabolites present in the extract. The data suggests that TLC bio-autographic method is simple, rapid and reproducible and therefore it could be effectively used for high throughput screening of PL inhibitors from natural sources."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Biotechnology, R.
