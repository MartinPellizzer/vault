As retards growth of crop plants and increase several health ailments by contaminating food chain. Photosynthetic inhibition is known to be the prime target of As toxicity due to over-production of ROS. Hydroponically grown rice seedlings of twelve cultivars were exposed to 25, 50, and 75\u2009\u03bcM arsenate (AsV) that exerted negative impact on plastidial pigments content and resulted into inhibition of Hill activity. Internal CO<sub>2</sub> concentration lowered gradually due to interference of As with stomatal conductance and transpiration rate that subsequently led to drop in net photosynthesis. Twelve contrasting rice genotypes responded differentially to As(V) stress. Present study evaluated As tolerant and sensitive rice cultivars with respect to As(V) imposed alterations in pigments content, photosynthetic attributes along with sugar metabolism. Starch contents, the principle carbohydrate storage declined differentially among As(V) stressed test cultivars, being more pronounced in cvs. Swarnadhan, Tulaipanji, Pusa basmati, Badshabhog, Tulsibhog and IR-20 compared to cvs. Bhutmuri, Kumargore, Binni, Vijaya, TN-1 and IR-64. Therefore, the six former cultivars tried to adapt defensive mechanisms by accumulating higher levels of reducing and non-reducing sugars to carry out basal metabolism to withstand As(V) induced alterations in photosynthesis. This study could help to screen As tolerant and sensitive rice genotypes based on their photosynthetic efficiency in As polluted agricultural fields to reduce As contamination assisted ecotoxicological risk."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Physiology and Biochemistry Laboratory, Centre of Advanced Study, Department of Botany, University of Calcutta, 35 Ballygunge Circular Road, Kolkata, 700019, India."}], "LastName": "Majumder", "ForeName": "Barsha", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Physiology and Biochemistry Laboratory, Centre of Advanced Study, Department of Botany, University of Calcutta, 35 Ballygunge Circular Road, Kolkata, 700019, India."}], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "Susmita", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Regional-cum-Facilitation Centre (Eastern Region), National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB), Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, 700032, India."}], "LastName": "Biswas", "ForeName": "Soumyajit", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Regional-cum-Facilitation Centre (Eastern Region), National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB), Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, 700032, India."}], "LastName": "Mazumdar", "ForeName": "Asis", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Physiology and Biochemistry Laboratory, Centre of Advanced Study, Department of Botany, University of Calcutta, 35 Ballygunge Circular Road, Kolkata, 700019, India. dr.biswasak@yahoo.co.in."}], "LastName": "Biswas", "ForeName": "Asok K", "Initials": "AK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ecotoxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "9885956", "ISSNLinking": "0963-9292"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N7CIZ75ZPN", "NameOfSubstance": "arsenic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Arsenates"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32594380", "10.1007/s10646-020-02241-0", "10.1007/s10646-020-02241-0"]}}]}
