Discussions of mechanisms of action were noted.", "A comprehensive search of the scientific literature identified NHPs capable of affecting blood pressure. Case reports and clearly defined mechanisms of action provided strong evidence for the ability of ephedra and licorice to increase blood pressure. Coenzyme Q(10) was reported to decrease systolic and diastolic blood pressure, although the mechanism is unclear. The clinical significance of the blood pressure effects of other NHPs is unclear due to lack of conclusive in vivo data, as well as substantial variability in the chemical content of preparations of NHPs.", "Among published information, there is little definitive evidence with regard to the impact of NHPs on blood pressure. Additionally, effects may vary in a given patient with the formulation and standardization of a particular product. Until research better characterizes the effect of NHPs on blood pressure, patients should be encouraged to talk with their healthcare provider before starting or stopping any herbal product."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Richard", "ForeName": "Cynthia L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jurgens", "ForeName": "Tannis M", "Initials": "TM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Pharmacother", "NlmUniqueID": "9203131", "ISSNLinking": "1060-0280"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}], "NumberOfReferences": "90"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15741425", "10.1345/aph.1D067", "aph.1D067"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
