It is widely used in traditional medicine as analgesic, diuretic, antispasmodic, and antihypertensive plants.", "This study aimed to assess the possible antihypertensive vasorelaxant capacity and effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) of the aqueous extract of Rumex vesicarius (R. vesicarius).", "In the present study, the aqueous extract of R. vesicarius (AERV) was prepared, its antihypertensive activity was examined in N(\u03c9)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester(L-NAME)-induced hypertensive rats, and its vasorelaxant ability along with its effect on stimulating or inhibiting ACE-2 were performed in isolated rat thoracic aorta.", "The results indicated that AERV decreased the systolic, diastolic, mean, and mean arterial blood pressure in hypertensive rats. The data revealed that AERV exerted its antihypertensive effect through vasodilatory properties via an endothelium-independent pathway. Interestingly, the study demonstrated that the vasorelaxation ability of AERV might be mediated through receptor-operated calcium channels (ROCC). However, AERV extract had no effect on either stimulating or inhibiting ACE-2.", "The present study demonstrates clearly the antihypertensive and vasorelaxant activities of R. vesicarius in hypertensive rats, supporting its beneficial action as an antihypertensive agent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Team of Ethnopharmacology and Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Sciences and Techniques Errachidia, Moulay Ismail University of Meknes, Errachidia, Morocco.
