Neuroprotection against excitotoxicity has been considered as an effective experimental approach for preventing and/or treating excitotoxicity-mediated diseases. In the present study, six new sesquiterpenoids (1-6) and 26 known compounds of this type (7-32) were isolated and characterized from the whole plants of Chloranthus anhuiensis. Chlorantolide A (1) is the first example of a 5,6- seco-germacrane-type sesquiterpenoid, while phacadinane E (2) is a rare 4,5- seco-cadinane-type sesquiterpenoid. The structures of the new compounds were determined by spectroscopic analysis and by calculations of electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. Their neuroprotective effects in mediating glutamate-induced PC12 cell apoptosis were evaluated. Compound 26 exhibited potent neuroprotective activity with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 3.3 \u00b1 0.9 \u03bcM. Using Hoechst 33258 staining, a caspase-3 activity assay, and Western blot analysis it was demonstrated that this compound reduces the apoptosis of PC12 cells through inhibition of caspase-3 activity, while activating the Akt signaling pathway."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7033-8574"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Medicinal Chemistry,
