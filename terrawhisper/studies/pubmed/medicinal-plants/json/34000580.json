In the current study, tentative identification was performed due to limited information available on its phytochemical composition. Phytochemicals from AD fruit pulp were obtained using successive organic solvent fractionation. The LC-MSMS analysis led to identification of 91 metabolites from methanol, butanol and ethyl acetate extracts. Moreover, 20 compounds were identified in the petroleum ether extract based on high resolution ion masses. In vitro antidiabetic and antioxidant properties of selected extracts were investigated using enzyme activity and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method, respectively. Biological screening of the antidiabetic effects of target extracts was performed against streptozotocin-induced diabetes in experimental animals, following daily oral treatment for 3 successive weeks. Serum glucose, insulin, adiponectin, superoxide dismutase (SOD), lipid peroxide, cholesterol and HDL levels were measured. Finally, histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations of pancreas were carried out. Results revealed that animal groups treated daily with butanol (BuOH) and petroleum ether extracts of AD (oil) exhibited a significant improvement in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as well as antioxidant effect. Both extracts revealed superior effects with respect to the total (TT) and ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extracts. Histopathological and immunohistochemical findings supported these results, showing marked protection of the pancreas. Thus, baobab oil and butanolic extract of the fruit pulp protected animals against STZ-induced diabetic changes, in addition to attenuation of lipid peroxidation, hypercholesterolemia and oxidation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
