The cytostatic properties of oleanolic acid (<b>1</b>) and its 14 synthesised dimers (<b>2a</b>-<b>2n</b>) were evaluated against 10 tumour types and expressed as IC<sub>50</sub> values. Molecular docking was performed with the CB-Dock2 server. Antioxidant properties were evaluated with the CUPRAC method. ADMETox properties were evaluated with the ADMETlab Manual (2.0) database. The results indicate that the obtained OADs can be effective cytostatic agents, for which the IC<sub>50</sub> not exceeded 10.00 for many tested cancer cell lines. All OADs were much more active against all cell lines than the mother compound (<b>1</b>). All dimers can inhibit the interaction between the 1MP8 protein and cellular proteins with the best results for compounds <b>2f</b> and <b>2g</b> with unsaturated bonds within the linker. An additional advantage of the tested OADs was a high level of antioxidant activity, with Trolox equivalent for OADs <b>2c</b>, <b>2d</b>, <b>2g</b>-<b>2j</b>, <b>2l</b>, and <b>2m</b> of approximately 0.04 mg/mL, and beneficial pharmacokinetics and ADMETox properties. The differences in the DPPH and CUPRAC assay results obtained for OADs may indicate that these compounds may be effective antioxidants against different radicals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4492-6329"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Collegium Pharmaceuticum 2 (CP.2), Rokietnicka Str. 3, 60-806 Poznan, Poland."}], "LastName": "G\u00fcnther", "ForeName": "Andrzej", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5116-9426"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Biomaterials, Faculty of Pharmacy, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Collegium Pharmaceuticum 1 (CP.1), Rokietnicka Str. 3, 60-806 Poznan, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Phytochemistry, Institute of Natural Fibres and Medicinal Plants, Wojska Polskiego 71b, 60-630 Poznan, Poland."}], "LastName": "Zalewski", "ForeName": "Przemys\u0142aw", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6618-9956"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Biomaterials, Faculty of Pharmacy, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Collegium Pharmaceuticum 1 (CP.1), Rokietnicka Str. 3, 60-806 Poznan, Poland."}], "LastName": "Sip", "ForeName": "Szymon", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2958-9106"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Collegium Pharmaceuticum 2 (CP.2), Rokietnicka Str. 3, 60-806 Poznan, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Innovative Pharmaceutical Technology (CITF), Rokietnicka Str. 3, 60-806 Poznan, Poland."}], "LastName": "Bednarczyk-Cwynar", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Poznan University of Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Molecules", "NlmUniqueID": "100964009", "ISSNLinking": "1420-3049"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SMK8R7TGJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dimerization"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39125028", "10.3390/molecules29153623", "molecules29153623"]}}]}
