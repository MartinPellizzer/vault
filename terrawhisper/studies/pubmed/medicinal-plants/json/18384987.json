Most frequently reported (>or=20 times) plants represented Apiaceae, Poaceae, Pedaliaceae, Linaceae, Arecaceae, Brassicaceae, Malvaceae, Zingiberaceae, Rosaceae, Cannabaceae, Fabaceae, Moraceae, Rubiaceae and Mimosaceae families. All the documented plant species were indigenous to the study area. Genital prolapse, retention of fetal membranes, silent estrous/delayed puberty, anestrous, dystokia associated with incomplete cervical dilatation and retention of lochial discharge were the frequently reported reproductive disorders. Some of the plants were reported to be used in more than one condition. Materials other than plants used for the treatment of these disorders included camel milk, butter and butter fat, minerals, eggs, organic matters, chemical substances and meat preparations. These materials were used either alone or as adjunctive therapy.", "Richness of EVPs in the study area and extensive variation in the doses, methods of preparation, indications, and claims regarding efficacy of plants for various disorders merit controlled studies for their validation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Reproduction, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad 38040, Pakistan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dilshad", "ForeName": "Syed Muhammad Rehan", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Najeeb-Ur-Rehman"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iqbal", "ForeName": "Zafar", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Muhammad", "ForeName": "Ghulam", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iqbal", "ForeName": "Arshad", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Nazir", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Ethnopharmacol. 2008 Aug 13;118(3):530", "Note": "Ahmed, Nazir [corrected to Ahmad, Nazir]"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Buffaloes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dairying"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Data Collection"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Infertility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Veterinary Medicine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18384987", "10.1016/j.jep.2008.02.011", "S0378-8741(08)00097-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
