However, cannabis cultivation is illegal in many countries, and legal producers do not sell cannabis seeds in these countries. In Brazil, cannabis is still illegal, and the only way to obtain access to cannabis plants for research or as medicine is through importation, which is costly and requires authorization from the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), or from material seized by the police from drug trafficking. <b>Methods:</b> Therefore, since cannabis seeds obtained from drug trafficking have never been tested regarding their viability and use in <i>in vitro</i> cultivation, the aim of this study was to analyze the <i>in vitro</i> establishment of cannabis from seeds derived from Brazilian drug trafficking seizures that were provided by the police to investigate seed disinfestation procedures and further multiplication of nodal segments, with the purpose of obtaining material for medicinal research in the country. Seeds were subjected to four disinfestation treatments. <b>Results:</b> The best disinfestation treatment consisted in submerging the seeds in a 2\u2009g\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> Captan<sup>\u00ae</sup> solution for 30\u2009min before following the standard procedure with 70% ethanol for 30\u2009sec and then 20\u2009min in 2.5% sodium hypochlorite. The <i>in vitro</i> establishment of cannabis from seeds originating from Brazilian drug trafficking seizures was successful. The germination rate ranged from 10% to 90% according to the sample material. Non-brick weed, which consisted of dry leaves, stalks, and flowers, was more suitable for seed extraction and germination. Clones originating from BW4b showed the best development results compared with others. <b>Conclusions:</b> This is the first report of <i>in vitro</i> cannabis use in Brazil and opens great prospects for future work on its cultivation and research for medicinal applications in the country without relying on seed importation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal University of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei, Campus Centro-Oeste Dona Lindu, Divin\u00f3polis, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Pedrosa", "ForeName": "Alessandra Moraes", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal University of Lavras, Lavras, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Caetano", "ForeName": "Tha\u00eds Teixeira Val\u00e9rio", "Initials": "TTV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal University of Lavras, Lavras, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Andrade", "ForeName": "Camila Moreno Lopes de", "Initials": "CML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal University of Lavras, Lavras, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Bernardes", "ForeName": "Mateus Moreira", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal University of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei, Campus Centro-Oeste Dona Lindu, Divin\u00f3polis, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Alves", "ForeName": "Bruna Cristina", "Initials": "BC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal University of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei, Campus Centro-Oeste Dona Lindu, Divin\u00f3polis, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Belo", "ForeName": "Vin\u00edcius", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal University of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei, Campus Centro-Oeste Dona Lindu, Divin\u00f3polis, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Duarte-Almeida", "ForeName": "Joaquim Maur\u00edcio", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1412-0874"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal University of Lavras, Lavras, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Stein", "ForeName": "Vanessa C", "Initials": "VC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cannabis Cannabinoid Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101684827", "ISSNLinking": "2378-8763"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cannabis"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Trafficking"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37729052", "10.1089/can.2022.0305"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
