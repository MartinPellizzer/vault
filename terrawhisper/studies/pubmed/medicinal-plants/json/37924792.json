Noscapine (NOS) has several anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and anti-fibrotic effects, but its low solubility and large size results in its lower efficacy in the clinic. In this regard, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) encapsulated NOS (SLN-NOS) were fabricated using the well-known response surface method based on the central composite design and modified high-shear homogenization and ultrasound method. As a result, Precirol\u00ae was selected as the best lipid base for the SLN formulation based on Hildebrand-Hansen solubility parameters, in which SLN-NOS 1 % had the best zeta potential (-35.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.59\u00a0mV), average particle size (245.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017\u00a0nm), polydispersity index (PDI, 0.226\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09), high entrapment efficiency (89.77 %), and ICH-based stability results. After 72\u00a0h, the SLN-NOS 1 % released 83.23 % and 58.49 % of the NOS at pH 5.8 and 7.4, respectively. Moreover, Franz diffusion cell's results indicated that the skin levels of NOS for SLN and cream formulations were 46.88 % and 13.5 % of the total amount, respectively. Our pharmacological assessments revealed that treatment with SLN-NOS 1 % significantly attenuated clinical parameters, namely ear thickness, length, and psoriasis area and severity index, compared to the IMQ group. Interestingly, SLN-NOS 1 % reduced the levels of interleukin (IL)-17, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and transforming growth factor-\u03b2, while elevating IL-10, compared to the IMQ group. Histology studies also showed that topical application of SLN-NOS 1 % significantly decreased parakeratosis, hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and inflammation compared to the IMQ group. Taken together, SLN-NOS 1 % showed a high potential to attenuate skin inflammation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..
