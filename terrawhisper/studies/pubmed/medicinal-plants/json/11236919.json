Of this population, 77% had engaged in a habit, and dependent upon habit between 54 and 92% of these still remained current users. The highest prevalence of current use for boys and girls respectively was for areca nut alone (36%, 43%), followed by mistee pan (35%, 29%), betel-quid (27%, 26%) and pan masala (14%, 16%). Of the current users, 44% engaged in one habit only, 24% two, 20% three and 13% all four. The highest period of risk for starting to use areca nut alone, betel-quid and mistee pan was between ages 5 and 12, whilst for pan masala it was after 10. Boys had a significantly higher risk of beginning use before 10 (P < .001) and a higher frequency of use for pan masala (P< .01), areca nut alone (P< .05) and betel-quid (P = .06) than girls. The frequency of using each habit was between 3 and 5 episodes per week, however boys use pan masala approximately 10 times per week.", "South Asian children may already be experienced users of areca nut.
