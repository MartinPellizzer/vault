Ajwain (Trachyspermum ammi L.), a plant of significant medicinal and culinary value, is increasingly subjected to environmental stressors that threaten its growth and productivity. This situation is particularly acute given the well-documented toxicity of chromium (Cr), which has been shown to adversely affect plant biomass and escalate risks to the productivity of such economically and therapeutically important species. The present study was conducted to investigate the individual effects of different levels of PVC-MPs (0, 2, and 4\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup>) and Cr (0, 150, and 300\u202fmg\u202fkg<sup>-1</sup>) on various aspects of plant growth. Specifically, we examined growth and biomass, photosynthetic pigments, gas exchange attributes, oxidative stress responses, antioxidant compound activity (both enzymatic and nonenzymatic), gene expression, sugar content, nutritional status, organic acid exudation, and Cr accumulation in different parts of Ajwain (Trachyspermum ammi L.) seedlings, which were also exposed to varying levels of titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) nanoparticles (NPs) (0, 25, and 50\u202f\u00b5g\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup>). Results from the present study showed that the increasing levels of Cr and PVC-MPs in soils significantly decreased plant growth and biomass, photosynthetic pigments, gas exchange attributes, sugars, and nutritional contents from the roots and shoots of the plants. Conversely, increasing levels of Cr and PVC-MPs in the soil increased oxidative stress indicators in term of malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, and electrolyte leakage, and also increased organic acid exudation pattern in the roots of T. ammi seedlings. Interestingly, the application of TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs counteracted the toxicity of Cr and PVC-MPs in T. ammi seedlings, leading to greater growth and biomass. This protective effect is facilitated by the NPs' ability to sequester reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing oxidative stress and lowering Cr concentrations in both the roots and shoots of the plants. Our research findings indicated that the application of TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs has been shown to enhance the resilience of T. ammi seedlings to Cr and PVC-MPs toxicity, leading to not only improved biomass but also a healthier physiological state of the plants. This was demonstrated by a more balanced exudation of organic acids, which is a critical response mechanism to metal stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
