The main aim of this study was to review ethnic minorities medicinal records for <i>Paris</i> in China, the Chinese patent medicines based on <i>Paris</i> materials and the authentication and quality evaluation of <i>Paris</i> based on two parts of analytical technologies and data analysis. This article reviews approximately 100 articles from 1980 to 2019 published on the research of genus <i>Paris</i> materials and their Chinese patent medicines. Additionally, local books were also searched. Five major kinds of chemical techniques have been applied to authentication and quality assessment of <i>Paris</i> and among them, chromatography was the most widely used one, and DNA barcoding technique was the most worth further study. Additionally, more than 70% of the research studies were analyzed by unsupervised pattern-recognition techniques combined with analytical technologies such as spectroscopy. Meanwhile, the data fusion strategy with higher classification ability combined multiple supervised pattern-recognition techniques have been gradually applied to authentication assessment. The optimal analytical technologies and methods applied to <i>Paris</i> qualities for authentication and quality evaluation are greatly important, which could promote the development and utilization for ethnomedicines of <i>Paris</i>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Pei", "ForeName": "Yifei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qingzhi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuanzhong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9004784", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8347"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Liliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31357868", "10.1080/10408347.2019.1642734"]}}]}
