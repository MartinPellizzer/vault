Accordingly, the present study was carried out to investigate ultrastructural changes induced by the aqueous extract of Solanum incanum (SI) fruit on human colorectal carcinoma cell line (HCT 116 cells). Examination of SI-treated HCT 116 cells with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated numerous ultrastructural changes in the form of loss of the surface microvilli, mitochondrial damage and dilatation of cristae, and formation of autophagic vacuoles and increasing numbers of lipid droplets. Also, majority of the treated cells showed nuclear shrinkage with chromatin condensation and nucleolar changes. Moreover, some cells showed focal areas of cytoplasmic degeneration associating with formation of myelin figures and fatty globules. In conclusion, TEM was able to verify cytotoxicity of SI aqueous extract against HCT 116 colon cancer cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pathology, College of Medicine , King Khalid University , Abha , Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Forensic Medicine and Clinical Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine , Mansoura, University , Mansoura , Egypt."}], "LastName": "Al-Emam", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pathology, College of Medicine , King Khalid University , Abha , Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Al-Shraim", "ForeName": "Mubarak", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pathology, College of Medicine , King Khalid University , Abha , Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Eid", "ForeName": "Refaat", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Biology, College of Science , King Khalid University , Abha , Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alfaifi", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Biology, College of Science , King Khalid University , Abha , Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Al-Shehri", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Biology, College of Science , King Khalid University , Abha , Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Botany, Faculty of Science , South Vally University , Qena , Egypt."}], "LastName": "Moustafa", "ForeName": "Mahmoud Fawzy", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pathology, College of Medicine , King Khalid University , Abha , Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Radad", "ForeName": "Khaled", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ultrastruct Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "8002867", "ISSNLinking": "0191-3123"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Colonic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HCT116 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solanum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29565703", "10.1080/01913123.2018.1447623"]}}]}
