In this context, medicinal plants have become relevant tools regarding their potential role in the prevention and treatment of OA, being safe and effective. The aim of this work was investigate the therapeutic efficacy of the ethyl acetate fraction of Bixa orellana leaves (BoEA) and ellagic acid (ElAc) for the therapeutic treatment of OA induced by monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) in rats. The plant material was extracted via maceration with 70 % hydroalcoholic solvent (BoHE). The ethyl acetate (BoEA) fraction was by solvents in increasing order of polarity. The ElAc was identified and isolated in BoEA using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD) and analytical curve. The OA was induced using MIA in the right knee at the knee joint. Doses of BoEA and ElAc were administered daily (every 24\u00a0h, orally) at concentrations of 50, 100 and 50\u00a0mg/kg, respectively, for 28 days after induced OA. We evaluated the animals through clinical and radiological examinations every 7 days and, on the 29th day, the animals were euthanized, the joints being removed for histopathological analysis and the serum for cytokine analysis. BoEA and ElAc compounds reduced inflammation and nociception in OA and were as effective as indomethacin in clinical parameters of joint discomfort and allodynia in rats, in addition to showing improvements in radiological and histopathological images, acting on the progress of cartilage deterioration, proving properties related to anti-inflammatory and analgesic processes, being important allies for new therapeutic interventions for the treatment of OA."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
