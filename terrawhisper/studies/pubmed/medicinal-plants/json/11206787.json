A new method named iterative optimization procedure (IOP) specially used to resolve embedded peaks is also developed. With the help of IOP and other chemometric techniques, such as heuristic evolving latent projections, evolving factor analysis, sub-window factor analysis and orthogonal projection resolution, and etc., the detection of the purity of chromatographic peaks can be first addressed, and then the overlapping peaks are resolved into the pure chromatogram and mass spectrum of each component. The similarity searches in the MS database are finally conducted to qualitatively determine the chemical components. The results obtained showed that the accuracy of qualitative and quantitative analysis could be greatly enhanced by chemometric resolution methods. The chemometric resolution techniques upon the two-dimensional data can be quite promising tools for the analysis of the complex samples like traditional Chinese medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Institute of Chemometrics and Chemical Sensing Technology, Hunan University, Changsha, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Y Z", "Initials": "YZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Q S", "Initials": "QS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chau", "ForeName": "F T", "Initials": "FT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11206787", "10.1016/s0021-9673(00)00976-6", "S0021-9673(00)00976-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
