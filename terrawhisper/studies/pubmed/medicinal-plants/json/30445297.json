Their structures were elucidated based on extensive spectroscopic analyses such as HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR, UV, and IR, and their absolute configurations were determined by various methods including X-ray diffraction analysis, electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy (ECD), calculated ECD, and Mo<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>-induced ECD, as well as chemical methods. This is the first time to report the crystal structures of leucothane diterpene glycosides. Rhodomicranosides A-C represent the first examples of 15\u03b1-hydroxy-leucothane diterpenoids, leucothane diterpene diglucosides, and 9\u03b2-hydroxy-leucothane diterpenoids, respectively. Rhodomicranosides D and E are the second and third examples of 4,5-seco-ent-kaurane diterpenoids, and this is the first time to report 4,5-seco-ent-kaurane-type diterpenoids from the genus of Rhododendron. Rhodomicranosides F and G are the first examples of 5\u03b1-H-grayan-1(10),9(11)-diene-6-one diterpenoids. Some isolated diterpenoids were evaluated for their analgesic activity in an acetic acid-induced writhing test, and rhodomicranosides A-E and H, pierisformoside F, iso-grayanotoxin II, and grayanotoxins I, III, and IV showed significant analgesic effects with the percentage inhibitions over 50% at the dose of 1.0\u202fmg/kg. In particular, grayanotoxins I and III exhibited more potent analgesic activity than morphine at a dose of 0.2\u202fmg/kg, and they showed significant analgesic activity even at a lower dose of 0.04\u202fmg/kg with the inhibition rates of 71.5% and 69.3%, respectively. Their preliminary structure-activity relationships were discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
