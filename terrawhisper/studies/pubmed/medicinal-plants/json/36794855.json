To investigate the potential synergy or antagonism among chemicals in the extract, we obtained the compounds solavetivone (SO), tigogenin (TI) and friedelin (FR) from the herb. The anti-tumor effects of these three monomer compounds alone or in combination with the anti-inflammatory compound DRG were also tested in this study. SO, FR and TI used alone did not inhibit the proliferation of A549 and HepG2 cells, but the combination of the three achieved 40% inhibition. <i>In vitro</i> anti-inflammatory analysis showed that DRG had a stronger anti-inflammatory effect than TS at the same concentration, and the combination of DRG with SO, FR or TI inhibited the anti-tumor effect of DRG. This is the first study that documented the synergistic and antagonistic interactions between different compounds in a single herb."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1930-814X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Intitute of Medicinal Plants, College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Medicinal Plant Breeding and Cultivation, Wuhan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Provincial Engineering Research Center for Medicinal Plants, Wuhan, China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Dian", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science and technology, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiaohua", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Intitute of Medicinal Plants, College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Medicinal Plant Breeding and Cultivation, Wuhan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Provincial Engineering Research Center for Medicinal Plants, Wuhan, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xinxin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Intitute of Medicinal Plants, College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Medicinal Plant Breeding and Cultivation, Wuhan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Provincial Engineering Research Center for Medicinal Plants, Wuhan, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Biaobiao", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ethnobotany and Pharmacognosy Lab, Department of Botany, University of Chittagong, Chattogram, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Faruque", "ForeName": "Mohammad Omar", "Initials": "MO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Hubei Cancer Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Sheng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Hubei Cancer Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Intitute of Medicinal Plants, College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Medicinal Plant Breeding and Cultivation, Wuhan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Provincial Engineering Research Center for Medicinal Plants, Wuhan, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Xuebo", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hep G2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36794855", "10.1080/14786419.2023.2174538"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
