A (13)C NMR spectroscopic analysis of stereolensin has been done for the first time. These structurally related flavonoids were examined in vitro for their abilities to inhibit enzymes for the synthesis of thromboxane B(2) and leukotriene B(4) as well as hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity. Luteolin exhibited a high inhibitory activity against both thromboxane and leukotriene synthesis. In particular, a remarkable inhibitory effect was observed against leukotriene enzyme activity. The glycosides, cynaroside and cesioside, possessed a moderate inhibition activity against both enzyme synthesis pathways, while isoorientin and stereolensin exhibited selectively good activity against thromboxane synthesis. All the flavonoids showed excellent scavenging activity for the hydrogen peroxide at all the concentrations tested. The results demonstrated that the reactivities of luteolin and its related glycosides against arachidonic acid synthesis and hydrogen peroxide scavenging are dependent on their molecular structures. The presence of ortho-dihydroxy groups at the B ring and OH substitution pattern at C-5 position of the A ring could significantly contribute to the antiinflammatory and antioxidant activities of flavonoids."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Product Chemistry Laboratory, Research Institute of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Mongolian Academy of Sciences, Ulaanbaatar. odontuyag@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Odontuya", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hoult", "ForeName": "J R S", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Houghton", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KUX1ZNC9J2", "NameOfSubstance": "Luteolin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gentiana"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Luteolin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peritoneum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pyrola"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16220571", "10.1002/ptr.1723"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
