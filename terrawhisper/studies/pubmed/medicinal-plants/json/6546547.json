When poly(A)-containing RNA from similar cotyledons was translated in a cell-free protein-synthesizing system, an 80 000-Mr polypeptide was also detected. Immunoprecipitation of translation products with anti-legumin IgG showed that, in addition to the major legumin precursor polypeptides of Mr approximately 60 000, the 80 000-Mr polypeptide was specifically immunoprecipitated. A cDNA clone, pCD32, was found to select an RNA coding for an 80 000-Mr polypeptide in hybrid-selection experiments. Additional minor polypeptides of Mr 63 000 and 65 000 were present in translation products of RNA selected by pCD32; all three polypeptides were immunoprecipitated by anti-legumin IgG. Thermal elution of RNAs bound to pCD32 showed that the affinity of pCD32 to the RNA coding for the 80 000-Mr polypeptide was greater than to the RNAs coding for the 63 000-Mr and 65 000-Mr polypeptides. In similar hybrid-selection experiments, another cDNA clone, pCD40, selected RNAs coding predominantly for polypeptides of Mr 63 000 and 65 000. A minor polypeptide of Mr 80 000 was also detected among these products; again all three polypeptides were immunoprecipitated by anti-legumin IgG. Peptide mapping revealed close similarities between the 80000-Mr polypeptide and the 63 000-Mr/65 000-Mr polypeptides obtained by translation of RNAs selected by pCD32. There were similarities also between maps obtained from translation products of RNA selected by pCD32 and those obtained from anti-legumin IgG immunoprecipitates of total translation products of poly(A)-containing RNA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Domoney", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Casey", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0107600", "ISSNLinking": "0014-2956"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Precursors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AE28F7PNPL", "NameOfSubstance": "Methionine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Methionine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nucleic Acid Hybridization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Biosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Precursors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Legumins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6546547", "10.1111/j.1432-1033.1984.tb08010.x"]}}]}
