Currently, billions of dollars are spent on botanicals and related products, but minimal regulation exists regarding their purity, integrity, and efficacy. Cases of adulteration and contamination have led to severe illness and even death in some cases. Identifying the plant material in botanicals and phytomedicines using organoleptic means or through microscopic observation of plant parts is not trivial, and plants are often misidentified. Recently, DNA-based methods have been applied to these products because DNA is not changed by growth conditions unlike the chemical constituents of many active pharmaceutical agents. In recent years, DNA barcoding methods, which are used to identify species diversity in the Tree of Life, have been also applied to botanicals and plant-derived dietary supplements. In this review, we recount the history of DNA-based methods for identification of botanicals and discuss some of the difficulties in defining a specific bar code or codes to use. In addition, we describe how next generation sequencing technologies have enabled new techniques that can be applied to identifying these products with greater authority and resolution. Lastly, we present case histories where dietary supplements, decoctions, and other products have been shown to contain materials other than the main ingredient stipulated on the label. We conclude that there is a fundamental need for greater quality control in this industry, which if not self-imposed, that may result from legislation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o (UFMA), Department of Pharmacy, S\u00e3o Luis, Maranh\u00e3o, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Coutinho Moraes", "ForeName": "Denise F", "Initials": "DF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Science, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Still", "ForeName": "David W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Lum", "ForeName": "Michelle R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California-Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Hirsch", "ForeName": "Ann M", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Genetic Markers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Botany"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Markers"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis, DNA"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25856442", "10.1055/s-0035-1545843"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
