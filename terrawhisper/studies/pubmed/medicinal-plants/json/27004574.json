Since, it is a vector of deadly diseases, its control becomes essential. Medicinal plants may be an alternative to adulticidal agents since they contain rich source of bioactive compounds. This study was designed to determine the adulticidal activity of Spondias mombin leaf methanol crude extract, n-hexane, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate fractions against female adults of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and isolate active compound(s) responsible for the bioactivity.", "All leaf extract and fractions were evaluated for adulticidal activity against Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Adult mortality was observed after 24 h of exposure. The dichloromethane fraction was further purified being the most active fraction using silica gel column chromatography and the active compounds were identified with the aid of HPLC and LC-ESI-MS/MS. The LC50 and LC90 were determined by Probit analysis.", "Dichloromethane fraction was the most effective fraction with LC50 value of 2172.815 \u03bcg/ml. Compounds identified were mainly ellagic acid and 1-O-Galloyl-6-O-luteoyl-\u03b1-D-glucose.", "The S. mombin leaf extracts and fractions proved to be a strong candidate for a natural, safe and stable adulticide, alternative to synthetic adulticide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Agulu, Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ajaegbu", "ForeName": "Elijah Eze", "Initials": "EE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Danga", "ForeName": "Simon Pierre Yinyang", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chijoke", "ForeName": "Ikemefuna Uzochukwu", "Initials": "IU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Okoye", "ForeName": "Festus Basden Chiedu", "Initials": "FB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Vector Borne Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "101212761", "ISSNLinking": "0972-9062"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Aedes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anacardiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Survival Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27004574", "JVectorBorneDis_2016_53_1_17_179211"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
