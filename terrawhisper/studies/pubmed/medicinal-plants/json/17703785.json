The samples were extracted using ASE for 10 min under 100 degrees C and 9.65 MPa, and divided into water phase and chloroform phase and analyzed them with HPLC-DAD-ESI-TOF/MS method respectively. Based on this method, the HPLC fingerprints of Radix gentianae were established. Comparing the spectrogram and mass spectrum of the chromatogram peak with the reference value, three compounds in water phase were identified as gentiopicroside, asafetida acid and loganic acid. There is no report of the compounds in chloroform phase. The content of gentiopicroside and loganic acid in samples of different groups were determined, separately. The fingerprints were compared by the software of the similarity evaluation system for chromatographic fingerprint. The water phase fingerprint congruence coefficients of samples from six different areas were above 0.90, however, the chloroform phase fingerprint congruence coefficients were within 0.62 -0.99. This method can be used for determination of potent component in Radix gentianae and its quality control. Radix gentianae from different producing areas have the largest diversities, and the diversities embodied in the content of chloroform phase compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Qingdao Key Lab of Analytical Technology Development and Standardization of Chinese Medicines, First Institute Oceanography of State Oceanic Administration People's Republic of China, Qingdao 266061, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wen-Long", "Initials": "WL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jun-Hui", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Yue-Fen", "Initials": "YF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Feng-Qi", "Initials": "FQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Bai-Juan", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Huang-Hao", "Initials": "HH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Ru", "Initials": "XR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoid Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0WE09Z21RC", "NameOfSubstance": "gentiopicroside"}, {"RegistryNumber": "22255-40-9", "NameOfSubstance": "loganic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gentiana"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iridoid Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iridoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17703785"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
