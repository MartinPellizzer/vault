(Hindi name: Kshirakakoli) is a critically endangered Himalayan medicinal plant, well documented in Ayurveda for its therapeutic uses against various disorders such as jvara (fever), kasa (respiratory tract disease) etc. Its bulbs are also used as Szechuan-Pei-Mu for their antipyretic properties in the traditional Chinese medicine. However, despite its ethnomedicinal usage, the therapeutic use of F. cirrhosa bulbs for jvara (fever) related conditions such as malaria has remained unexplored. Hence in the context of increasing global concerns about drug-resistant malaria, it is important to investigate the antiplasmodial activity of F. cirrhosa bulbs for novel antimalarial agents.", "To investigate the antiplasmodial effects of the extracts/fractions of F. cirrhosa bulbs by the biochemometric approach and to rationalize its ethnopharmacological usage for jvara (fever) related conditions such as malaria.", "This study involves the UHPLC-MS-based plant material selection, preparation, quantification, and assessment of F. cirrhosa bulb extracts against CQ-sensitive Pf 3D7 & CQ-resistant Pf INDO strains. Further, UPLC-IM-Q-TOF-MS-based biochemometric approach has been applied for the identification of marker compounds responsible for the observed antiplasmodial effects. The identified marker compounds were also assessed for their in silico ADMET properties and binding efficacy with the drug transporter Pf CRT.", "Different F. cirrhosa bulb extracts/fractions showed promising antiplasmodial activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values 2.71-19.77\u00a0\u03bcg/mL for CQ-resistant Pf INDO strain and 1.76-21.52\u00a0\u03bcg/mL for CQ-sensitive Pf 3D7 strain. UPLC-IM-Q-TOF-MS/MS-based biochemometric analysis revealed four marker compounds i.e., peimine (m/z 432.3448), peimisine (m/z 428.3504), puqiedinone (m/z 414.3379), and puqiedine (m/z 416.3509) responsible for the observed antiplasmodial activity. The identified marker compounds showed excellent binding efficacy with Pf CRT and suitable drug-like properties in silico.", "The study demonstrated promising antiplasmodial activity of the chloroform and alkaloid enriched fractions of F. cirrhosa bulbs and further identified the four marker compounds responsible for the promising antiplasmodial activity. These marker compounds i.e., peimine, peimisine, puqiedinone and puqiedine were identified by the biochemometric analysis as the putative antiplasmodial constituents of the F. cirrhosa bulbs. Further, in silico studies indicated the good binding affinity of the marker compounds with Pf CRT along with suitable ADMET properties. Overall, the study elucidates the antiplasmodial activity of F. cirrhosa bulbs from the western Himalayan region and provides nascent scientific evidence for their ethnopharmacological usage in jvara (fever) related conditions such as malaria."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
