The results showed that 14 diseases such as root rot, powdery mildew, and drooping disease were common in the production of Chinese herbal medicines. Among the 99 pesticides reported, 67.68% were chemically synthesized, 23.23% were biological pesticides, and 9.09% were mineral pesticides. Among the reported pesticides, 92.93% of them were low toxic, with relative safety. However, 70% of the production drugs were not registered in Chinese herbal medicines, and the phenomenon of overdose was serious. The current pesticide residue monitoring standards does not match well with production drugs in China. Although the matching degree between Maximum Residue Limit of Pesticide in Food Safety National Standard(GB 2763-2021) and production drugs is more than 50%, there are few varieties of Chinese herbal medicines covered. The matching degree between Chinese Pharmacopoeia(2020 edition), Green Industry Standard of Medicinal Plants and Preparations(WM/T2-2004), and production drugs is only 1.28%. It is suggested to speed up the research and registration of Chinese herbal medicine production and further improve the pesticide residue limit standard combined with the actual production, so as to promote the high-quality development of Chinese herbal medicine industry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chang-Gui", "Initials": "CG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Wei-Ke", "Initials": "WK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology Kunming 650031, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Meteria Medica, Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Meteria Medica, Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Cheng-Gang", "Initials": "CG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Hong-Xia", "Initials": "HX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Control Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Control Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37381952", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20230214.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
