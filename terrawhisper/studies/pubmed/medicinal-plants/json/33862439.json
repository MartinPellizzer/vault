Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) is a potential soil pH adjuster to reduce metal toxicity. However, how GGBS affects the quality and yield of herbal plants under the stress of Cd and Cu is not clear. This study aims to investigate the quality and yield of a medicinal plant (Pseudostellaria heterophylla) responding to GGBS treatment in Cd and Cu contaminated soil. GGBS with three mass percentages (0%, 3%, 5%) was added into contaminated lateritic soils for planting. Each condition had 21 replicated seedlings. The concentrations of Cd and Cu in plant, amounts of active ingredients (polysaccarides and saponins) in medicinal organ, and tuber properties were measured after harvest. The results showed that under 3% and 5% GGBS treatments, Cd and Cu accumulations in all plant organs (leaf, stem, root and tuber) were reduced by 69.4-86.0% and 10.3-30.1%, respectively. They were below the permissible limits (World Health Organization, WHO). Even though the concentrations of active ingredients in P. heterophylla tuber decreased by up to 35.8%, they still met Hong Kong Chinese Materia Medica standard. Besides, the biomass of root tuber increased by 9.8% and 46%, due to 3% and 5% GGBS treatments, respectively. The recommended 5% GGBS treatment in practice can balance the reduction of active ingredients and the increase of plant yield when minimizing Cd and Cu accumulation in tuber."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
