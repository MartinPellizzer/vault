However, knowledge of volatile-mediated crosstalk between Streptomyces spp. and plants remains limited. In this study, we investigated the impact of volatiles from nine endophytic Streptomyces strains on the growth and development of plants. One versatile strain, Streptomyces setonii WY228, was found to significantly promote the growth of Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato seedlings, confer salt tolerance, and induce early flowering and increased fruit yield following volatile treatment. Analysis of plant growth-promoting traits revealed that S. setonii WY228 could produce indole-3-acetic acid, siderophores, ACC deaminase, fix nitrogen, and solubilize inorganic phosphate. These capabilities were further confirmed through genome sequencing and analysis. Volatilome analysis indicated that the volatile organic compounds emitted from ISP-2 medium predominantly comprised sesquiterpenes and 2-ethyl-5-methylpyrazine. Further investigations showed that 2-ethyl-5-methylpyrazine and sesquiterpenoid volatiles were the primary regulators promoting growth, as confirmed by experiments using the terpene synthesis inhibitor phosphomycin, pure compounds, and comparisons of volatile components. Transcriptome analysis, combined with mutant and inhibitor studies, demonstrated that WY228 volatiles promoted root growth by activating Arabidopsis auxin signaling and polar transport, and enhanced root hair development through ethylene signaling activation. Additionally, it was confirmed that volatiles can stimulate plant abscisic acid signaling and activate the MYB75 transcription factor, thereby promoting anthocyanin synthesis and enhancing plant salt stress tolerance. Our findings suggest that aerial signaling-mediated plant growth promotion and abiotic stress tolerance represent potentially overlooked mechanisms of Streptomyces-plant interactions. This study also provides an exciting strategy for the regulation of plant growth and the improvement of horticultural crop yields within sustainable agricultural practices."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier GmbH.
