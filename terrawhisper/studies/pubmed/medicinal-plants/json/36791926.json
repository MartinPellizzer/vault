(C. daurica) is a perennial herb known commonly as \"Xinba\" (Chinese) and \"Kanba-Arong\" (Mongolian). In Mongolia, it is used as a traditional medicine to treat eczema and other skin diseases due to its anti-swelling, anti-inflammatory, anti-hemorrhagic, and anti-itching properties. However, the potential mechanism of action for eczema treatment has not been reported.", "To investigate the effect of C. daurica on 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB)-induced eczema in rats and the associated action mechanism.", "Qualitative analysis of C. daurica was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Based on information obtained from compound identification and relevant literature, the possible targets of C. daurica against eczema were analyzed using network pharmacology and molecular docking methods. The DNCB-induced eczema rat models were treated with different dosages of C. daurica extract (10, 50, and 250\u00a0mg/mL per day), and the therapeutic effects subsequently evaluated based on the degree of skin inflammation, spleen index, and hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E staining). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and western blotting were used to analyze the relevant target effects. The C. daurica mechanism of action on eczema was verified by animal experiments. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out to determine the content of active ingredients in C. daurica. In addition, the physicochemical properties of the extract were evaluated.", "Our analysis of the 173 targets included in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network identified tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) as key targets involved in the treatment of eczema with C. daurica extract. Furthermore, the 173 targets were associated with the natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway. Our results showed that C. daurica significantly reduced IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 serum levels in eczema rat models (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001); thus, playing an important role in the anti-inflammatory response. Furthermore, according to the p-value, RT-qPCR and western blotting showed that the expression of Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1), Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Vav), and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) changed in the skin of the eczema model rats after treatment with the C. daurica extract.", "Our study confirms that C. daurica can inhibit SHP-1, Vav, and Grb2 expression; thereby, inhibiting the natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway. These results provide insight into the mechanism of C. daurica in treating eczema."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
