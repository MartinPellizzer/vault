The oils obtained in yields 0.4-4.0% (w/w) and the analysis of GC-MS/FID chromatogram was resulted in the identification of 43-47 compounds, representing 90.9\u2009-\u200996.7% of the total oils. \u03b1-Pinene was the main compound in all samples. The oils exhibited mild activity against <i>Bacillus pumilus</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> with or more than 15\u2009mm zones of growth inhibition and MIC values of 9-15\u2009mg/ml. Essential oil of immature and mature fruits showed potent antioxidant activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 35.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 and 39.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009\u00b5g/mL, respectively. So, this plant as an antibacterial and antioxidant agent can be useful in food and medicine industry.
