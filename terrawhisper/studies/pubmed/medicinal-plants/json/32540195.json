Numerous authors have suggested that single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) changes in the DNA sequence may be associated with the development of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The Gly972Arg polymorphism of the IRS-1 gene and the Gly1057Asp polymorphism of the IRS-2 gene are believed to be associated with the occurrence of insulin resistance and obesity according to many sources. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of these polymorphisms on the clinical parameters and to assess their correlations in obese Polish pregnant women. A total of 154 pregnant Caucasian women from the Wielkopolska region were analyzed: 78 diagnosed with overweight or obesity (study group) and 76 with normal body mass (controls). The analysis of the polymorphisms was performed using the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The IRS-2 Gly1057Asp polymorphism revealed no significant correlations with excessive weight gain during pregnancy. The analysis of the IRS-1 Gly972Arg polymorphism showed an association with obesity between the study and control groups (GG-80.77%, GR-17.95%, RR-1.28% vs GG-94.74%, GR-5.26%; p = 0.023). We also observed slightly increased BMI values \u200b\u200band higher values \u200b\u200bof the waist and hip circumference before pregnancy in the case of the IRS-1 Gly972Arg polymorphism. The analysis of the clinical and anthropometric parameters demonstrated no significant relationships between the genotypes of the polymorphic variants of the IRS-1 and IRS-2 genes but suggested an association between the IRS-1 Gly972Arg polymorphism and the risk for obesity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Society for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in Olsztyn.
