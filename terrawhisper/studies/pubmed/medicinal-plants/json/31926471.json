Results showed methane production was increased by 28.78% through adding mixed Cu salts. The mixed Cu group effectively reduced total ARGs abundance by 26.94%, suggesting mixed Cu salts did not promote the potential ARGs risk. The positive effects of mixed Cu salts on AD performance and ARGs removal might be ascribed to the low bioavailability. Microbial community analysis indicated the highest abundances of Clostridia_MBA03 and Methanobacterium in the mixed Cu group might cause the increased methane production. Spearman's rank correlation analysis elucidated the succession in microbial community induced by environmental factors was the main driver for shaping ARGs profiles. Thus, mixed Cu salts could be an alternative to replace the inorganic Cu salt in animal feed additives."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
