One of the molecular mechanisms behind the evolution and dissemination of multidrug-resistant species is the overexpression of efflux pumps. AcrB is a major component of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump belonging to the RND division and responsible for the extrusion of antibiotics from the bacterial cell leading to resistance. In this study, we applied the reverse chemogenomics technique to find inhibitors of AcrB to combat the issue of drug resistance. A total of 102 compounds from five different plants having medicinal properties were passed through Lipinski filter and ADMET screening was done to check their drug likeliness before docking against the AcrB protein and based on the -cDocker energy scores and toxicity analysis report, the compounds with best values were analyzed. A comparison was made between them and known inhibitors as well as antibiotics. Heat maps, frequency histograms, 2<b>\u2009</b>D diagrams were generated, and the molecules were simulated for 60<b>\u2009</b>ns using GROMACS. From the study, we have found Dihydrocapsaicin and Garcinexanthone-A to be a potential efflux pump inhibitors having all the characters of a promising drug candidate.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
