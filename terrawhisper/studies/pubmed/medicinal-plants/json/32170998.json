It has been associated with cardiometabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disorders, and increases the risk of developing fecundity pathologies including recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and infertility. C1q/tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1-related protein-6 (CTRP6) is a novel adipokine involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, host inflammation, and organogenesis. In the present study, we aimed to determine the association of serum CTRP6 levels with some components of metabolic syndrome in PCOS patients (infertile PCOS [inf-PCOS] and PCOS-RPL). This case-control study included 120 PCOS patients (60 inf-PCOS and 60 PCOS-RPL) and 60 healthy controls. Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and homocysteine were measured using commercial kits, while adiponectin and CTRP6 levels were assessed using ELISA technique. Inf-PCOS and PCOS-RPL individuals had higher levels of serum CTRP6 than controls (546.15\u2009\u00b1\u2009125.02\u2009ng/ml and 534.04\u2009\u00b1\u2009144.19\u2009ng/ml vs. 440.16\u2009\u00b1\u2009159.24\u2009ng/ml; both p <\u2009.001). Moreover, serum adiponectin levels were significantly reduced, while fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, free testosterone, and hs-CRP levels were significantly elevated in PCOS group, when compared with controls. Furthermore, serum CTRP6 positively associated with body mass index in all subjects. It showed an inverse correlation with adiponectin in PCOS group and subgroups. However, it had a direct association with hs-CRP in PCOS group and inf-PCOS subgroup, but not PCOS-RPL subgroup. These findings unravel a probable role of CTRP6 in PCOS pathogenesis, which poses a possibility to be a good diagnostic target. However, further investigation is needed."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Afzalipour School of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Afzalipour School of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghi", "ForeName": "Asie", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sleep Disorders Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fadaei", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Research Institute for Health Development, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrine Research Center, Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moradi", "ForeName": "Nariman", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7673-9731"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Nutrition, School of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fouani", "ForeName": "Fatima Z", "Initials": "FZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Roozbehkia", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shahid Akbar Abadi Clinical Research Development Unit (ShACRDU), Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zandieh", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Reproductive Biotechnology Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute, ACECR, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ansaripour", "ForeName": "Soheila", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Comparative Biosciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student's Scientific Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vatannejad", "ForeName": "Akram", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Doustimotlagh", "ForeName": "Amir H", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "IUBMB Life", "NlmUniqueID": "100888706", "ISSNLinking": "1521-6543"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "C1qTNF6 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Mass Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Insulin Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "De Leo V, Musacchio MC, Cappelli V, Massaro MG, Morgante G, Petraglia F.
