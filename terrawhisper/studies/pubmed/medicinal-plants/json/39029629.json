Proanthocyanidins (PAs), as one of the main types of flavonoids, are the key components of loquat fruit quality and medicinal properties. However, the identification of transcription factors (TFs) involved in PA accumulation in loquat remains limited. R2R3-MYB TFs play key regulatory role in PA accumulation in plants. In this study, 190 R2R3-MYB TFs were identified in loquat genome. Combined with transcriptome data, R2R3-MYB TF EjMYB5 involved in PA accumulation in loquat was isolated. EjMYB5 was transcriptional activator localized to nucleus. Expression of EjMYB5 was closely related to PA accumulation in loquat fruits. Heterogenous overexpression of EjMYB5 in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) inhibited anthocyanin accumulation and promoted PA accumulation. Additionally, transient overexpression of EjMYB5 in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves promoted PA accumulation by upregulating flavonoid biosynthesis genes (NtDFR, NtANS, and NtLAR). Transcriptome analysis of EjMYB5-overexpressing tomato fruits suggested that EjMYB5 was involved in several biological pathways, including lipid metabolism, MAPK signaling, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and flavonoid biosynthesis. Collectively, our findings provided basic data for further analysis the function of R2R3-MYB TFs in loquat, and revealed that EjMYB5 functioned as PA accumulation in loquat."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
