In order to clarify the origin and variety evolution of different processed products of Dihuang in Chinese classical prescriptions, ancient herbal books were examined in this paper. Both ancient and modern Dihuang is derived from <i>Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch</i>. in <i>Scrophulariaceae,</i> and <i>R</i>. <i>chingii Li</i> has been used as local medication. Dihuang has been cultivated since the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and the cultivation technique was mature in the Tang and Song Dynasties. Huaiqing Prefecture of Henan Province has been regarded as its genuine producing area. \"Dried Dihuang\" in <i>Shennong Bencao Jing</i>(, <i>Shennong</i>'<i>s Classic of Materia Medica</i>) included raw Dihuang and processed Dihuang. <i>Mingyi Bielu</i>(, <i>Alternative Records of Famous Physicians</i>) has described \"raw Dihuang\" and \"Dried Dihuang\" separately, in which \"raw Dihuang\" should be fresh Dihuang in modern times. <i>Bencao Tujing</i>(, <i>Illustration of Materia Medica</i>) in the Song Dynasty has recorded \"raw Dihuang\" and \"processed Dihuang\" correspondingly. The \"raw Dihuang\" was similar to today's raw Dihuang. \"Processed Dihuang\" has been recorded in the prescriptions of the Qin and Han Dynasties, which was independently described in the Song Dynasty. The processing methods of processed Dihuang were various in the Ming Dynasty. Processed Dihuang mainly refers to the dried products after stewing with wine or steaming until dark, and the processing methods tend to be simplified in modern times. \"Raw and dried Dihuang\" and \"dried and processed Dihuang\" have been independently recorded first in ancient herbal books of the Ming Dynasty, which is the raw Dihuang and processed Dihuang, respectively. This paper has sorted out the varieties of Dihuang, providing a basis of herbology for the origin and processing of traditional Chinese medicinal materials of Dihuang."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bozhou Institute of Chinese Medicine, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Bozhou 236800, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhan", "ForeName": "Z L", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China; National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China; Research Unit of DAO-DI-Herbs, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences(2019RU057), Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2017YFC1701601", "Agency": "The National key research and development plan", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2060302", "Agency": "Major Increase and Reduction Expenditure Projects at the Central Level", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2019-12M-5-065", "Agency": "CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Yi Shi Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8303081", "ISSNLinking": "0255-7053"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 15th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 16th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Medieval"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prescriptions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "19"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33287494", "10.3760/cma.j.cn112155-20191028-00093"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
