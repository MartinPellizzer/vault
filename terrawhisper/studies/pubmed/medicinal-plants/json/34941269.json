Herein, a series of novel and easily accessed cinchona-alkaloid-based NNP ligands have been developed in two steps. By combining [Ir(COD)Cl]<sub>2</sub>, 39 ketones including aromatic, heteroaryl, and alkyl ketones have been hydrogenated, all affording valuable chiral alcohols with 96.0-99.9% ee. A plausible reaction mechanism was discussed by NMR, HRMS, and DFT, and an activating model involving trihydride was verified."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2608-8587"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Linlin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Chong", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yuanyong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4890-109X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chun", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Org Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "100890393", "ISSNLinking": "1523-7052"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34941269", "10.1021/acs.orglett.1c04101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
