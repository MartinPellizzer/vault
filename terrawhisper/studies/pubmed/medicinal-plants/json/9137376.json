The cellular phenotype of pathological infiltrations can be identified with monoclonal antibodies. DRUG-INDUCED INTERSTITIAL NEPHROPATHIES: Extrarenal manifestations (skin eruptions, fever, joint pain) often suggests the diagnosis but may be absent, in which case renal histology is required. CAUSAL DRUGS: Among the different causal agents, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs cause abnormal leakage from glomerular capillaries favoring the development of a nephrotic syndrome associated with renal failure and major cell infiltration into the interstitial tissue. CHRONIC DISEASE: Chronic interstitial nephropathy is nearly asymptomatic and may only be discovered at an advanced stage. Briefly, there are three categories which result from long-term administration of 5-aminosalicylate, use of Chinese herbal medicines to lose weight, and chronic intoxication with ochratoxin (a mycotoxin). COMPLEX PHYSIOPATHOLOGY: Immunological mechanisms are involved although it is not always easy to distinguish between manifestations of humoral and cellular reactions. Both could be implicated as indicated in recent experimental animal models which throw more light on the pathological process in humans. RENAL PROGNOSIS: Different strategies can be used to halt or limit the development of fibrosis and thus improve prognosis of toxic interstitial nephropathies: counteract cellular immunity reactions, inhibit fibroblast proliferation and activation, reduce synthesis and stimulate degradation of the extracellular matrix, and inhibit collagen formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Service de N\u00e9phrologie, CHU de Rouen."}], "LastName": "Fillastre", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Legallicier", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Godin", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Le Roy", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"], "VernacularTitle": "N\u00e9phropathies interstitielles d'origine m\u00e9dicamenteuse ou toxique.
