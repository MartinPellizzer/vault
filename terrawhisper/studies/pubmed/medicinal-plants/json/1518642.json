The clinical significance of this lesion in an otherwise healthy, high-risk symptom-free person is that it can be an early manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Because of its benign nature and the lack of clinical evidence that treatment of the lesion improves the prognosis of human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, systemic therapy with antiviral drugs does not seem warranted at this time. Topical retinoids (Retin-A sol) and systemic antivirals such as acyclovir have been previously tried; however, lesions tend to recur a few days after treatment is discontinued. Nine patients with oral hairy leukoplakia seen at the Oral Medicine Clinic, University of California San Francisco were offered treatment with podophyllum resin 25% sol. All patients had a complete remission of their condition within 1 week (5 patients) or after the second application a week later (4 patients). Side effects were transient and reversible. These remissions of oral hairy leukoplakia lasted from 2 to 28 weeks, which suggests that podophyllum may be a relatively safe and cost-effective treatment of this otherwise symptom-free lesion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Stomatology, School of Dentistry, University of California, San Francisco."}], "LastName": "Lozada-Nur", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Costa", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376406", "ISSNLinking": "0030-4220"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9000-55-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Podophyllin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "HIV Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Leukoplakia, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Podophyllin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Podophyllum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1518642", "10.1016/0030-4220(92)90097-a"]}}]}
