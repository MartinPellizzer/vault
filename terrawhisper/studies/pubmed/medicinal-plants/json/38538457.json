The urgency for mass production and optimized utilization of plant secondary metabolites has intensified, particularly in response to the emergence of diseases following the COVID-19 pandemic. Groundbreaking advancements in genomics and biotechnologies have ushered in a new era of research, transforming our understanding of the biosynthesis, regulation, and manipulation of bioactive molecules in medicinal plants. This special issue serves as a convergence point for a diverse array of original research articles and reviews, collectively aiming to unveil the intricate regulatory mechanisms that govern the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants. The issue delves into the exploration of the impact of both abiotic and biotic factors on the regulation of plant secondary metabolites. Furthermore, it extends its focus to innovative approaches, such as molecular breeding and synthetic biology, which provide valuable insights into modifying or enhancing the production of secondary metabolites. The special issue leverages cutting-edge techniques, including genomics, metabolomics, and microbiome characterization, to facilitate understanding the multifaceted aspects of specialized metabolism in medicinal plants. As we navigate through this scientific journey, the contributions within this special issue collectively enhance our knowledge and offer potential avenues for optimizing the production of natural products in medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS.
