This experience is easily obtained by composing your own series of locally important flavorings and by using this series to assess the irritant potency. In our patients, not many strong irritation reactions were elicited. Only 100 per cent garlic powder was obviously too irritant, whereas 25 per cent in petrolatum might be too low to detect allergy. Positive reactions to unknown spices need to be checked in controls; this is important when patch tests are done with spices brought in by the patient. A positive patch-test reaction to a fragrance or perfume indicator in housewives, cooks, and confectioners with hand eczema is an indication to perform patch tests with spices because of the relation between spices and fragrances."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational Dermatology, Free University Academic Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}], "LastName": "Bruynzeel", "ForeName": "D P", "Initials": "DP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Prevoo", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Dermatol Clin", "NlmUniqueID": "8300886", "ISSNLinking": "0733-8635"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Perfume"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Condiments"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Hand Dermatoses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Patch Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Perfume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2302865"]}}]}
