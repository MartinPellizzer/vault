It has a long medicinal history and is widely used in the treatment of various diseases, such as hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, bruises, lumps and carbuncles.", "The purpose of this review is to systematically evaluate the traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and quality control of main medicinal plants of Aralia, discusses the application of ethnic medicine, modern scientific research and the relationship between them, and put forward some suggestions to promote the further development and utilization of Aralia.", "The relevant information on Aralia was collected through electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Springer, CNKI and Wanfang), Chinese herbal classics, Ph.D. and M.Sc. dissertations, Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Plant names were verified by \"The Plant List\" (http://www.theplantlist.org). The literature cited in this review can be traced back to 1878 to 2021.", "More than 290 chemical constituents have been isolated from the genus Aralia, including triterpenoid saponins, terpenoids, organic acids, flavonoids, polyacetylenes, phenylpropanoids and other constituents. Pharmacological studies have shown that the extracts and compounds of Aralia have a wide range of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammation, analgesic, anti-tumor, liver protection, protection of cardiovascular and nervous system, regulating substance metabolism, antibacterial, antiviral and antioxidation.", "The genus Aralia is not only an excellent traditional herbal medicine, but also a source of bioactive molecules with good application prospects. However, the structure-activity relationship, in vivo activity and action mechanism of its bioactive components need to be further studied. In addition, more toxicological and quality control studies are essential to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Aralia as medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
