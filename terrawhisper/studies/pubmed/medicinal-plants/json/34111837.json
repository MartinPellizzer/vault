Different harvest years determine the dry matter accumulation of its medicinal parts and the dynamic accumulation of active ingredients, as well as its economic value and medicinal value. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a systematic evaluation method for the identification and evaluation of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis with different growth years. Deep learning has a powerful ability in recognition. This study extends it to the identification analysis of medicinal plants from the perspective of spectrum. For the first time, two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) based on the attenuated total reflection Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) combined with residual neural network (Resnet) was used to identify growth years. 525 samples were collected, 4725 2DCOS images were drawn, and the dry matter accumulation in rhizomes of different growth years and different sampling sites were briefly analyzed. The results show that the eight-year-old P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis in Dali has higher economic value and medicinal value. The synchronous 2DCOS models based on ATR-FTIR can realize the identification of growth years with accuracy of 100%. Synchronous 2DCOS are more suitable for the identification of medicinal plants with complex systems. 2DCOS images with different colors and second derivative processing cannot optimize the modeling results. In summary, the method we established is innovative and feasible. It not only solved the identification of growth years, expanded the application field of deep learning, but could also be extended to further research on other medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
