It was found that PDAO is inhibited in a time-dependent manner at pH = 7.0 by the hydrazides of acetic, benzoic, nicotinic, isonicotinic, picolinic and 3,4-dihydro-4-oxophtalazine-1-carboxylic acids, by 1-(carboxymethyl)trimethylammonium chloride hydrazide (Girard's reagent T), 1-(carboxymethyl)pyridinium chloride hydrazide (Girard's reagent P) and oxalic acid dihydrazide. The inhibition was partially reversible. Rate constants for enzyme inactivation were in the range 0.29-1.95 min-1. The hydrazides give apparent noncompetitive inhibition at pH = 7.0, but for isonicotinic hydrazide, this changes to competitive inhibition at pH = 8.0. Apparent inhibition constants (K1APP) for the hydrazides with PDAO are in the range 0.005-1.5 mmol l-1."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical and Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Palack\u00fd University, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia."}], "LastName": "Pec", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Haviger", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kopecn\u00e1", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fr\u00e9bort", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "J Enzyme Inhib", "NlmUniqueID": "8709734", "ISSNLinking": "1026-5457"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.3.21", "NameOfSubstance": "Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrazines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1284961", "10.3109/14756369209020174"]}}]}
