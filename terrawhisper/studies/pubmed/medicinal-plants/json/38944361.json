Schistosomiasis has been a widespread issue in China for at least 2000 years. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a rich history of treating this disease, and the significant theoretical and practical knowledge attained therein may be useful in modern practice.", "To comprehensively review TCM for the treatment of schistosomiasis, summarize the molecular basis, mechanism of action, active ingredients and formulas of TCM, and clarify the value of TCM for expanding drug options for the clinical treatment of schistosomiasis.", "In PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and CNKI databases, \"Schistosomiasis\", \"Schistosoma mansoni\", \"Schistosoma japonicum\", \"Liver fibrosis\" and \"Granuloma\" were used as the key words. Information related to in vivo animal studies and clinical studies of TCM for the treatment of schistosomiasis in the past 25 years was retrieved, and the inclusion criteria focused on medicinal plants that had a history of use in China.", "In this study, we collected and organized a large amount of literature on the treatment of schistosomiasis by TCM. TCM exerts therapeutic effects through antischistosomal and immunomodulatory effects, suppresses HSC activation and proliferation, reduces ECM deposition, and inhibits oxidative stress and other activities. The treatment of schistosomiasis by TCM has a unique advantage, especially for the treatment of schistosomal liver fibrosis, and the treatment of schistosomiasis with TCM in combination with praziquantel is superior to monotherapy.", "Schistosomiasis remains a global public health problem, and TCM has made significant progress in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis and is a potential source of drugs for the treatment of schistosomiasis. However, research on drug screening and the mechanism of action of TCM for the treatment of schistosomiasis is lacking, and further studies and research are needed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
