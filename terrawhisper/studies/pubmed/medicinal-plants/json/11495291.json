Repeated administration of the extract (once a day for seven consecutive days), at an oral dose equivalent to 250 mg kg(-1), significantly improved glucose tolerance in rats. The peak blood glucose level was obtained at 30 min of glucose load (2 g kg(-1)), thereafter a decreasing trend was recorded up to 120 min. The data exhibit that repeated ingestion of the reference drug tolbutamide, a sulphonylurea and the extract brings about 2-3 fold decrease in blood glucose concentration as compared to single oral treatment. The results clearly indicate that tolbutamide improves the glucose tolerance by 91% and extract does so only by 47%. At 250 mg kg(-1), the efficacy of the extract was 51.5% of tolbutamide (100mg kg(-1)). In streptozotocin diabetic rats, no significant effect was observed with the extract, while glibenclamide significantly lowered the glucose level up to 7 hr. These data suggest that hypoglycemic activity of H. rosa sinensis leaf extract is comparable to tolbutamide and not to glibenclamide treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Dayalbagh Educational Institute, Agra, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sachdewa", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nigam", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khemani", "ForeName": "L D", "Initials": "LD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperglycemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Malvaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11495291"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
