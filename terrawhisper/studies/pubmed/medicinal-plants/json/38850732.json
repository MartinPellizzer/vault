LncRNAs that have been functionally characterized have pivotal functions in several plant processes, including the regulation of flowering, and development of lateral roots. It also plays a crucial role in the plant's response to abiotic stressors and exhibits vital activities in environmental adaptation. The progress in NGS (next-generation sequencing) and functional genomics technology has facilitated the discovery of lncRNA in plant species. This review is a brief explanation of lncRNA genomics, its molecular role, and the mechanism of action in plants. The review also addresses the challenges encountered in this field and highlights promising molecular and computational methodologies that can aid in the comparative and functional analysis of lncRNAs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS.
