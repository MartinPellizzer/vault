Our results, obtained by starch-gel electrophoresis of 15 loci, show normal levels of variability for species with similar biology. The comparison with the patterns of genetic variability of two closely related species, H. balearica and H. grosii, confirms the taxonomic status of H. valentina as a proper species, independent of H. balearica, as previously suggested. The analysis of population subdivision shows that substantial variation among populations is present, and a hierarchical analysis demonstrates that when zones are defined according to their geographic location, a higher differentiation among populations within zones than among zones is found. Indirect estimates of gene flow indicate that levels of migration per generation are relatively low, except for a group composed of four populations, three of which are in close proximity. For the remaining populations, there is evidence of substantial differentiation. These results have implications for the design of a conservation strategy for this species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut Cavanilles de Biodiversitat i Biologia Evolutiva, Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia, Spain. fernando.gonzalez@uv.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Candelas", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Montol\u00edo", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Hered", "NlmUniqueID": "0375373", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1503"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Starch Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Frequency"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10768127", "10.1093/jhered/91.2.134"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
