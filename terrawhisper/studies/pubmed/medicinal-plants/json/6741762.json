Ten percent of these patients showed remarkable improvement in their volume of semen, 10% showed improvement and 80.0% showed no improvement. Thirty percent of these patients showed remarkable improvement in the number of sperm, 10.0% showed improvement, and 60.0% showed no improvement. Twenty percent of these patients showed remarkable improvement in their sperm mobility, 30.0% showed improvement and 50.0% showed no improvement. The fertility index was improved markedly in 60.0%, improved in 20.0% and not improved in 20.0%. The spouses of 2 patients became pregnant. Side effects were seen in only 30.0% (epigastralgia) of these patients. Laboratory examination of these patients revealed no significant change. These results suggested that concomitant administration of Ninjinto and Hachimijiogan is effective on patients with male infertility."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nishizawa", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Hinyokika Kiyo", "NlmUniqueID": "0421145", "ISSNLinking": "0018-1994"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Infertility, Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sperm Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sperm Motility"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6741762"]}}]}
