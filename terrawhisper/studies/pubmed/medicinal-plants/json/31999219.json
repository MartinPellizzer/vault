However, little is known about diseases that affect its health. In recent years, stem canker diseases on <i>C. paliurus</i> have been observed frequently in newly established nurseries in Jiangsu Province, China. Symptomatic trees showed elliptical, sunken lesions on the bark, with internal discoloration, leading to enlarging cankers with delineated margins. Pathogenicity tests with fungi isolated from symptomatic samples reproduced typical canker symptoms on both detached branches and potted plants of <i>C. paliurus</i>. Moreover, conidia from pycnidia of isolate ZB-23 could also cause stem canker on <i>C. paliurus</i>. Through combined morphological observation and DNA sequences of ITS region, \u03b2<i>-tubulin</i>, and <i>translation elongation factor 1</i>-\u03b1 genes, the pathogen was identified as <i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i>. Multigene maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony phylogenetic analyses further supported the identification of the pathogen. To our knowledge, this is the first report of <i>B. dothidea</i> causing stem canker on <i>C. paliurus</i> in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9574-9449"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, College of Forestry, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210037, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Xiang-Rong", "Initials": "XR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, College of Forestry, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210037, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Mao-Jiao", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, College of Forestry, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210037, China."}], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Xu-Lan", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, College of Forestry, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210037, China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Sheng-Zuo", "Initials": "SZ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2412-7607"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, College of Forestry, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210037, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Feng-Mao", "Initials": "FM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ascomycota"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virulence"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31999219", "10.1094/PDIS-11-18-1990-RE"]}}]}
