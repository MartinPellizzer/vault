Cognitive Behavioral Anti-insomnia therapies including benzodiazepines often face limitations due to patient adherence or potential adverse effects. This study focused on identifying novel bioactive compounds from medicinal plants, aiming to discover and develop new therapeutic agents with low risk-to-benefit ratios using computational drug discovery methods. Through a systematic framework involving compound library preparation, evaluation of drug-likeness and pharmacokinetics, toxicity prediction, molecular docking, and molecular dynamic simulations, two natural compounds such as 2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-8-methoxy-6-prop-2-enyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromen-3-ol from Ocimum tenuiflorum and 7-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-1,4a-dimethyl-9-oxo-3,4,10,10a-tetrahydro-2H-phenanthrene-1-carboxylic acid from Poria cocos exhibited high binding affinity with orexin receptor type 1 (OX1R) and type 2 (OX2R), surpassing commercial drugs used in insomnia treatment. Additionally, they showed interactions with critical amino acid residues within the receptors that play crucial roles in competitive inhibitor activity, like commercial drugs such as Suvorexant, Lemborexant, and Daridorexant. Further, molecular dynamics simulations of the protein-ligand complexes under conditions that mimic the in vivo environment revealed both compounds' sustained and robust interactions with the OX1R and OX2R, reinforcing their potential as effective therapeutic candidates. Furthermore, upon evaluating both compounds' drug-likeness, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity profiles, it was discerned that they displayed considerable drug-like properties and favorable pharmacokinetics, along with diminished toxicity. The research provides a solid foundation for further exploring and validating these compounds as potential anti-insomnia therapeutics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
