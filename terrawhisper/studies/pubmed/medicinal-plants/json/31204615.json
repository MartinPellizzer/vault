We investigated the antileukemia effects of different fractions of <i>Satureja hortensis</i> (Summer savory). The growth inhibitory effect of <i>S. hortensis</i> fractions on K562 and Jurkat leukemia cells were determined by MTT assay. The most effective fractions were analyzed by flow cytometry and colorimetric assay for apoptosis induction and cell cycle changes. Various fractions from <i>S. hortensis</i> showed growth inhibitory effects on leukemia cells, among them two hexane and dichloromethane fractions with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 32.1-47.8 \u03bcg/ml (K562) and 44.3-45.7 \u03bcg/ml (Jurkat) were the most effective. According to annexin V staining, both of these fractions significantly induced apoptosis at 50\u03bcg/ml in K562 (hexane; 73.06 \u00b1 5.11% and dichloromethane; 96.14 \u00b1 2.33%) and Jurkat cells (hexane; 78.85 \u00b1 11.9% and dichloromethane; 94.05 \u00b1 2.47%) 48 h after treatment. They increased cell accumulation in sub-G1 phase (>50%, <i>p</i> < .001) and decreased number of cells in G0-G1, S and G2M phases. The fractions significantly increased the caspase-3 activity in both cell lines (\u22482.5-3.5 fold of untreated cells). Hexane and dichloromethane fractions of <i>S. hortensis</i> had the capacity to induce death and change the cell cycle distribution in leukemia cells; therefore they might be good candidates for more studies in regard to their possible therapeutic usefulness in leukemia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunology Department, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences , Shiraz , Iran."}], "LastName": "Asadipour", "ForeName": "Morvarid", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunology Department, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences , Shiraz , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Autoimmune Diseases Research Center, and Medicinal and Natural Products Chemistry Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences , Shiraz , Iran."}], "LastName": "Amirghofran", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Immunoassay Immunochem", "NlmUniqueID": "100963688", "ISSNLinking": "1532-1819"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "588X2YUY0A", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylene Chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Death"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colorimetry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hexanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Jurkat Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "K562 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia, T-Cell"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Methylene Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Satureja"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31204615", "10.1080/15321819.2019.1629592"]}}]}
