The effects of the formulation and technics on drug release behavior were investigated by dissolution test. The erosion of coat layer during dissolution test was investigated.", "Drug almost not released in dissolution medium stimulating gastric and intestinal condition, and released completely by coating layer erosion and rupture by enzyme in stimulating colonic condition. Drug release decreased with decreasing the ratio of konjac glucomannan-HPMC and increasing coat weight (P < 0.05), compression force was not found to be a significant factor on drug release. Drug release increased with increasing the concentration of beta-mannase in dissolution medium (P < 0.05), rotation speed has no effect on drug release. The release of drug was correlative with erosion of coat layer.
