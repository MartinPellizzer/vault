Methanol extracts of the most common species cited were screened for cytotoxicity using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay in both exposure and recovery experiments. Three cancer cell lines (human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7, human large cell lung carcinoma cell line COR-L23 and human amelanotic melanoma C32) and one normal cell line (normal human keratinocytes SVK-14) were used for the screening of the extracts and the fractions obtained. The extract of Cajanus cajan showed considerable activity and was further partitioned and the dichloromethane fraction was subjected to preparative chomatography to yield six compounds: hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, alpha-amyrin, beta-sitosterol, pinostrobin, longistylin A and longistylin C. Pinostrobin and longistylins A and C were tested for cytotoxicity on the cancer cell lines. In addition, an adriamycin-sensitive acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia cell line (CCRF-CEM) and its multidrug-resistant sub-line (CEM/ADR5000) were used in an XTT assay to evaluate the activity of the pure compounds obtained.", "A total of 30 healers from S W Nigeria were involved in the study. 45 species were recorded with their local names with parts used in the traditional therapeutic preparations. Cytotoxicity (IC(50) values less than 50 microg/mL) was observed in 5 species (Acanthospermum hispidum, Cajanus cajan, Morinda lucida, Nymphaea lotus and Pycnanthus angolensis). Acanthospermum hispidum and Cajanus cajan were the most active. The dichloromethane fraction of Cajanus cajan had IC(50) value 5-10 microg/mL, with the two constituent stilbenes, longistylins A and C, being primarily responsible, with IC(50) values of 0.7-14.7 microM against the range of cancer cell lines.", "Most of the species tested had some cytotoxic effect on the cancer cell lines, which to some extent supports their traditional inclusion in herbal preparations for treatment of cancer. However, little selectivity for cancer cells was observed, which raises concerns over their safety and efficacy in traditional treatment. The longistylins A and C appear to be responsible for much of the activity of Cajanus cajan extract."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
