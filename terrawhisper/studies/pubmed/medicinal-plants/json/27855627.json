Particular attention was paid to curcumin - the major metabolite present in the extracts of Curcuma spp., which is known to exhibit a variety of pharmacological actions. Also, the characteristics of some semisynthetic analogues of this ferulic acid derivative, characterized by a higher polarity and better bioavailability will be discussed.", "Numerous scientific papers treat on the influence of turmeric on weight loss. Additionally, some of them describe its anti-inflammatory properties.", "This important spice tends to fight the 21st century plague, which is an excessive weight gain, related to the development of metabolic syndrome, to the occurrence of cardiovascular problems and diabetes, and, in consequence, leading to a significant shortening of life span. As herein proven, the extracts of turmeric play an important role in the regulation of inflammatory reactions which are evoked in the overweight patients, helping them reduce the excess body weight."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland, 1 Chodzki str., 20-093 Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Jarz\u0105b", "ForeName": "Agata", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy with Medicinal Plants Unit, Medical University of Lublin, Poland, 1 Chodzki str., 20-093 Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Kukula-Koch", "ForeName": "Wirginia", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Obesity Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "856YO1Z64F", "NameOfSubstance": "turmeric extract"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IT942ZTH98", "NameOfSubstance": "Curcumin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adipose Tissue"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Obesity Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Curcuma"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Curcumin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Tubers"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27855627", "10.2174/0929867324666161118095443", "CMC-EPUB-79795"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
