This is a manifestation of the full support of the Philippines for the principles and policies adopted by the UN body on the conservation of biodiversity, sustainable development of biological resources and equitable sharing of benefits between users and owners of biodiversity resources. The Philippine scientific community has long recognized the need for and importance of a national guideline and policy with regard to the collection of plants and animals in the Philippines for scientific or commercial purposes. A series of consultative meetings were held by representatives of government agencies, non-government organizations, private organizations, academic and private persons concerned with biodiversity conservation to formulate national guidelines that regulate the collection of plant and animal specimens in the country. Guidelines were unanimously adopted by various government agencies and academia and a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed on September 28, 1990. Very recently a new document was drafted, specifically to serve as a guideline for those who desire to undertake sample collecting in the Philippines for biodiversity prospecting. The document is now being reviewed by government departments and agencies and will be presented to the President of the Philippines for signing as an Executive Order (EO). Once signed, this EO will serve as a national policy for bioprospecting in the country. The Philippines is one of the countries in Southeast Asia that has endorsed the adoption of regional guidelines on the collection of plant and animal organisms for drug development. The ASEAN Agreement on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (1985). The Manila Declaration (1992) and lately, the Melaka Accord (1994), all of which were signed by various countries in Asia, are manifestations of this interest."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botany Division, National Museum, Manila, Philippines."}], "LastName": "Madulid", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Guideline", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethics"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Expeditions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Government Agencies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "International Cooperation"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Licensure"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacognosy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Philippines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Policy"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Specimen Handling"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9213618", "10.1016/0378-8741(95)01363-6", "0378-8741(95)01363-6"]}}]}
