Maytenus ilicifolia Mart.ex. Reiss, a plant native to parts of South America, has been used as a contraceptive, abortifacient, and emmenagogue by women in Paraguay and Argentina. The present study evaluated the effect of the ethanolic extract of Maytenus ilicifolia Mart.ex. Reiss leaves on spermatogenesis in Swiss mice. The extract was administered at doses of 200 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally for 20 days and 800 mg/kg/day orally for 30 days. Light microscopy revealed apparently normal spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules of treated animals. Although the spermatogenic process was not altered, ultrastructural alterations were observed, including some exfoliated immature germ cells, occasional germ cell death, and a few vacuolized seminiferous tubules. Enlarged lipid droplets were found in Sertoli cells and swollen acrosomes occurred in early spermatids of mice treated with the higher dose. However, sperm production indicated that the ethanolic extract did not contain substances sufficient to arrest spermatogenesis. Thus, the indigenous use of Maytenus ilicifolia as a medicinal plant probably does not cause a disturbance of spermatogenesis as a side effect."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["134948", "00277589"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: CONTRACEPTION."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Animals, Laboratory", "Biology", "Clinical Research", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Genitalia", "Genitalia, Male", "Health", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Physiology", "Plants, Medicinal", "Reproduction", "Research Methodology", "Research Report", "Spermatogenesis", "Testis", "Urogenital System"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "9673841", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1998", "Month": "09", "Day": "25"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "08", "Day": "26"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0010-7824", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "57", "Issue": "5", "PubDate": {"Year": "1998", "Month": "May"}}, "Title": "Contraception", "ISOAbbreviation": "Contraception"}, "ArticleTitle": "Effect of Maytenus ilicifolia Mart.ex.
