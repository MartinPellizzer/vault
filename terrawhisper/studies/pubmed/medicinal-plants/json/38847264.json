The ADME( T) studies were performed by SWISS ADME and ProTox-II.", "The top ten highest binding energy phytochemicals identified were amyrin acetate (- 10.7 kcal/mol), uscharine (-10.5 kcal/mol), voruscharin (-10.0 kcal/mol), cyclitols (-10.0 kcal/mol), taraxeryl acetate (-9.9 kcal/mol), amyrin (-9.9 kcal/mol), barringtogenol C (-9.9 kcal/mol), calactin (-9.9 kcal/mol), 3-beta taraxerol (-9.8 kcal/mol), and calotoxin (-9.8 kcal/mol). A molecular docking study revealed that these phytochemical constituents showed higher binding affinity compared to the reference standard tamoxifen (-6.6 kcal/mol) towards the target protein ER\u03b1. The results of MD studies showed that all four tested compounds possess comparatively stable ligand-protein complexes with ER\u03b1 target as compared to the tamoxifen- ER\u03b1 complex.", "Among the ten compounds, phytochemical amyrin acetate (triterpenoids) formed a more stable complex as well as exhibited greater binding affinity than standard tamoxifen. ADMET studies for the top ten phytochemicals showed a good safety profile. Additionally, these compounds are being reported for the first time in this study as possible inhibitors of ER\u03b1 for the treatment of breast cancer by adopting the concept of drug repurposing. Hence, these phytochemicals can be further studied and can be used as a parent core molecule to develop novel lead molecules for breast cancer therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Research Laboratory, MNR College of Pharmacy, Sangareddy, 502 294, India."}], "LastName": "Alagarsamy", "ForeName": "Veerachamy", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Research Laboratory, MNR College of Pharmacy, Sangareddy, 502 294, India."}], "LastName": "Sulthana", "ForeName": "Mohaideen Thasthagir", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Research Laboratory, MNR College of Pharmacy, Sangareddy, 502 294, India."}], "LastName": "Narendhar", "ForeName": "Bandi", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Research Laboratory, MNR College of Pharmacy, Sangareddy, 502 294, India."}], "LastName": "Solomon", "ForeName": "Viswas Raja", "Initials": "VR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Swathi College of Pharmacy, SPSR Nellore, 524 320, Andhra Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Gobinath", "ForeName": "Manavalan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Research Laboratory, MNR College of Pharmacy, Sangareddy, 502 294, India."}], "LastName": "Satishchandra", "ForeName": "Aithamraju", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Research Laboratory, MNR College of Pharmacy, Sangareddy, 502 294, India."}], "LastName": "Sangeetha", "ForeName": "Dubudam", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani Campus, Pilani, 333 031, India."}], "LastName": "Murugesan", "ForeName": "Sankaraanarayanan", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Comput Aided Drug Des", "NlmUniqueID": "101265750", "ISSNLinking": "1573-4099"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "55"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "55"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38847264", "10.2174/0115734099301866240527100128", "CAD-EPUB-140846"]}}]}
