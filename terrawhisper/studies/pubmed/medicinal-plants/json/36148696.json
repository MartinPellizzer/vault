Their structures were established on the basis of extensive analysis of NMR and HRESIMS data as well as by comparison with the reported data in the literature. All the isolates were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cell line. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited weak cytotoxicity with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 36.10 and 27.39\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. In addition, beesioside I (6) was found to significantly inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in HepG2 cells. A closer examination of underlying mechanism revealed that beesioside I could increase the levels of ROS and caspase-3 and promote phosphorylation of JNK in the JNK signaling pathway. Molecular modeling studies also shed further light on how beesioside I interacted with the key protein kinase."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
