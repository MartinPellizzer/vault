It is notorious that PAs are cause the hepatoxic and genotoxic-carcinogenic effects by taking PA-containing herbs, food and dietary supplements. In order to control the poisoning caused by PAs, European Medicines Agency has set a limit of intake of PAs from herbal medicinal products at 0.007 \u03bcg of 1,2-unsaturated PAs/kg body weight. Nonetheless, a systematic overview of the amount of PAs in the herb has not been provided. Therefore, this paper is to systematically review the current status of PAs content analysis of herbal medicines and foods reported in the literature, and to provide theoretical and experimental support for the safety risk assessment and control of PAs in Chinese herbal medicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100102, China Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Zhang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Si-Qi", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Fei-Fei", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Jian-Yong", "ForeName": "S I", "Initials": "SI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100102, China."}], "LastName": "Qing", "ForeName": "W U", "Initials": "WU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Yong-Hong", "ForeName": "Liao", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33350201", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200623.205"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
