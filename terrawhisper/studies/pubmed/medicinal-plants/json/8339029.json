A/D, PEP/LEVT, A/H were increased, while TRTI, DATI, HI, SV, CI reduced in 64 patients, 34 of them with coronary heart disease. The change was statistically significant. This study showed that DATI was more sensitive than PEP/LEVT in patients with HQIS, while there was no significant difference between abnormal ratio of them, overlapping of the two indices was showed. Replenishing Heart Mixture attained its therapeutic effect through improving abnormal left ventricular function. After treatment A/H, A/D, PEP/LEVT were reduced and DATI, SV, CI increased (P < 0.05-0.01). In experiment, HQIS was produced by acute myocardial ischemia in open-chest anesthetized dogs by left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. It has been shown that dp/dtmax and T were more sensitive than dp/dtmax. Result of the clinical and the experimental study were consistent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Affiliated Hospital of Hubei College of TCM, Wuhan."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Z X", "Initials": "ZX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "9211576", "ISSNLinking": "1003-5370"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Coronary Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diastole"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Echocardiography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetocardiography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ventricular Function, Left"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Yang Deficiency"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8339029"]}}]}
