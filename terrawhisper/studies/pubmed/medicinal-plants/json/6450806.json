Spleen cells activated in vitro in 5-day mixed leukocyte cultures (MLC) were incubated sequentially with VV, rabbit anti-V antiserum, and fluoresceinated sheep anti-rabbit IgG. When these stained MLC cells were passed on a flow cytometer gated to exclude nonviable cells and small lymphocytes, a single heterogeneous peak of fluorescence was seen, as compared to control MLC cells that had not been incubated with VV. Fluorescence of lymphoblasts was dependent upon lectin dose and was eliminated when staining was performed in the presence of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, the appropriate competitive sugar for VV. T cell blast populations activated against H-2, Mls, or parasite antigens all had comparable levels of fluorescence after staining with VV, although the cytolytic activity of these cells varied widely. Furthermore, when MLC lymphoblasts binding large or small amounts of VV were sorted on the basis of their relative fluorescence intensity and tested for cytolytic function, no appreciable difference in activity between the 2 populations was observed. These results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that VV binds selectively to cytolytic T lymphocytes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "MacDonald", "ForeName": "H R", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mach", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schreyer", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zaech", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cerottini", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "2985117R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1767"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KM15WK8O5T", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylgalactosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylgalactosamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6450806"]}}]}
