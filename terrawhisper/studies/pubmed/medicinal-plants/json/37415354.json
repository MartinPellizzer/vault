During a survey of nematodes in Vietnam, 1,106 samples from 22 different plant species were collected. <i>M. incognita</i> was recorded on 13 of the 22 host plants. Four populations of <i>M. incognita</i> from four host plants were chosen for comparison and confirmation of their morphologic, morphometric, and molecular characteristics. Genetically based phylogenetic trees were constructed to show relationships among root-knot nematodes. Molecular barcodes of four gene regions, ITS, D2-D3 of 28S rRNA, <i>COI</i>, and <i>Nad5</i> mtDNA, integrated with morphologic and morphometric data were used as reliable references for molecular identification of <i>M. incognita</i>. Our analyses indicated that tropical root-knot nematodes are very similar in characterization of ITS, D2-D3 of 28S rRNA, and <i>COI</i> regions. However, these gene regions can be used to separate the tropical root-knot nematode group from other groups. On the other hand, the analysis of <i>Nad5</i> mtDNA and multiplex-PCR with specific primers can be used to distinguish tropical species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources, Vietnam Academy of Sciences and Technology, 100000 Hanoi, Vietnam."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate University of Science and Technology, Vietnam Academy of Sciences and Technology, 100000 Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Trinh", "ForeName": "Quang Phap", "Initials": "QP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources, Vietnam Academy of Sciences and Technology, 100000 Hanoi, Vietnam."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate University of Science and Technology, Vietnam Academy of Sciences and Technology, 100000 Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Le", "ForeName": "Thi Mai Linh", "Initials": "TML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources, Vietnam Academy of Sciences and Technology, 100000 Hanoi, Vietnam."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate University of Science and Technology, Vietnam Academy of Sciences and Technology, 100000 Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Nguyen", "ForeName": "Thi Duyen", "Initials": "TD"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9476-935X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources, Vietnam Academy of Sciences and Technology, 100000 Hanoi, Vietnam."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate University of Science and Technology, Vietnam Academy of Sciences and Technology, 100000 Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Nguyen", "ForeName": "Huu Tien", "Initials": "HT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 28S"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Mitochondrial"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Tylenchoidea"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vietnam"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 28S"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Mitochondrial"}], "CoiStatement": "The author(s) declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37415354", "10.1094/PDIS-04-23-0818-SR"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
