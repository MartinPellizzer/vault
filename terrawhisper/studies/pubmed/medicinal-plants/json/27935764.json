Many herbal medicines, among them extracts from plants of Rhodiola genus, have antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and immunostimulatory properties owing to their polyphenol content; they may, however, affect fetal development due to their antiangiogenic properties. The aim of this study was to explain whether daily feeding pregnant and lactating mice with 20\u2009mg/kg Rhodiola kirilowii aqueous (RKW) or 50% hydro-alcoholic (RKW-A) extracts, or 0.2\u2009mg/kg epigallocatechin (EGC, antiangiogenic compound of Rhodiola extracts), may lead to abnormalities in morphology and function of the kidneys of adult progeny. Such abnormalities were not observed in the kidneys of 6-week-old offspring, neither in RKW nor in the control group. However, the progeny of RKW-A- or EGC-fed mothers presented morphometric abnormalities in the kidney structure, with a significantly higher number of glomeruli/mm<sup>2</sup> and a lower diameter of glomeruli (RKW-A group) or a significantly higher glomeruli diameter (EGC), than in the control and RKW groups. Abnormalities in serum vascular endothelial growth factor, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, urea, creatinine, and cystatin C levels were also found. We recommend caution in long-term use of RKW-A extract and EGC-rich foods during pregnancy and lactation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Regenerative Medicine, Military Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology , Warsaw, Poland ."}], "LastName": "Lewicki", "ForeName": "S\u0142awomir", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Department of Microwave Safety, Military Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology , Warsaw, Poland ."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Pathomorphology Department, Center for Biostructure Research; Warsaw Medical University , Warsaw, Poland ."}], "LastName": "Skopi\u0144ska-R\u00f3\u017cewska", "ForeName": "Ewa", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4 Department of Immunology, Biochemistry and Nutrition; Warsaw Medical University , Warsaw, Poland ."}], "LastName": "Ba\u0142an", "ForeName": "Barbara Joanna", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "5 Department of Pediatrics, Nephrology and Allergology, Military Institute of Medicine , Warsaw, Poland ."}], "LastName": "Kalicki", "ForeName": "Boles\u0142aw", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "6 Department of Pathology, Military Institute of Medicine , Warsaw, Poland ."}], "LastName": "Patera", "ForeName": "Janusz", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "7 Department of Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Warsaw University of Life Sciences , Poland, Warsaw, Poland ."}], "LastName": "Wilczak", "ForeName": "Jacek", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "8 Pathomorphology Department, National Institute of Geriatrics , Rheumatology and Rehabilitation, Warsaw, Poland ."}], "LastName": "Wasiuty\u0144ski", "ForeName": "Aleksander", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Regenerative Medicine, Military Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology , Warsaw, Poland ."}], "LastName": "Zdanowski", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cystatin C"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AYI8EX34EU", "NameOfSubstance": "Creatinine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Creatinine"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cystatin C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lactation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Complications"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rhodiola"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27935764", "10.1089/jmf.2016.0126"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
