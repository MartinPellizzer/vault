It also evaluated the antiplasmodial activity of the morphological parts of Kigelia africana (Lam.) Benth., and isolated, as well as characterised pure compounds from the semi-purified fractions of the fruit extract.", "The ethnomedicinal survey was conducted using semi-structured questionnaires administered to only herb sellers in Iwo, Ile-Ogbo, Olupona, and Ogbagba areas of Osun State. Extracts of K. africana morphological parts; leaf, root, stem bark, and fruit were obtained by cold maceration in methanol, followed by assessment of acute toxicity (LD<sub>50</sub>) and antiplasmodial activity in Plasmodium berghei infected rats using the 4-day suppressive test model. The most active fruit extract was further subjected to activity-guided fractionation and purification using n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate (EtOAc), n-butanol (n-BuOH), and methanol (MeOH) in gradients to obtain the semi-purified fractions and two pure isolated compounds using various chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques.", "From the survey, thirty-one plant species were identified for treating malaria in Iwo area. Azadirachta indica leaf was the most frequently used (78.3% of the respondents) while Manihot esculenta leaf (3.33%) was the least. The identified plants are distributed among 24 families, with Anacardiaceae and Asteraceae (11.67% each) been the most occurring families. Kigelia africana (Bignoniaceae) ranked the 6th position with 60% frequency of occurrence. The LD<sub>50</sub> values obtained for the extracts were greater than 5000\u00a0mg/kg (p.o). The chemo-suppression activity of the extracts at 125\u00a0mg/kg was in the order of stem bark (26.59%), leaf (41.75%), root (43.95%), and fruit (54.54%). The semi-purified methanol fraction of the fruit showed the most antiplasmodial activity with a percent chemo-suppression of 69.94 and yielded 4-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)-3,5-dihydroxy-5-methylfuran-2-one and sucrose.", "The use of herbs and medicinal plants either singly or in combination for the treatment of malaria among the people of Iwo community in Nigeria is still well practised. Lack of formal education among most of the respondents and use of same local name for different plants species or plant parts; which often lead to wrong plant collection were among the constrains encountered.
