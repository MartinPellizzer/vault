Tuning the gelatin nanoparticle concentration or AM content led to different porous structures with void diameters varying between 30 and 78 \u03bcm. More importantly, keeping HIPEs at room temperature to undergo a limited kinetic coarsening before polymerization could greatly improve the interconnectivity and pore size of the scaffolds, with the average diameters (approx. 118 \u03bcm) being enlarged 1.5-fold. Additionally, the scaffolds had a character of soft tissue with compressive modulus more than 150 kPa. The cell culture assay confirmed that HepG2 cells not only could adsorb on but also were grown inside the scaffolds, representing a characteristic of the good biocompatibility of the scaffolds. Our work suggests that the 3D scaffolds fabricated from gelatin nanoparticle-stabilized HIPE templates are promising culture substrates for a wide range of applications in the biomedical field."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, Sichuan Industrial Institute of Antibiotics, Chengdu University, Chengdu, 610052, P.
