An increasing number of reports suggest the function of natural antioxidant protection of phenolic compounds in plant growth and development processes. Due to the antioxidant functions, flavonoids allow plants to respond to abiotic or biotic stresses. As one of the plants rich in secondary metabolites, Catharanthus roseus has drawn great academic interest due to its richness of diverse secondary metabolites with medicinal values. To assess the distribution and function of phenolic compounds during cotyledon greening, combined phenolic profiling and transcriptome were applied in C. roseus seedling through ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) and high throughput RNA sequencing, respectively. Results herein showed that light-exposed greening cotyledon accumulated large amounts of C6C3C6-type flavonoids, suggesting the function in repressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to improve light adaptation and seedling survival. Moreover, synergistic up-regulation of relevant genes involved in flavonoids pathway, including PAL, C4H, CHS, FLS, and F3'H, was monitored in response to light. Several crucial candidate transcription factors including bHLH, MYB, and B-box families were likely to function, and thereinto, CrHY5 (CRO_T122304) and CRO_T137938 revealed a prompt response to light, supposing to induce flavonoids accumulation by targeting CHS and FLS. Therefore, this study provided new insight into the potential regulation and underlying roles of flavonoids to improve light acclimation during cotyledon greening."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.
