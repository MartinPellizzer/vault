The present study aimed to delineate the mechanism of such interaction for safe usage of carbamazepine during epilepsy control.", "The effect of piperine on carbamazepine hepatic metabolism was examined using rat or human liver microsomes. Mechanistic static model was applied to predict the extent of interaction. In addition, liver microsomal activities, mRNAs and protein expressions of genes regulating carbamazepine metabolism were evaluated after two weeks oral administrations of 3.5 and 35\u202fmg/kg piperine in rats. Moreover, the effect of piperine on the xenobiotic receptor constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) was further accessed.", "Time-dependent inhibitory effect of piperine on carbamazepine metabolism was observed, with k<sub>inact</sub> and K<sub>I</sub> of 0.0153\u202fmin<sup>-1</sup> and 18.34\u202f\u03bcM for rat, and 0.0093\u202fmin<sup>-1</sup> and 9.45\u202f\u03bcM for human. Based on such in-vitro metabolic parameters, further estimation using mechanistic static model indicated that piperine could increase the AUC of CBZ by 7% and 11% in rat and human, respectively. Significant inhibition on rat liver microsomal activity, Cyp3a2 mRNA and protein expression, CAR mRNA were demonstrated with piperine at 35\u202fmg/kg. Yet, no direct effect on the activity of CAR for piperine was found.", "We have demonstrated the time-dependent inhibition by piperine on carbamazepine metabolism as the interaction mechanism. Prolonged use of piperine at high dose could increase carbamazepine concentrations through inhibiting metabolic enzyme activities and their related genes expressions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
