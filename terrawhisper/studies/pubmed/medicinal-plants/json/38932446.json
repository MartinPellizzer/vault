However, soil-borne pathogens have emerged as a serious threat to the cultivation of glory lily, leading to substantial economic losses in the southern parts of India. Among these, the three major pathogens are Macrophomina phaseolina, Fusarium oxysporum, and Agroathelia rolfsii, causing dry root rot (also referred to as charcoal rot), wilt, and stem rot, respectively. Here, we characterised these pathogens using morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences related to the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of ribosomal DNA, calmodulin (CAL) and translation elongation factor (TEF)-1\u03b1. Further, in the pathogenicity tests, the inoculation of M. phaseolina alone resulted in lesions measuring 7.54\u00b10.01 mm on tubers and 90% seedling mortality. This severity was comparable to the simultaneous inoculation of all three pathogens, indicating the prominence of dry root rot among soil-borne diseases. This study marks the first detailed investigation of soil-borne pathogens combined infection in G. superba, contributing to the understanding of fungal disease complexity in medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Department of Plant Pathology, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; dshanmugapriya0601@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Dhanabalan", "ForeName": "Shanmuga Priya", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Department of Plant Pathology, Agriculture College and Research Institute, Vazhavachanur, Tamil Nadu, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Southern Queensland, Centre for Crop Health, Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia; karthikeyan.m@tnau.ac.in."}], "LastName": "Muthusamy", "ForeName": "Karthikeyan", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Department of Plant Pathology, TNAU, Coimbatore, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India, 641003; johnsonpath@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "Iruthayasamy", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Department of Plant Pathology, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; vkparthiban@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Kumaresan", "ForeName": "Parthiban V", "Initials": "PV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Department of Floriculture and Landscape, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; rjmanicbe@rediffmail.com."}], "LastName": "Kandasamy", "ForeName": "Rajamani", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Centre for Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; senthil_natesan@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Natesan", "ForeName": "Senthil", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Southern Queensland, School of Agriculture and Environmental Science, Centre for Crop Health, Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia, 4350; sambasivam.periyannan@unisq.edu.au."}], "LastName": "Periyannan", "ForeName": "Sambasivam", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38932446", "10.1094/PDIS-03-24-0496-RE"]}}]}
