All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of herbal medicine used to treat dumping syndrome patients were included and meta-analyzed. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. <b>Results:</b> A total of 174 dumping syndrome patients of 3 trials met all inclusion criteria. Two trials assessed the effectiveness of herbal medicine on the symptom response rate compared with conventional pharmacotherapy. Their results suggested significant effects in favor of herbal medicine (risk ratio [RR] = 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16-1.63, <i>P</i> = .0003, heterogeneity \u03c4<sup>2</sup> = 0, \u03c7<sup>2</sup> = 0.02, <i>P</i> = .88, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0%). One trial assessed its effectiveness on the improvement rate of overall symptoms compared with conventional conservative complex therapy, such as postural management, diet regulation, and counseling (RR = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.96-1.58). <b>Conclusions:</b> Due to the small sample size, scarcity of reported articles, and lack of quality of the current RCTs, it was concluded that the effectiveness of herbal medicine in treating dumping syndrome is unclear."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5218-3959"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dongguk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ilsan Oriental Hospital, Dongguk University Medical Centre, Goyang-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Seungcheol", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mirae Korean Medicine Clinic, Cheonan-si, Chungcheongnam-do, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Bongki", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Noh", "ForeName": "Hyeonseok", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dongguk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ilsan Oriental Hospital, Dongguk University Medical Centre, Goyang-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Dong-Jun", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Integr Cancer Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "101128834", "ISSNLinking": "1534-7354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dumping Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality of Life"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</b> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Hertz AF., IV The cause and treatment of certain unfavorable after-effects of gastro-enterostomy.
