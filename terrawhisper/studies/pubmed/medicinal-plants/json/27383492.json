Initially, during detoxification of alcohol, all groups were orally dosed to 22% alcohol (6ml/kg body weight) along with different concentrations of heat-treated cucumber juice (10, 100 and 500mg/kg) and commercial goods for hangover-removal on sale (2ml/kg). Cucumber juice was dosed before 30 min, and simultaneously after 30min of alcohol administration, and its hepatoprotective effect on blood alcohol levels and hepatic alcohol metabolic enzyme system in experimental rats was evaluated. As a result, after 7h, remarkable reduction was found in the blood alcohol levels for all concentrations of cucumber juice treatment. Treatment with cucumber juice resulted in increasing dehydrogenase (ADH) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzymatic activities in rat liver at 9h after alcohol administration thereby stimulated blood alcohol metabolism as compared with control group. The effect of heat-treated cucumber juice on alcohol detoxification was observed only in the rats treated before 30min from alcohol administration. These findings indicate that heat-treated cucumber juice has significant protective effect on alcohol detoxification in experimental rats, suggesting its usefulness in the treatment of liver injury caused by alcohol consumption."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk South Korea."}], "LastName": "Bajpai", "ForeName": "Vivek K", "Initials": "VK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oriental Pharmacy, Wonkwang University, Iksan-city, Jeonbuk, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Na-Hyung", "Initials": "NH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, College of Engineering, Daegu University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Ji-Eun", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biotechnology, College of Environmental and Bioresource Sciences, Chonbuk National University, Gobong-ro, Iksan-si, Joellabuk-do (Jeonbuk), Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Kangmin", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, College of Engineering, Daegu University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Sun Chul", "Initials": "SC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Alcohol Content"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Alcohol Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.2.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehyde Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.2.1.5", "NameOfSubstance": "aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+)"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehyde Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Alcohol Content"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cucumis sativus"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit and Vegetable Juices"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inactivation, Metabolic"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27383492"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
