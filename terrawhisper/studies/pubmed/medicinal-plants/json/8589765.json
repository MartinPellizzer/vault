Another group of MSG obese mice were fed with 1-ephedrine (1-E) + d-pseudoephedrine (d-PE) of equivalent amounts as contained in TJ-62 (4.7%) for 8 weeks. Yet another group of MSG obese mice were further supplemented with Glycyrrhizae Radix (GR) extract + Forsythiae Fructus (FF) extract + Schizonepetae Spica (SS) extract (that inhibited phosphodiesterase activity) of amounts contained in TJ-62 (4.7%) for 8 weeks.", "The following were measured: The concentration of ephedrine and its congeners in TJ-62; the inhibitory effect of TJ-62 on phosphodiesterase activity; body weight; food intake; retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (RWAT) weight; interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) weight; mitochondrial protein content in IBAT; cytochrome c oxidase activity in IBAT; guanosine-5'-diphosphate (GDP) binding in IBAT mitochondria.", "One gram of TJ-62 contained 3.33 mg of 1-E and 0.73 mg of d-PE. One mg of TJ-62 was equivalent to 2.5 mg of caffeine in the inhibitory effect on phosphodiesterase activity. After feeding with TJ-62, GDP binding was significantly increased in a dose dependent manner. Body weight and RWAT weight decreased in both MSG obese mice and lean controls. Food intake was not changed by TJ-62. Feeding with 1-E + d-PE produced responses of about 70% of those of TJ-62. These responses were, furthermore, enhanced by the addition of the three extracts to the levels that were similar to those produced by TJ-62.", "Bofu-tsusho-san (TJ-62) works via activating the BAT thermogenesis and inhibiting the phosphodiesterase activity in mice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yoshida", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sakane", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wakabayashi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Umekawa", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kondo", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord", "NlmUniqueID": "9313169"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "bofu-tsusho-san"}, {"RegistryNumber": "146-91-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Guanosine Diphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.9.3.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Electron Transport Complex IV"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GN83C131XS", "NameOfSubstance": "Ephedrine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "W81N5U6R6U", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Glutamate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Adipose Tissue"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Body Composition"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Body Temperature Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport Complex IV"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ephedrine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Guanosine Diphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Obese"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Glutamate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8589765"]}}]}
