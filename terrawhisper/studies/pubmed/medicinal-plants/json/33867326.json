After feeding high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks, Sprague-Dawley rats were received different doses of shikonin (5mg/kg/day, 10mg/kg/day and 20mg/kg/day) by gavage for the last 12 weeks of a total of 22 weeks of a HFD. Our results showed that total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerol (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were significantly increased, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was decrease, accompanied by hepatic injury and lipid accumulation in HFD-fed rats. Shikonin treatment attenuated the above biochemical and histopathological changes. Similarly, HFD-induced the increase of hepatic TC and TG levels were also ameliorated by shikonin treatment. Furthermore, shikonin observably mitigated HFD-induced the liver fibrosis and the increase of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, connective tissue growth factor, collagen III and IV expression. Additionally, shikonin markedly inhibited HFD-induced the decrease of proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) and matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) expression and the increase of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) expression in liver tissue. This study demonstrates that shikonin ameliorates hepatic lipid dysregulation and fibrosis through PPAR\u03b3 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 axis, suggesting that shikonin may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of NAFLD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Hospital, Zhejiang, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Weijia", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Hospital, Zhejiang, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Minchun", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Hospital, Zhejiang, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Hospital, Zhejiang, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Yelin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Hospital, Zhejiang, China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Xuanxuan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Hospital, Zhejiang, China."}], "LastName": "Teng", "ForeName": "Long", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Hospital, Zhejiang, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthoquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "PPAR gamma"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "TIMP1 protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3IK6592UBW", "NameOfSubstance": "shikonin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.35", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.35", "NameOfSubstance": "Mmp9 protein, rat"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Boraginaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Diet, High-Fat"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Cirrhosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "PPAR gamma"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "10"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33867326"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
