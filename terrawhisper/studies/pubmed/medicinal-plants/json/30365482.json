However, cardiac protection effects and the underlying mechanism for clinical application are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the potential anti-myocardial fibrosis effect and mechanism of SalB on Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiac fibrosis in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS The proliferation and migration capacity of cardiac fibroblasts (CFBs) were measured by MTT assay and scratch analysis, respectively. The colorimetric assay determined the hydroxyproline content in medium. Western blotting detected the protein expressions of nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathway-associated proteins, fibronectin (FN), collagen type I (Coll I), \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). The expression of \u03b1-SMA protein was observed by immunofluorescence staining. qRT-PCR detected the mRNA expression of NF-\u03baB. RESULTS SalB attenuated Ang II-induced the proliferation and the migration ability of CFBs. Ang II-induced the extracellular matrix protein Coll I, FN, and \u03b1-SMA, the pro-fibrotic cytokine CTGF protein expression was inhibited, and the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 subunit was reduced by SalB. Western blotting and qRT-PCR confirmed that SalB blocked the activation of NF-\u03baB induced by Ang II. PDTC (the NF-\u03baB inhibitor) also inhibited proliferation of CFBs and reduced \u03b1-SMA and Coll I expression induced by Ang II. CONCLUSIONS SalB can alleviate Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis via suppressing the NF-\u03baB pathway in vitro."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [],
