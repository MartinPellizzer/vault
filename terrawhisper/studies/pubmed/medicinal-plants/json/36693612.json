Therefore, it is important to understand the molecular mechanism of plants response to abiotic stress. In this study, we identified a plant specific protein AtSIEK (stress-induced protein with EXD1-like domain and KH domain) response to salt stress. AtSIEK encodes a hnRNP K homology (KH) protein localized in nucleus. Amino acid sequences analysis found that SIEK protein is specific in plants, containing two domains with EXD1-like domain and KH domain, while SIEK homolog in animals only had EXD1-like domain without KH domain. Physiology experiments revealed that AtSIEK was significantly induced under salt stress and the siek mutant shows sensitive to salt stress, indicating that AtSIEK was a positive regulator in stress response. Further, molecular, biochemical, and genetic assays suggested that AtSIEK interacts with FRY2/CPL1, a known regulator in response to abiotic stress, and they function synergistically in response to salt stress. Taken together, these results shed new light on the regulation of plant adaption to abiotic stress, which deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of abiotic stress regulation in plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
