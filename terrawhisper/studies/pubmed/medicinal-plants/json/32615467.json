Their chemical structures were unambiguously determined through comprehensive spectral data analyses. The antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects of all these isolated prenylated chromones and flavonoids were evaluated in vitro. As a result, compounds 1-12 showed notable inhibitory effects against various human cancer cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 to 22.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16\u00a0\u03bcM. Meanwhile, compounds 1-12 exhibited significant inhibitory activities on nitric oxide (NO) production holding IC<sub>50</sub> values in the range of 0.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05-19.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.21\u00a0\u00b5M. These research results suggest that the isolation and characterization of these prenylated chromones (1-7) and flavonoids (8-12) holding significant antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory activities could be significant to the discovery and development of new natural anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory drugs. The findings also provides a phytochemical evidence for further development and utilization of the stems and leaves of A. heterophyllus in health and pharmaceutical products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
