New sources for discovery of potentially novel immunomodulatory compounds are therefore needed. Nature contains a large and diverse reservoir of novel compounds that can be exploited for their potential as new drugs, and exploring the pharmaceutical potential of medicinal plants used in traditional medicine is highly relevant.", "We aimed with this study to explore usage of medicinal plants in Scandinavian folk medicine against diseases interpreted to involve the immune system, and to further screen water extracts from previously overlooked medicinal plants in order to discover potential new sources of immunomodulatory compounds.", "We systematically investigated historical records dating back to the 1800s with an emphasis on plants used as treatment for wounds or diseases interpreted to be inflammatory. Of 74 candidate plants, 23 pharmacologically under-studied species were selected for further characterization. The plants were collected from their natural habitats in Southern Norway, air-dried, and subjected to boiling water and accelerated solvent extraction. The crude extracts were separated into polysaccharide-enriched fractions and C-18 solid phase extracted fractions. Immunological screenings were performed with all extracts and fractions. Monosaccharide composition and total phenolic content were determined and compared across all species.", "We identified 10 species with clear immune activating effects and 8 species with immune inhibitory effects by comparing cytokine production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, primary human T- and NK-cell proliferation, and nitric oxide production from macrophages.", "With this study, we provide a comprehensive overview of Scandinavian medicinal plants and their usage, and our findings support an approach of combining historical sources with modern pharmacology in the discovery of plant sources containing potentially new pharmacological compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
