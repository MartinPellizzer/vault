Systematic analysis of the components appearing in the urine was carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with normal- and reversed-phase modes in combination. beta-D-glucuronidase-treated urine was subjected to rapid-flow fractionation (RFF) to achieve fractional extraction of lipophilic components with exhaustive recovery rates. The extracts were analysed by HPLC equipped with a multi-channel UV-detector. In the first stage of HPLC, we conducted a normal-phase mode run to find magnolol derived from Magnolia officinalis, as the most hydrophobic component showing minimum retention time among the urinary products of Saiboku-To. In the next stage, mobile phase solvent composition for reversed-phase HPLC was optimized so as to retain magnolol up to 60 min. Under these conditions, other Saiboku-To urinary products, which were more polar than magnolol, appeared within 60 min. Our HPLC method used marker compounds like magnolol and could indicate the terminal peak position on the reversed-phase chromatography. We found a total of eight components in the post-administrative Saiboku-To urine. Structure identification of the isolated pure materials was achieved using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-, mass (MS)- and UV-spectra, and HPLC retention profiles. They were magnolol and 8,9-dihydroxydihydromagnolol stemming from M. officinalis, medicarpin and liquiritigenin from Glycyrrhiza glabra, baicalein, wogonin, and oroxylin A from Scutellaria baicalensis, and davidigenin of an unknown origin. The pharmacological mystery of Saiboku-To should be disclosed by resolving the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these urinary products independently and synergistically."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Tokyo University of Pharmacy & Life Science, Japan."}], "LastName": "Homma", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oka", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Taniguchi", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Niitsuma", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hayashi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Histamine H1 Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "saiboku-to"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "analysis", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacokinetics", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine H1 Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Kampo"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9192103", "10.1002/(SICI)1099-0801(199705)11:3<125::AID-BMC631>3.0.CO;2-L", "10.1002/(SICI)1099-0801(199705)11:3<125::AID-BMC631>3.0.CO;2-L"]}}]}
