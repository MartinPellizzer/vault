Essential oils comprised of aldehyde as a functional group are potent in deciphering flavor effects in beverages and fresh and prepared food products. In the majority, these are manufactured through synthetic routes, resulting in high product carbon footprints or CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents in total greenhouse gas emission. FDA has banned some of the synthetic flavor chemicals due to the health hazards associated with them. However, consumer's preference for natural is at stake due to the absence of quantitative traceability tools. The accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) analysis revealed a distinction between natural and fossil-derived citral and its blends in Cymbopogon essential oils. The plant-derived citral contained a percent modern carbon (pMC) value in the range of 99-100\u00a0%. In contrast, the fossil fuel-derived citral showed zero pMC. Similarly, blends of Cymbopogon oils with 30-50\u00a0% (w/w) of fossil origin citral contained pMC equivalent to the proportions of modern carbon. These results showed the usefulness of AMS in quantifying the amount of <sup>14</sup>C associated with flavor ingredients. Besides, acute oral toxicity data revealed Cymbopogon oils as the safe flavoring substance at the highest 2000\u00a0mg/kg body weight dose in Swiss albino mice."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
