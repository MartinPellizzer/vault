However, due to unscrupulous vendors and imperfect market supervision mechanisms, curative foods are prone to adulteration or some other events that harm the interests of consumers. However, traditional analytical methods are unsuitable and expensive for a broad and complex application. Therefore, people urgently need a fast, efficient, and accurate detection method to protect self-interests. Recently, the study of target samples by vibration spectrum shows strong qualitative and quantitative ability. The model established by platform technology combined with the stoichiometric analysis method can obtain better parameters, which it has good robustness and can detect functional food efficiently, quickly and nondestructive. The review compared and prospect five different vibrational spectroscopic techniques (near-infrared, Fourier transform infrared, Raman, hyperspectral imaging spectroscopy and Terahertz spectroscopy). In order to better solve some of the actual situations faced by certification, we explore and through relevant research and investigation to appropriately highlight the applicability and importance of technology combined with chemometrics in functional food authentication. There are four categories of authentication discussed: functional food authenticated in source, processing method, fraud and ingredient ratio. This paper provides an innovative process for the authentication of functional food, which has a meaningful reference value for future review or scientific research of relevant departments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Agriculture, Yunnan University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Fengjiao", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jinyu", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuanzhong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9004784", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8347"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Functional Food"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemometrics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vibration"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35533108", "10.1080/10408347.2022.2073433"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
