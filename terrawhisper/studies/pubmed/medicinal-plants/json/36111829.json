Their structures and stereochemistry were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses and quantum ECD calculations. All the compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activities against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> subsp<i>, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli</i> and insecticidal activity against <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> Hubner. Compounds <b>1-3</b> exhibited modest insecticidal activity against <i>H. armigera</i> Hubner."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key
