After 24 days the frequency of stems explants was up to 81%. Transformation was confirmed by the amplification of rolC genes from the hairy roots of S. viscidula. The results demonstrated that rolC genes could be expressed in hairy roots of S. viscidula. Under the 36 days suspension culture of S. viscidula hairy roots in 1/2MS medium, dry weight of hairy root increased 17.42 times, the content and baicalin increased 21.60 and 25.56 times.", "The establishment of the culturing system of hairy root of S. viscidula provided a foundation for further industrial production of active drug component."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Eco-environments in Three Gorges Reservoir Region Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shu-fang", "Initials": "SF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Yi-ming", "Initials": "YM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "347Q89U4M5", "NameOfSubstance": "baicalin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Agrobacterium tumefaciens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Scutellaria"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transformation, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18841761"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
