This method was successfully applied to quantify the changes in isoflavonoid constituents in white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) tissues: (a) young legumes (pods and seeds) during maturation, and (b) soaked, germinating seeds. In developing legumes, genistein and 2'-hydroxygenistein, as well as their prenylated derivatives, were present in the pods as the major components, together with minor amounts of glucosides, whereas only minute amounts of isoflavonoids were detectable in the ripening seeds. When soaked with water, mature lupin seeds which normally contain trace amounts of isoflavonoids, started rapidly to biosynthesize simple isoflavones and accumulate large amounts of genistein 7-O-glucoside and its 6\"-O-malonyl derivative. These dynamic changes are discussed in relation to the role of isoflavonoids in the lupin defense system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Bioscience, Faculty of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Katagiri", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ibrahim", "ForeName": "R K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tahara", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biosci Biotechnol Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9205717", "ISSNLinking": "0916-8451"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoflavones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycosylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Isoflavones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Prenylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10923779", "10.1271/bbb.64.1118"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
