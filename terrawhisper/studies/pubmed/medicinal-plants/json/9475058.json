A significant increase in body weight was observed in all groups except that fed ginger (group III). A significant decrease in blood glucose, serum total cholesterol and serum alkaline phosphatase were found in all groups, whereas serum triglycerides were decreased significantly only in group IV. Serum HDL-cholesterol was significantly increased only in groups III and IV. However, HDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol and atherogenic index were significantly decreased in animals fed with combination of the two, compared to garlic/ginger alone. Hence, a combination of garlic and ginger is much more effective in reducing blood glucose and serum lipids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry Department, University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "S B", "Initials": "SB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hematologic Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zingiberales"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9475058"]}}]}
