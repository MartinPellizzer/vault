Protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) was anticipated to play an important role in Rhizobium-legume symbiosis because nitrogenase is extremely oxygen sensitive. We deleted the sodA gene encoding the sole cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase (SOD) of Sinorhizobium meliloti. The resulting mutant, deficient in superoxide dismutase, grew almost normally and was only moderately sensitive to oxidative stress when free living. In contrast, its symbiotic properties in alfalfa were drastically affected. Nitrogen-fixing ability was severely impaired. More strikingly, most SOD-deficient bacteria did not reach the differentiation stage of nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. The SOD-deficient mutant nodulated poorly and displayed abnormal infection. After release into plant cells, a large number of bacteria failed to differentiate into bacteroids and rapidly underwent senescence. Thus, bacterial SOD plays a key protective role in the symbiotic process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique Mol\u00e9culaire des R\u00e9ponses Adaptatives, Institut Jacques Monod, CNRS-Universit\u00e9s Paris 6 and Paris 7, 2 place Jussieu 75251 Paris cedex 05, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Santos", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "H\u00e9rouart", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Puppo", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Touati", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Mol Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8712028", "ISSNLinking": "0950-382X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Symbiosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11115110", "10.1046/j.1365-2958.2000.02178.x", "mmi2178"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
