It involved a meticulous survey of a wide range of historical sources spanning approximately 1100 years and including medical and pharmacological literature, travelogues, geographical and agricultural literature, dictionaries, archives, the Genizah and other medieval sources. Our main goal was to arrive at a reconstruction of the unwritten materia medica of the medieval and Ottoman Levant. Of the many and varied medicinal substances on which we were able to extract information, we were able to identify 286. These are presented according to the following classification: 234 species of plants (81.8%); 27 species of animals (9.5%); 15 kinds of minerals (5.2%) and 10 substances of other or mixed origin (3.5%). Analysis of the data showed that the region under study served as the geographic origin of the majority of the substances, only a minority of the materials was imported. The main reason for this is the geographic location of the Levant as a junction between three continents, as a cultural meeting point and as trade center. Finally, our data revealed that the al-Sham region was an independent source of production and marketing of medicinal substances during the medieval and Ottoman periods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jordan Valley College, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lev", "ForeName": "Efraim", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 15th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 16th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 17th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 18th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Medieval"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "history"], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle East"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "history"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12007707", "10.1016/s0378-8741(02)00029-6", "S0378874102000296"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
