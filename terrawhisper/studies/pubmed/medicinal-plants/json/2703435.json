Gilts were randomly allotted to either a control sorghum grain-soybean meal diet or a diet in which a portion of the soybean meal was replaced with mung beans. In the first three seasons, gilts were fed diets in which the protein supplement was totally soybean meal or 89% mung beans (high level) and 11% soybean meal. In the last three seasons the level of mung beans in the supplemental protein was reduced to 61% mung beans with 39% soybean meal (moderate level). Feeding the high level of mung beans decreased (P less than .05) weight gain during gestation and reduced (P less than .05) weight loss during lactation compared with gilts fed the control diet or the moderate level of mung beans. Little difference was noted in litter size at birth, but litter size at 21 d for gilts fed moderate levels of mung beans was less (P less than .05) than for gilts fed the control diet or the high level of mung beans. Little difference was noted in survival rate to 21 or 42 d or individual and litter weights at birth and 21 d. Pig and litter weights at 42 d, however were reduced in gilts fed the high level of mung beans (P less than .05 and P less than .10, respectively) compared with the control diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oklahoma State University, Stillwater 74078."}], "LastName": "Luce", "ForeName": "W G", "Initials": "WG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maxwell", "ForeName": "C V", "Initials": "CV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Buchanan", "ForeName": "D S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bates", "ForeName": "R O", "Initials": "RO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Woltmann", "ForeName": "M D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Norton", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dietz", "ForeName": "G N", "Initials": "GN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Anim Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8003002", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8812"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Birth Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Litter Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2703435", "10.2527/jas1989.672329x"]}}]}
