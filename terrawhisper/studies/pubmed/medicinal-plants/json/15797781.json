Pragya-peya, a herbal drink and its 12 herbal constituents have been analyzed for 7 minor (Al, Ca, Cl, Mg, Na, K, P) and 15 trace (Ba, Br, Co, Cr, Cs, Fe, Hg, La, Mn, Rb, Sc, Se, Th, V, Zn) elements by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). The method involves thermal neutron irradiation in a reactor followed by counting at several intervals. Also Cd, Cu, Ni and Pb contents were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Elemental data were validated by simultaneously analysing reference materials (RMs) such as mixed Polish herbs (INCT-MPH-2) and peach leaves (SRM-1547). Sample homogeneity was tested by analysing samples from three different batches collected at different intervals. Pragya-peya has been found to be especially rich in several nutrient elements such as Ca, K, V, Fe, Mn, Se and Zn whereas no single constituent is enriched in all the nutrient elements. Concentrations of elements are discussed vis-a-vis their medicinal/therapeutic uses. Several elements such as Na, K, P, Ca, Fe, Co, and Zn seem to be well correlated in 12 constituent herbs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee 247667, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "A G C", "Initials": "AG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reddy", "ForeName": "A V R", "Initials": "AV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garg", "ForeName": "A N", "Initials": "AN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Biomed Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "8309336", "ISSNLinking": "0731-7085"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Beverages"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neutron Activation Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Atomic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15797781", "10.1016/j.jpba.2004.11.051", "S0731-7085(04)00640-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
