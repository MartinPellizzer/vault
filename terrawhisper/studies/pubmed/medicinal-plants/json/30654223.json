From a methanolic extract, two new ent-kaurane diterpenoids, wedtrilosides A and B (1 and 2), along with five known metabolites (3-7), were isolated from W. trilobata. The chemical structures of (1-7) were assigned via spectroscopic techniques (IR, 1D, 2D NMR and HR-QTOF-MS data) and chemical methods. The isolates were evaluated for \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities compared to the clinical drug acarbose. Among them, compounds 4, 6, and 7 showed the most potent against \u03b1-glucosidase enzyme with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 27.54\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.12, 173.78\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.37, and 190.40\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.01\u202f\u03bcg/mL. While moderate inhibitory effect against \u03b1-amylase was observed with compounds 6 and 7 (with IC<sub>50</sub>\u202f=\u202f181.97\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.62 and 52.08\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.56\u202f\u03bcg/mL, respectively). The results suggested that the antidiabetic properties from the leaves of W. trilobata are not simply a result of each isolated compound, but are due to other factors such as the accessibility of polyphenolic groups to \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase activities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
