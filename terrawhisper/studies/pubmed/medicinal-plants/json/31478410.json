Several studies have shown that the extract of <i>Teucrium polium (T. polium)</i> is effective in the treatment of diabetic and non-diabetic wounds, as well as burn wounds. The aim of current study was to assess the wound healing activity of <i>T. polium</i> extract ointment in diabetic rats. Sixty-four male Wistar rats were induced diabetes with alloxan injection (125 mg/kg) and surgical wound induced. The rats were divided into 8 groups of eight rats each: control group, eucerin group, phenytoin group, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% and 10% <i>T. polium</i> groups. The ointment was dressed on the wound twice a day. The process of wound healing was screened by macroscopy and digitalization on days 14 and 21 and until complete wound healing. There was no infection in the wounds of rats in any groups. The process of wounds healing of the 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, and 10% <i>T. polium</i> ointments, with phenytoin ointment and base ointment (eucerin) on day 14 and 21, showed that the significant difference between the treatment groups with 4% (P = 0.003), 5% (P = 0.001), 10% (P = 0.001) <i>T. polium</i> ointment and phenytoin ointment group (P = 0.001) compared to eucerin group. The results of this study showed that <i>T. polium</i> extract ointment with a 10% ointment accelerates the wound healing process in diabetic rats and is comparable to the phenytoin group."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Institute of Medicinal Plants, ACECR, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fallah Huseini", "ForeName": "Hasan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Institute of Medicinal Plants, ACECR, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abdolghaffari", "ForeName": "Amir Hossein", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Institute of Medicinal Plants, ACECR, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ahwazi", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Institute of Medicinal Plants, ACECR, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jasemi", "ForeName": "Eghbal", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Research Unit, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Faculty of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yaghoobi", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9725-3033"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ziaee", "ForeName": "Mojtaba", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Low Extrem Wounds", "NlmUniqueID": "101128359", "ISSNLinking": "1534-7346"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ointment Bases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Topical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Foot"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ointment Bases"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Teucrium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31478410", "10.1177/1534734619868629"]}}]}
