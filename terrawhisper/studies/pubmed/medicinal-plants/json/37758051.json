Currently, Buparvaquone is the sole effective naphthoquinone drug commercially available for its treatment. In our research, we delved into the potential of naturally occurring quinones as alternative treatments. We isolated two quinones, emodin and chrysophanol, from Rheum emodi Wall, and two more, embelin and lawsone, from Embelia ribes Burm.f. and Lawsonia inermis L. respectively. We assessed the anti-Theileria efficacy of these quinones in vitro using MTT and flow cytometric assays on T. annulata-infected bovine lymphocytes. Additionally, we evaluated their safety on uninfected bovine Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) and Vero cells. Emodin emerged as a promising candidate, exhibiting an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 4\u00a0\u03bcM, surpassing that of buparvaquone. Emodin also displayed relatively low LD<sub>50</sub> values of 1.74\u00a0mM against uninfected PBMC and 0.87\u00a0mM against Vero cells, suggesting potential safety. Remarkably, emodin demonstrated a high cell absorption rate of 71.32%. While emodin's efficacy and bioavailability are encouraging, further research is imperative to validate its safety and effectiveness for treating Tropical Bovine Theileriosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
