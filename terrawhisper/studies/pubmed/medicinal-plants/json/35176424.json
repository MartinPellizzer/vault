Their structures were characterized by the comprehensive analysis of their NMR, IR, UV, CD spectra and HRESIMS data. All the new compounds were evaluated for the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The results showed that compounds 1 and 2 had significant DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities, with the IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.32-3.20\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Compounds 2 and 3 exhibited the higher potency among all the new compounds in reducing TNF-\u03b1 production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
