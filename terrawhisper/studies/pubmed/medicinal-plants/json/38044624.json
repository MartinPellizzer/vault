The chemical synthesis of methoxyeugenol is accompanied by pollution issues, whereas extraction from plants is associated with problems such as low yield and high cost. The production of methoxyeugenol can be effectively addressed through an enzymatic approach. In this study, the acyltransferase genes of <i>Euphorbia lathyris</i> L. were screened by homologous alignment of the transcriptome data of <i>E. lathyris</i> in the late growth stage and the acyltransferase genes of the closely related plant species. The results showed that ElBAHD10 had the closest relationship with earlier reported ScCFAT and PhCFAT, which were found to catalyze the reaction of coniferyl alcohol to generate coniferyl acetate. The <i>ElBAHD10</i> gene was successfully cloned from <i>E. lathyris</i> and subsequently expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. The purified protein ElBAHD10 catalyzed the reaction of sinapyl alcohol with acetyl CoA and cinnamoyl CoA to form sinapyl acetate and sinapyl cinnamate, respectively. In contrast, the crude ElBAHD10 protein could catalyze sinapyl alcohol to directly generate methoxyeugenol. The recombinant <i>E. coli</i> strain expressing ElBAHD10 produced methoxyeugenol through whole-cell transformation. This study provides insights and lays the foundation for methoxyeugenol production through biosynthetic approaches."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [],
