The components included law enforcement, crop substitution, measures for treatment and rehabilitation and a nationwide programme for drug education. The overall effort was co-ordinated by the Ministry of Home and Religious Affairs, through a Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control on which the Deputy Ministers of the Ministries concerned were members. Liaison between the executing Burmese agencies and the United Nations assisting organizations was effected through a small United Nations office established in Rangoon. The promising result of the programme has led to a further Agreement between the government and the United Nations for the continuation of the programme for a further five years from May 1981."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zealey", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Bull Narc", "NlmUniqueID": "2984719R", "ISSNLinking": "0007-523X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["economics"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cannabis"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug and Narcotic Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Education"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Myanmar"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "rehabilitation", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Opioid-Related Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Papaver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Substance-Related Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United Nations"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6461372"]}}]}
