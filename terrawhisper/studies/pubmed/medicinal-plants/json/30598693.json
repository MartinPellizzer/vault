Despite of the chemotherapeutic agents, many cancer patients still take traditional Chinese herbal prescriptions as adjuvant treatments. However, most of these herbal formulae/products lack of evidence-based efficacy. Based on our previous investigations on anti-tumor, anti-angiogenic, anti-metastatic, bone protective and immunomodulating activities of various Chinese herbal medicines, four constituent herbs, namely <i>Andrographis paniculata</i>, <i>Acanthopanax senticosus</i>, <i>Camellia sinensis</i>, and <i>Hedyotis diffusa</i> were eventually selected to form an innovative herbal formula.", "The anti-tumor efficacies of the formula were evaluated in metastatic breast cancer mice model. The bone protective and immunomodulatory effects were also assessed after formula treatment.", "Our results showed that the breast tumor weight as well as lung and liver metastasis in mice could be reduced after herbal formula treatment for 4\u00a0weeks. The breast tumor-induced osteolysis in mice was restored by herbal formula treatment, in which the bone volume in treated mice tibia was comparable to that in the non-tumor bearing normal mice. The IL-12 level was augmented and the survival of mice with metastatic breast tumors was prolonged after treatment. Furthermore, combination of herbal formula with chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin resulted in better anti-tumor efficacy and increased life span in tumor-bearing mice, when compared with doxorubicin alone treatment.", "In summary, our innovative Chinese herbal formula was demonstrated to possess anti-tumor, anti-metastatic and bone-protective activities in metastatic breast tumor-bearing mice. The preclinical data generated in this study would lead to the development of evidence-based supplement as adjuvant therapy for metastatic breast cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine, E205, Science Centre East Block, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Research On Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Yue", "ForeName": "Grace Gar-Lee", "Initials": "GG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine, E205, Science Centre East Block, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Research On Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Julia Kin-Ming", "Initials": "JK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine, E205, Science Centre East Block, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Research On Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Ben Chung-Lap", "Initials": "BC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine, E205, Science Centre East Block, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Research On Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Kwok", "ForeName": "Hin-Fai", "Initials": "HF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine, E205, Science Centre East Block, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Research On Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Hoi", "ForeName": "Sandy Wan-Heng", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["0000 0004 1764 6123", "grid.16890.36"], "Affiliation": "4Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Sze", "ForeName": "Daniel Man-Yuen", "Initials": "DM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine, E205, Science Centre East Block, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Research On Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Fung", "ForeName": "Kwok-Pui", "Initials": "KP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine, E205, Science Centre East Block, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Research On Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Leung", "ForeName": "Ping-Chung", "Initials": "PC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7409-1270"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine, E205, Science Centre East Block, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Research On Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Lau", "ForeName": "Clara Bik-San", "Initials": "CB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101265109", "ISSNLinking": "1749-8546"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Lambert AW, Pattabiraman DR, Weinberg RA.
