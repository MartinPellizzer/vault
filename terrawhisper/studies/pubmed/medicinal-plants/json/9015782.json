Recently, an epidemiological and CAP-inhibition study has shown a new clustering of allergy between melon and Plantago and grass pollens. The aim of the present study was to confirm these results by immunoblotting analysis and inhibition of immunoblotting. Sera from 3 patients with confirmed allergy to melon, and Dactylis glomerata and Plantago lanceolata pollens were used for the in vitro studies. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis with a pool of sera revealed that several distinct protein bands were shared by the three extracts at 14, 31, and a spectrum between 40 and 70 kDa, approximately. Immunoblotting inhibition experiments, performed with extracts of melon, Plantago and Dactylis, showed that all allergens of melon blotting were almost completely inhibited by grass and Plantago pollen extracts. Inversely, the melon extract was capable of inhibiting IgE-binding to various allergens of Dactylis at high mol mass and partially to the band at 14 kDa. Moreover, the melon almost totally inhibited the IgE-binding capacity to the proteins of Plantago extract. Taken together, the results support the presence of structurally similar allergens in melon, Plantago and grass pollens, and that all allergenic epitopes of the melon are present in these pollens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Servicio de Alergia y Asma, Hospital Los Montalvos, Salamanca, Spain."}], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda Ortiz", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ventas", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cosmes", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "L\u00f3pez-Asunsolo", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Spain", "MedlineTA": "J Investig Allergol Clin Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "9107858", "ISSNLinking": "1018-9068"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoblotting"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9015782"]}}]}
