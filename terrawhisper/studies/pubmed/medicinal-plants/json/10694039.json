The ascorbate-glutathione pathway is also involved in plant defence against oxidative stress. Therefore the effects of 2 metals (Cu, Zn) with different chemical behaviour were investigated on the enzymes of this pathway in the primary leaves of bean seedlings grown on hydroponics and supplied with a 50 microM concentration of both metals. The results obtained demonstrate that the capacities of the enzymes involved in the ascorbate-glutathione pathway increase after metal application, indicating that they induce oxidative stress indeed. However striking differences in the relative induction time of these enzymes suggest that the chemical behaviour of the metals applied, plays an important role in the induction of oxidative stress as well as in the defence mechanism against it."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Biology, Centre for Environmental Sciences, Limburgs Universitair Centrum, Diepenbeek, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cuypers", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vangronsveld", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clijsters", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9423872", "ISSNLinking": "1029-2470"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J41CSQ7QDS", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Zinc"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10694039", "10.1080/10715769900301301"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
