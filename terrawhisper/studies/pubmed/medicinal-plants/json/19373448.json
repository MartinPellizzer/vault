A. Meyer) is one of the most famous oriental medicinal plants used as crude drugs in Asian countries, and now it is being used worldwide for preventive and therapeutic purposes. Among diverse constituents of ginseng, saponins (ginsenosides) have been found to be major components responsible for their biological and pharmacological actions. On the other hand, difficulties in the supply of pure ginsenosides in quantity prevent the development of ginseng for clinical medicines. Cultivation of ginseng in fields takes a long time, generally 5-7 years, and needs extensive effort regarding quality control since growth is susceptible to many environmental factors including soil, shade, climate, pathogens and pests. To solve the problems, cell and tissue cultures have been widely explored for more rapid and efficient production of ginseng biomass and ginsenosides. Recently, cell and adventitious root cultures of P. ginseng have been established in large scale bioreactors with a view to commercial application. Various physiological and engineering parameters affecting the biomass production and ginsenoside accumulation have been investigated. Advances in adventitious root cultures including factors for process scale-up are reviewed in this chapter. In addition, biosafety analyses of ginseng adventitious roots are also discussed for real application."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for the Development of Advanced Horticultural Technology, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, 361-763, Republic of Korea, paekky@cbnu.ac.kr."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paek", "ForeName": "Kee-Yoeup", "Initials": "KY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murthy", "ForeName": "Hosakatte Niranjana", "Initials": "HN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hahn", "ForeName": "Eun-Joo", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Jian-Jiang", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Adv Biochem Eng Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8307733", "ISSNLinking": "0724-6145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxylipins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6U1S09C61L", "NameOfSubstance": "indoleacetic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "900N171A0F", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl jasmonate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxylipins"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Republic of Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19373448", "10.1007/10_2008_31"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
