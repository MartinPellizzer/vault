By using Maxent Model and ArcGIS, along with ecological factor data, the national habitat suitability distribution of Isatidis Radix was predicted. R-language was adopted to establish a model of the relationship between the medicinal component contents and ecological factors. The medicinal quality was divided by ArcGIS grid computing. The results indicated that the three main ecological factors affecting the distribution of Isatidis Radix were precipitation in the driest season, mean annual temperature and mean temperature in the wet season. The suitable cultivation region of Isatidis Radix is mainly distributed in the north of China, but the medicinal quality is quite different, Isatidis Radix in Xinjiang province has higher medicinal quality. This study provides a reference for rational selection of planting areas of Isatidis Radix."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Chinese (Tibetan) Medicinal Resources, Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Wen-Long", "Initials": "WL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Chinese (Tibetan) Medicinal Resources, Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hui-Zhen", "Initials": "HZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Zhi-Jia", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Chinese (Tibetan) Medicinal Resources, Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "You-Yuan", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Brassicaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Dispersal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29318844", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0193"]}}]}
