The rate of chromosome aberrations and their types were studied in anaphase and metaphase. Under normal conditions, chromosome breaks were only found to occur. Breakage of chromosomes occurs during interphase, and as a result, acentric fragments are located outside the equatorial plate during metaphase. This process of chromosome breakage leads to elimination of some genetic material, without concomitant exchanges, and therefore, it has been named \"elimination\" process. Spontaneous chromosome mutagenesis manifesting itself at cytogenetic level was concluded to be an elimination process directed to elimination of a portion of chromatin from chromosomes. When the conditions of spontaneous mutagenesis are altered, in particular, by cardiovascular diseases in man, by partial inhibition of DNA repair in mice and pea cells, by transformation of Chinese hamster cells, upon ageing of pea seeds-qualitative changes in the chromosomal aberrations are registered, connected with the appearance of chromosome exchanges and acentric fragments situated within the equatorial plate during metaphase. These two types of chromosome aberrations are proposed to be considered as new criteria of pathology. A system of processes was suggested to exist, preventing the appearance of aberrations during mitosis, and it is supposed to be one of the most significant homeostatic systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lebedeva", "ForeName": "L I", "Initials": "LI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Iakovchenko", "ForeName": "N N", "Initials": "NN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Vozmozhnye mekhanizmy vozniknoveniia perestroek khromosom.
