Schott, known as Alocasia is found in the Araceae, and is widely planted in southern China for its ornamental and medicinal value. This plant has a wide range of pharmacological effects, and has potential anti-tumor activity (Lei et al. 2013). In July of 2019, leaf spots were observed on A. macrorrhiza in the Xixiangtang Area, Nanning, Guangxi, China. Disease symptoms began with water-soaked yellow-green spots and progressed to form brown, round or oval lesions with yellow halos. Under severe conditions, spots merged into larger irregular lesions. More than 60% of the plants in a 0.5 ha field showed disease symptoms. Symptomatic leaves were collected and cut into small pieces (3\u00d73 mm). Leaf pieces from the margin of the necrotic tissue were surface sterilized in 75% alcohol for 10 s, followed by 2% sodium hypochlorite solution for 2 min, then rinsed three times in sterile distilled water. Tissues were plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 28\u00b0C for 5 days in the dark. Among over 30 isolates, most shared a similar morphology, the isolation rate of these was 86.7% and three of these (GY1-1A, GY1-1B, and GY1-1C) were chosen for single-spore purification and used for fungal morphological characterization and identification. White feathery aerial mycelia with olivaceous gray mycelia below were observed in 7-day cultures. After 14 days, orange conidia were observed. Conidia were hyaline, guttulate, smooth, one-celled, and cylindrical, averaged 13.79 \u03bcm \u00d7 5.26 \u03bcm, 13.89 \u03bcm \u00d7 5.33 \u03bcm and 13.92 \u03bcm \u00d7 5.42 \u03bcm for GY1-1A, GY1-1B and GY1-1C, respectively. Appressoria were mostly irregular in outline, deeply lobed or lightly lobed, gray brown to dark brown, conidial appressoria were 7.93 to 8.74 \u03bcm \u00d7 5.26 to 5.42 \u03bcm, mycelial appressoria were 7.15 to 10.11 \u03bcm \u00d7 5.60 to 7.44 \u03bcm. These morphological characteristics were similar to the C. siamense as previously described (Weir et al. 2012). The partial internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, actin (ACT), chitin synthase (CHS-1), glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), calmodulin (CAL), \u03b2-tubulin (TUB2), and the intergenic region of apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT) were amplified from genomic DNA for the three isolates using primers ITS4/ITS1 (White et al. 1990), ACT-512F/ACT-783R, CHS-79F/CHS-354R, GDF1/GDR1, CL1C/CL2C, Bt2a/Bt2b (Weir et al. 2012), and AM-F/AM-R (Silva et al. 2012) and sequenced. All sequences showed over 99% identity with C. siamense and were deposited in GenBank (ITS, MW040179-MW040181; ACT, MW049220-MW049222; CHS-1, MW049229-MW049231; GAPDH, MW049232-MW049234; CAL, MW049226-MW049228; TUB, MW049235-MW049237; ApMAT, MW049223-MW049225). Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA 5 using the concatenation of multiple sequences (ACT, CHS-1, GAPDH, ITS, TUB2, CAL). According to the phylogenetic tree, all three isolates were found with C. siamense with 95% bootstrap support. To confirm pathogenicity, three sets (three plants per set) of healthy leaves were slightly scratched with autoclaved toothpicks at each of eight locations. Each inoculation location was a cross (2 mm length) and inoculation location was at least 3 cm apart. Ten \u03bcl of conidial suspension (106 conidia /ml in 0.1% sterile Tween 20) was applied to the inoculation areas. A control group was mock inoculated with 0.1% sterile Tween 20. Plants were covered with plastic bags to maintain a high humidity environment and placed in a 28\u00b0C growth chamber with constant light for 7 days. Inoculated leaves showed yellowish brown spots (0.4 \u00d7 0.65 cm), but no symptoms were observed in the control group. The fungus was reisolated from inoculated leaves, and these isolates matched the molecular and morphological characteristics of the original isolates confirming Koch's postulates. Reported hosts of this pathogen include Coffea arabica, Carica papaya, Melilotus indicus and Litchi chinensis (Weir et al. 2012; Qin et al. 2017; Ling et al. 2019) and so on. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. siamense causing leaf spot on A. macrorrhiza in China. The identification of this pathogen provides a foundation for the management of leaf spot on this medicinal plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yangtze University, 47897, College of Life Sciences, Jingzhou County Jingmi Road, Jingzhou, Hubei , China, 434025; 1930745671@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yangtze University, 47897, College of life Sciences, Jingzhou, Hubei , China; 75102310@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Wenxiu", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yangtze University, 47897, College of life sciences, Jingzhou, Hubei , China; 496233825@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Science and Guangxi Key Laboratory of Biology for Crop Diseases and Insect Pests, Nanning, Guangxi, Nanning, Guangxi, China; 875919451@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Chunxiang", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi University, College of Agriculture, 100 daxue road, Nanning, Guangxi Province, Nanning, China, 530004; 361566787@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "SuiPing", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of plant protection, 174, daxuedong road, nanning, Guangxi, Nanning, Guangxi, China, X2ogGBuM."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Biology for Crop Diseases and Insect Pests, Nanning, Guangxi, China; 654123597@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Lihua", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of plant protection, 174 daxue road, Nanning, Guangxi Province, Nanning, Guangxi, China, 530007; 65615384@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qili", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of plant protection, Nanning, Guangxi, China; guotangxun@gxaas.net."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Tangxun", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of plant protection, Nanning, Guangxi, China; mojianyou@gxaas.net."}], "LastName": "Mo", "ForeName": "Jianyou", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Agricultural Vocation-Technical College, Department of Biotechnology, Nanning, Guangxi, China; 382279601@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Ning", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "18"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["33434032", "10.1094/PDIS-11-20-2361-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
