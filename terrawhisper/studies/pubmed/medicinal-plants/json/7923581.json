Cancer, 17, 279-286, 1992). A new crop of high-selenium garlic was harvested in 1992 and was used in a dose-response study to confirm the reproducibility of the product and the bioassay. Supplementation of 1 or 2 p.p.m. Se in the diet from the high-selenium garlic produced a 56% or 75% reduction respectively in the total tumor yield. Since both garlic and onion belong to the same allium family of vegetables, we were also interested in finding out whether our experience with garlic could be similarly applied to onion. A high-selenium onion crop was grown in the same season and location and with the same schedule of selenium fertilization. Two distinct differences were noted with the high-selenium onion regarding its capacity to accumulate selenium and its efficacy in cancer prevention. First, the selenium concentration in onion was considerably lower (28 p.p.m. Se dry wt) as compared to that found in garlic (110-150 p.p.m. Se). Second, given the same levels of selenium supplementation, the high-selenium onion was apparently not as powerful as the high-selenium garlic in mammary cancer inhibition. Thus different plants, even those of the same genus, may respond in their unique way to selenium fertilization and the biological benefits of selenium enrichment may vary depending on the species. Additional information from our study indicated that the high-selenium garlic/onion might provide an ideal system for delivering selenium-substituted analogs in a food form for cancer prevention: (i) they expressed a good range of anticancer activity and could be easily adapted for human consumption on a regular basis; (ii) their ingestion did not result in an excessive accumulation of tissue selenium, a concern that is associated with the standard selenium compounds such as selenite and selenomethionine; (iii) no perturbation in the maintenance of functional selenoenzymes were observed even at high levels of supplementation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgical Oncology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263."}], "LastName": "Ip", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lisk", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA 27706", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Carcinogenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8008055", "ISSNLinking": "0143-3334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.8", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodide Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H6241UJ22B", "NameOfSubstance": "Selenium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feasibility Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Iodide Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Selenium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7923581", "10.1093/carcin/15.9.1881"]}}]}
