Therefore, in the present investigation, the bioactive compounds (polyphenols and flavonoids) and the radical scavenging capacities of Prolipid, a mixture of herbs, were studied. Water extracts showed relatively high capacity of about 61.5% inhibition with the beta-carotene linoleic acid assay. In order to support the data obtained with beta-carotene-linoleic acid assay, three different antioxidant assays were used: ferric-reducing/antioxidant power, trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical with prolonged time of their reactions. It was found that the amounts of polyphenols in water and methanol extracts were 22.849+/-2.267 and 3.241+/-0.325 mg gallic acid equivalent/g dry weight, and the antioxidant capacities in same extracts as determined by the 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) test after 120 min were 275.81+/-27.58 and 62.25+/-6.11 micromole Trolox equivalents (microMTE) g dry weight, respectively. The correlation coefficients between polyphenols and antioxidant capacities of Prolipid with 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical and beta-carotene linoleic acid assay were about 0.97 and 0.98. In conclusion, the bioactivity of Prolipid was high and the total polyphenols were the main contributors to the overall antioxidant capacity. The results of our investigation in vitro are comparable with other medicinal plants and fruits widely used in the treatment of humans without known side effects. Prolipid, a mixture of herbs, can therefore be used as a supplement for nutritional and healthy purposes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, National Institute of Public Health, Warsaw, Poland. zenon@il.waw.pl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jastrzebski", "ForeName": "Zenon", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Medina", "ForeName": "Oscar J", "Initials": "OJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moreno", "ForeName": "L Marlen", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gorinstein", "ForeName": "Shela", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "9432922", "ISSNLinking": "0963-7486"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Statistics as Topic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17852501", "10.1080/09637480701335941", "779356835"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
