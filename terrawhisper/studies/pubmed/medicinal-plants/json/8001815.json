Despite its importance as a crop pest, there is little understanding of the genetic structure of its populations or the extent of genetic divergence associated with different host plant utilization. This study examined the extent of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity among 35 clones of pea aphids from alfalfa. Polymorphisms were detected at only 2 of 126 restriction sites, suggesting the same impoverished level of genetic diversity found in prior allozyme studies. However, length variation was common and apparently arose as a result of tandem repeats in two regions of the mtDNA molecule. Region 1 occurred in proximity to the control region of the molecule, while region 2 was close to a cluster of tRNA genes flanking the NAD-dehydrogenase subunit 3 gene on the opposite side of the mtDNA molecule. Each of the aphid clones was homoplasmic for a single length variant in region 1, which varied with respect to the number of copies of a 120-bp repeat. By contrast, one-third of the clones were heteroplasmic at region 2, where they possessed a variable number of copies of a 210-bp repeat. Reanalysis of clones after 30 generations of parthenogenetic reproduction established the stability of length variants over this interval, suggesting their value in studies of the genetic structure of aphid populations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, University of Guelph, ON, Canada."}], "LastName": "Barrett", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Crease", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hebert", "ForeName": "P D", "Initials": "PD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Via", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Genome", "NlmUniqueID": "8704544", "ISSNLinking": "0831-2796"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Primers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Mitochondrial"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Aphids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clone Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Primers"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Mitochondrial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Insect"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicago sativa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Restriction Mapping"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8001815", "10.1139/g94-121"]}}]}
