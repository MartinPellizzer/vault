Heat treatment caused complete inactivation of trypsin inhibitors whereas it did not affect phytic acid levels. Proximate components, minerals, and amino acids did not change, but low molecular weight sugars were affected by heat treatment differently for each germinated legume. The sugar digestibility ratio (total digestible sugars/total nondigestible sugars) in germinated black beans doubled after heat treatment. True protein digestibility (TD) increased with heat treatment only in germinated soybean. Net protein utilization was markedly improved (20%) with heat treatment in germinated soybean and lupin. Utilizable protein of heat-treated germinated legumes was 289, 236, and 132 g/kg of legume dry weight for soybean, lupin, and black bean, respectively. Supplementation with methionine did not alter TD but improved all other indices of protein utilization in the germinated legumes, particularly in black bean. All three germinated legumes become equivalent in protein quality when heating and supplementation with methionine are combined with germination. The use of germinated heat-treated soybean, lupin, and black bean on their own and/or as food ingredients is nutritionally advantageous due to the low content of nondigestible oligosaccharides and the high protein utilization."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratorio de Bioquimica Nutricional e de Alimentos, Departamento de Bioquimica, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trugo", "ForeName": "L C", "Initials": "LC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Donangelo", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trugo", "ForeName": "N M", "Initials": "NM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bach Knudsen", "ForeName": "K E", "Initials": "KE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10888502", "10.1021/jf9913920", "jf9913920"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
