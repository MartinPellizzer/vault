Using plate-hole diffusion assays, the following results were obtained: (a) extract from the leaves of Eremophila alternifolia (Myoporaceae) showed activity against MRSA; (b) extract from the leaves of Acacia kempeana (Mimosaceae) showed incomplete inhibition of VRE; (c) extracts from the leaves of Amyema quandong (Loranthaceae) and Eremophila duttonii (Myoporaceae) were active against both types of bacteria; (d) extract from the stem base of Lepidosperma viscidum (Cyperaceae) was active against MRSA and exhibited incomplete inhibition of VRE. All active extracts were evaluated using time-kill assays. Most of the extracts showed bactericidal effects and reduced the number of viable cells by 4-6 logs within four hours, while the extracts from Acacia kempeana leaves and Lepidosperma viscidum stem base exhibited bacteriostatic activity against VRE. The extract from the leaves of Eremophila duttonii was the most active and reduced the number of viable cells of MRSA and VRE to undetectable levels within 1 hour."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment and Biotechnology Centre, School of Engineering and Science, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorne, Victoria, Australia. epalombo@swin.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Palombo", "ForeName": "Enzo A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Semple", "ForeName": "Susan J", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Basic Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8503885", "ISSNLinking": "0233-111X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Australia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enterococcus faecalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Positive Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methicillin Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vancomycin Resistance"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12442307", "10.1002/1521-4028(200212)42:6<444::AID-JOBM444>3.0.CO;2-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
