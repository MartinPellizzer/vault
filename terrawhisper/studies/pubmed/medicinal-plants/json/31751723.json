Our previous studies have demonstrated that N16 inhibited osteoclast differentiation in vitro. To better understand how N16 regulates osteoclast differentiation, RAW264.7 cells, a murine monocytic cell line and murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were adopted. Treatment of RAW264.7 cells with RANKL activated osteoclastogenesis and N16 inhibited the formation of multinucleated osteoclasts and TRAP activity. The suppression occurred at the early stage of osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, we found that N16 inhibited PU.1 and MITF expressions, mirroring the inhibition of RANK expressions, indicating that N16 inhibited RANK expression by down-regulating the expressions of MITF and PU.1, thus preventing osteoclastogenesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
