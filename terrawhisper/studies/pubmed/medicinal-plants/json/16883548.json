A total of 54 compounds released from all of these varieties of Angelica rhizomes were separated and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The composition of supercritical extracts from these plants was very different from the solid-phase microextraction products. More compounds were detected by SPME-GC-MS (41) than by SFE-GC-MS (17). The results of these analyses suggest that SFE may be useful for detecting the main components, decursinol angelate and decursin in Korean danggui, and butylidene dihydro-phthalide in both Chinese and Japanese danggui, whereas the results for SPME did not. The SFE method required specialized instrumentation, required little time to prepare the sample, and had a small sample size and no organic solvent. In sum, these results suggest that SFE is useful for extracting the volatile main components of danggui cultivars. Its simplicity, low cost and speed may allow SPME to increase the recovery of volatile components in general without disturbing the main components of the plant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products Chemistry Laboratory, Institute of Agricultural Science and Technology, Chonnam National University, 300 Yong-Bong Dong, Buk-Ku, Gwangju 500-757, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Mi Ra", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abd El-Aty", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Jeong-Heui", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Kang Bong", "Initials": "KB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shim", "ForeName": "Jae Han", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Angelica"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Supercritical Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Solid Phase Microextraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16883548", "10.1002/bmc.696"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
