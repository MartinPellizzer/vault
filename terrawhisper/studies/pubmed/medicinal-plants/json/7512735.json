On the other hand, spinach and pea chloroplast FBPases showed strong cross-reactions against the antisera to chloroplast FBPases, in the same way that the pea and spinach cytosolic enzymes displayed good cross-reactions against the antiserum to spinach cytosolic FBPase. Crude extracts from spinach and pea leaves, as well as the corresponding purified chloroplast enzymes, showed by western blotting only one band (44 and 43 kD, respectively) in reaction with either of the antisera against the chloroplast enzymes. A unique fraction of molecular mass 38 kD appeared when either of the crude extracts or the purified spinach cytosolic FBPase were analyzed against the spinach cytosolic FBPase antiserum. These molecular sizes are in accordance with those reported for the subunits of the photosynthetic and gluconeogenic FBPases. Chloroplast and cytosolic FBPases underwent increasing inactivation when increasing concentrations of chloroplast or cytosolic anti-FBPase immunoglobulin G (IgG), respectively, were added to the reaction mixture. However, inactivations were not observed when the photosynthetic enzyme was incubated with the IgG to cytosolic FBPase, or vice versa. Quantitative results obtained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) showed 77% common antigenic determinants between the two chloroplast enzymes when tested against the spinach photosynthetic FBPase antiserum, which shifted to 64% when assayed against the pea antiserum. In contrast, common antigenic determinats between the spinach cytosolic FBPase and the two chloroplast enzymes were less than 10% when the ELISA test was carried out with either of the photosynthetic FBPase antisera, and only 5% when the assay was performed with the antiserum to the spinach cytosolic FBPase. These results were supported by sequencing data: the deduced amino acid sequence of a chloroplast FBPase clone isolated from a pea cDNA library indicated a 39,253 molecular weight protein, with a homology of 85% with the spinach chloroplast FBPase but only 48.5% with the cytosolic enzyme from spinach."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biochemistry, Estaci\u00f3n Experimental del Zaid\u00edn, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, Granada, Spain."}], "LastName": "Fonoll\u00e1", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hermoso", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Carrasco", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chueca", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "L\u00e1zaro", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Prado", "ForeName": "F E", "Initials": "FE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "L\u00f3pez-Gorg\u00e9", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Epitopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.11", "NameOfSubstance": "Fructose-Bisphosphatase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytosol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Epitopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fructose-Bisphosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1990 Jun;93(2):374-83", "ArticleIdList": ["16667476"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 1970 Aug 15;227(5259):680-5", "ArticleIdList": ["5432063"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1991 Aug;96(4):1026-33", "ArticleIdList": ["16668293"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1978 Sep 10;253(17):5952-6", "ArticleIdList": ["210163"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1990 May;93(1):40-7", "ArticleIdList": ["16667463"]}, {"Citation": "Nucleic Acids Res. 1989 Aug 25;17(16):6569-80", "ArticleIdList": ["2780287"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1984 Feb;74(2):340-7", "ArticleIdList": ["16663420"]}, {"Citation": "Eur J Biochem. 1990 Apr 20;189(1):89-94", "ArticleIdList": ["2158892"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Mol Biol. 1992 Feb;18(4):799-802", "ArticleIdList": ["1313712"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1989 Dec;91(4):1393-401", "ArticleIdList": ["16667191"]}, {"Citation": "Nucleic Acids Res. 1988 Aug 25;16(16):7931-42", "ArticleIdList": ["2843806"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7512735", "PMC159209", "10.1104/pp.104.2.381", "104/2/381"]}}]}
