Natural products are an important source of antithrombogenic agents and have been considered remarkable alternatives with greater efficacy and usually with fewer side effects. However, the efficacy and toxicity of many of these plants that are used in traditional medicine must be scientifically tested. Despite a large number of published articles that report that plants or plant-derived components may act as antithrombogenic agents, few studies have investigated the mechanism of action of medicinal plants. This review presents the current knowledge about the major cellular and molecular mechanisms of antithrombogenic plants and their main components. Many well-established mechanisms (e.g., platelet aggregation, coagulation factors, and thrombolysis) are related to the antithrombogenic activity of many natural products. However, the central pathways that are responsible for their activity remain unclear. Further studies are needed to clarify the central role of each of these pathways in the pleiotropic response to these agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Preclinical Research of Natural Products, Graduate Program in Animal Science with Emphasis on Bioactive Products, Paranaense University, Umuarama, PR, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Mendes", "ForeName": "Tatiane C", "Initials": "TC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Preclinical Research of Natural Products, Graduate Program in Animal Science with Emphasis on Bioactive Products, Paranaense University, Umuarama, PR, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Dos Reis L\u00edvero", "ForeName": "Francislaine Aparecida", "Initials": "FA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nucleus of Chemical- Pharmaceutical Investigations (NIQFAR), University of Vale do Itaja\u00ed, Itaja\u00ed, SC, Brazil."}], "LastName": "de Souza", "ForeName": "Priscila", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Electrophysiology and Cardiovascular Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Federal University of Grande Dourados, Dourados, MS, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Gebara", "ForeName": "Karimi S", "Initials": "KS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Electrophysiology and Cardiovascular Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Federal University of Grande Dourados, Dourados, MS, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Junior", "ForeName": "Arquimedes Gasparotto", "Initials": "AG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fibrinolytic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fibrinolytic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Function Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31840604", "10.2174/1381612825666191216125135", "CPD-EPUB-103005"]}}]}
