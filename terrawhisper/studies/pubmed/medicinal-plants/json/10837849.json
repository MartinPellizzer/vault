The HPE employed was a dry extract containing 0.3% hypericin and 3.8% hyperforin. Intraperitoneal pretreatment with 20 mg/kg of the sigma receptor antagonist rimcazole (RIM), 30 min prior to HPE, completely suppressed the antiimmobility effect of HPE (3 intragastric injections of 250 mg/kg). Intracerebroventricular pretreatment with 5, 7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), which produced a marked depletion of brain serotonin, reduced the antiimmobility effect, although this reduction was not as pronounced as that of RIM. On the other hand, the inhibitory effect of HPE on 10% ethanol intake was modified neither by 5,7-DHT nor by RIM pretreatment. These results suggest that the antidepressant-like effect of HPE in the FST may be mediated by interaction with sigma receptors and to some extent by increased serotonergic neurotransmission. On the other hand, these mechanisms appear to be unimportant for the effect of HPE on ethanol intake."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Military Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, 01-163, Kozielska 4, Warsaw, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Panocka", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Perfumi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Angeletti", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ciccocioppo", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Massi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacol Biochem Behav", "NlmUniqueID": "0367050", "ISSNLinking": "0091-3057"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, sigma"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31363-74-3", "NameOfSubstance": "5,7-Dihydroxytryptamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "C3N1PS8CX1", "NameOfSubstance": "rimcazole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "5,7-Dihydroxytryptamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbazoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, sigma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swimming"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10837849", "10.1016/s0091-3057(00)00193-3", "S0091-3057(00)00193-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
