Such effect of garlic was not shown in the 1.7% garlic treated group and most remarkable in the 6.7% garlic treated group. The protective effect of garlic was superior to those of 2,3 dimercapto-1-propanol (BAL) and D-penicillamine (PEN), and nearly similar to those of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (APEN), the current remedies, while garlic was not effective as a curative agent for heavy metal poisoning. The excretion of cadmium was enhanced, more through feces than urine by garlic but the effect to the urinary excretion of cadmium was not significant comparing with DMSA or APEN when cadmium was ip injected in the first 3 days during the 12 days of oral administration of DMSA, APEN or garlic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul."}], "LastName": "Cha", "ForeName": "C W", "Initials": "CW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "J Korean Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8703518", "ISSNLinking": "1011-8934"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FXS1BY2PGL", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercury"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mercury"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Mercury Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3268178", "PMC3053644", "10.3346/jkms.1987.2.4.213"]}}]}
