Alkaloids present in belladonna have anti-inflammatory, anticholinergic, antispasmodic, mydriatic, analgesic, anticonvulsant, and antimicrobial activities, which makes it widely applicable for the treatment of various diseases. However, because of its associated toxicity, the medicinal use of belladonna is debatable. Therefore, an evidence-based systematic review was planned to elucidate the pharmacotherapeutic potential of belladonna. A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, MEDLINE, the Cochrane database, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov using the keywords \"belladonna\", \"belladonna and clinical trials\", and \"safety and efficacy of belladonna\". Articles published from 1965 to 2020 showing the efficacy of belladonna in diverse clinical conditions are included. The quality of evidence was generated using the GRADE approach, and 20 studies involving 2302 patients were included for the systematic review. Our analyses suggest that belladonna treatment appears to be safe and effective in various disease conditions, including acute encephalitis syndrome, urethral stent pain, myocardial ischemia injury, airway obstructions during sleep in infants, climacteric complaints, irritable bowel syndrome, and throbbing headache. However, better understanding of the dosage and the toxicity of tropane alkaloids of belladonna could make it an efficient remedy for treating diverse medical conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Advanced Research, Faculty of Medicine, King George's Medical University, Lucknow 226003, India."}], "LastName": "Maurya", "ForeName": "Vimal K", "Initials": "VK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Advanced Research, Faculty of Medicine, King George's Medical University, Lucknow 226003, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Swatantra", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Allied Health, Faculty of Health, Education, Medicine, and Social Care, Anglia Ruskin University, Chelmsford CM1 1SQ, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Kabir", "ForeName": "Russell", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland 20852, United States."}], "LastName": "Shrivastava", "ForeName": "Gaurav", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Shanker", "ForeName": "Karuna", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CCRH, Ministry of Ayush, Government of India, New Delhi 110058, India."}], "LastName": "Nayak", "ForeName": "Debadatta", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CCRH, Ministry of Ayush, Government of India, New Delhi 110058, India."}], "LastName": "Khurana", "ForeName": "Anil", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CCRH, Ministry of Ayush, Government of India, New Delhi 110058, India."}], "LastName": "Manchanda", "ForeName": "Raj K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, JSPS Government Medical College, Hyderabad 500013, India."}], "LastName": "Gadugu", "ForeName": "Srinivasulu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, King George's Medical University, Lucknow 226003, India."}], "LastName": "Kar", "ForeName": "Sujita K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow 226003, India."}], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Anoop K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2856-4185"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Advanced Research, Faculty of Medicine, King George's Medical University, Lucknow 226003, India."}], "LastName": "Saxena", "ForeName": "Shailendra K", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Chem Neurosci", "NlmUniqueID": "101525337", "ISSNLinking": "1948-7193"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32662978", "10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00413"]}}]}
