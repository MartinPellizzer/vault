Different pharmacological effects have been described for the plant including; bronchodilation, vasodilation, and effect on lung inflammation. The plant is also used as a remedy against cough in the traditional medicine. In this article, 'pharmacological effects of Z.\u00a0multiflora and its constituents focusing on their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties were reviewed' by searching various databases until 'June' 2016. The anti-inflammatory effects of the plant such as decreased total white blood cell, neutrophils, and eosinophils counts were demonstrated. The sprotective effects of Z.\u00a0multiflora on serum levels of phospholipase A2 and total protein were showed. In addition, constituents of the plant, such as flavonoids and carvacrol, also showed anti-inflammatory effects. Z.\u00a0multiflora also reduced oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals and can be used in the therapy of oxidative damage. Decreased level of malondialdehyde and protective effects of Z.\u00a0multiflora on serum levels of nitric oxide were also shown. Improvement of the serum levels of IgE, reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-4, TGF-\u03b2, and IL-17), and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 and FOXP3) were shown for Z.\u00a0multiflora and its constituents, carvacrol and thymol. These results indicated that carvacrol and thymol could be used for treatment of inflammatory diseases as new anti-inflammatory agents. Therefore, Z.\u00a0multiflora showed anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory effects which could be used for treatment of inflammatory and immune dysregulation diseases or disorders associated with increased oxidative stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Pharmacologie et de Th\u00e9rapeutique."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Pharmaceutical Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khazdair", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Pharmaceutical Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorani", "ForeName": "Vahideh", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Neurogenic Inflammation Research Centre, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alavinezhad", "ForeName": "Azam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5736-9755"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Neurogenic Inflammation Research Centre, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Boskabady", "ForeName": "Mohammad Hossein", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Fundam Clin Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "8710411", "ISSNLinking": "0767-3981"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Immune System"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29125648", "10.1111/fcp.12331"]}}]}
