IgE binding of these 2 sera to agarose-bound paprika pollen extract could be inhibited by paprika pollen but not by tomato pollen extract. A greenhouse worker, who cultivated tomato plants, had IgE against both tomato and paprika pollen. IgE binding of this serum to agarose-bound paprika pollen extract could be inhibited by both paprika pollen and tomato pollen extract. Three food-allergic patients also had IgE against tomato and paprika pollen. IgE from 2 food-allergic patients recognized IgE-binding structures in paprika or tomato pollen that were also present in fruit from the corresponding plant. In contrast, no substantial cross-reactivity was observed between paprika pollen and fruit towards IgE from 3 greenhouse workers. In 4 of 5 sera that were positive in the paprika pollen immunoblot major IgE binding to allergens of about 30 and 64 kD occurred.", "The presence of IgE against paprika or tomato pollen is not restricted to workers in horticulture; IgE against these pollen can also be present in food-allergic patients who have serum IgE against paprika and/or tomato fruit."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2000 S.
