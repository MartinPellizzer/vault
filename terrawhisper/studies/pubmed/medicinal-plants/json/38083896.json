Therefore, it is important to investigate various alternative therapeutic assistance, such as natural remedies derived from medicinal plants. In this context, chicoric acid, classified as a hydroxycinnamic acid, has been documented to exhibit a range of health advantages. These include antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, obesity-preventing, and neuroprotective effects. Due to its considerable pharmacological properties, chicoric acid has found extensive applications in food, pharmaceuticals, animal husbandry, and various other commercial sectors. This article provides a comprehensive overview of in vitro and in vivo investigations on chicoric acid, highlighting its beneficial effects and therapeutic activity when used as a preventative and management aid for public health conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hepatic illnesses like non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Moreover, further investigation of this compound can lead to its development as a potential phytopharmaceutical candidate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0110-9238"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, GLA University, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Goyal", "ForeName": "Ahsas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3758-177X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, GLA University, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Dubey", "ForeName": "Nandini", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, GLA University, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "Anant", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, GLA University, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Rashmi", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4250-2282"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, GLA University, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Aanchal", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38083896", "10.2174/0113892010280616231127075921", "CPB-EPUB-136623"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
