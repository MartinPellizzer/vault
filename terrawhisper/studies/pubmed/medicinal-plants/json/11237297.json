Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations were established using two host plant species, maize (Zea mays L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and two AM fungi, Glomus mosseae and G. versiforme. When the standard and modified cultivation systems were compared, the new method yielded much more fungal tissue in the hyphal compartment. Using G. versiforme as the fungal symbiont, up to 30 mg of fungal dry matter (DM) was recovered from the hyphal compartment of mycorrhizal maize and about 6 mg from red clover. Multi-element analysis was conducted on samples of host plant roots and shoots and on harvested fungal biomass. Concentrations of P, Cu and Zn were much higher in the fungal biomass than in the roots or shoots of the host plants but fungal concentrations of K, Ca, Mg, Fe and Mn were similar to or lower than those in the plants. There were also significant differences in nutrient concentrations between the two AM fungi and these may be related to differences in their proportions of extraradical mycelium to spores. The high affinity of the fungal mycelium for Zn was very striking and is discussed in relation to the potential use of arbuscular mycorrhiza in the phytoremediation of Zn-polluted soils."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agricultural Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Christie", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glass"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microspheres"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mycology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11237297", "10.1016/s0045-6535(00)00124-7", "S0045-6535(00)00124-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
