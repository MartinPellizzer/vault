Some of the extracts were prepared from air-dried and ground plant material which was exhaustively extracted with successive solvents of different polarity: ethyl ether, ethyl alcohol and water. Other extracts were prepared either by distillation of the whole water extracts of 24 hours macerated plants or by water extraction from residues of plants remained after distillation. These plant extracts act as toxicants, growth and development and reproduction inhibitors and repellents. The differential responses induced by these plant extracts on assessed insects were influenced by several factors such as the plant species, the solvents used for extractions, the species and the stages of insect life and also the methods employed for evaluation. Some of the tested plants appear to have a great potential for providing safer insect control agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Entomology Laboratory, Cantacuzino Institute, Spl.
