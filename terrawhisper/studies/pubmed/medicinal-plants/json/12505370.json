The traditional herbal medicines and their preparations have been widely used in Korea as well as in China and Japan for thousands of years. One of the characteristics of Korean herbal medicine preparations is that all the herbal medicines are incorporated into an extractor at the same time and extracted with boiling water during the decoction process. In this process, a variety of interactions between the active components of several herbal medicines may occur. This is the main reason why quality control of oriental herbal drug is more difficult than that of western herbal drug. In this paper, we would like to present an overview of the characteristics of regulation and quality control of herbal medicines in Korea."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Herbal Medicines Evaluation, Korea Food and Drug Administration, Seoul 122-704, South Korea. cdwkje@hanmail.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Don Woong", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jong Hwan", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "So Yean", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Dal Hwan", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Seung Yeup", "Initials": "SY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Toxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "0361055", "ISSNLinking": "0300-483X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Legislation, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}], "NumberOfReferences": "9"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12505370", "10.1016/s0300-483x(02)00487-0", "S0300483X02004870"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
