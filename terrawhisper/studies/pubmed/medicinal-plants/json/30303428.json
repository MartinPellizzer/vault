This study sought to understand parents' roles in and perceptions of IPC between their child's healthcare professionals and educators. We recruited 23 mothers to participate in our study. Data were analyzed using a combination of univariate analyses and content analysis. Overall, parents reported that they could effectively communicate their child's health and educational needs with health and educational professionals, but statistical analysis determined moderately increased challenges presenting information across professions. Most participants (n\u00a0=\u00a019) indicated that IPC between health and educational professionals could be improved. Effectively engaging parents as partners in IPC can promote more seamless collaboration and communication of a child's needs and offer a greater likelihood of achieving a child's health and educational goals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1352-8501"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Faculty of Education , University of Ottawa , Ottawa , Canada."}], "LastName": "Giroux", "ForeName": "Catherine M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9910-3338"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b School of Epidemiology, Public Health, and Preventative Medicine , University of Ottawa , Canada."}], "LastName": "Wilson", "ForeName": "Lindsay A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Schulich School of Education , Nipissing University , North Bay , Canada."}], "LastName": "Corkett", "ForeName": "Julie K", "Initials": "JK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Interprof Care", "NlmUniqueID": "9205811", "ISSNLinking": "1356-1820"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Communication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Confidentiality"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["organization & administration"], "DescriptorName": "Health Education"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interdisciplinary Communication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Mothers"}, {"QualifierName": ["organization & administration"], "DescriptorName": "Patient Education as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Professional-Family Relations"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "School Teachers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Self Efficacy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30303428", "10.1080/13561820.2018.1531833"]}}]}
