Perilla extract significantly induced NO production from mesangial cells, which was enormously augmented without cytotoxity by combination with interferon (IFN)-gamma or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. On the other hand, perilla extract suppressed a large amount of NO production induced by IFN-gamma combined with lipopolysaccharide. Northern blot analysis revealed that such effects of perilla extract were dependent on inducible NO synthase mRNA expression. Perilla extract exhibited an inhibitory effect on cytokine-induced mesangial cell proliferation, and this effect was significantly decreased upon combination with N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), a non-specific NO synthase inhibitor, suggesting that perilla extract inhibits mesangial cell proliferation partially through the induction of NO production. Such results indicate that perilla may be a promising agent for the prevention of the progression of glomerulonephritis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Makino", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ono", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ito", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Muso", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Honda", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glomerular Mesangium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10375167", "10.1248/bpb.22.476"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
