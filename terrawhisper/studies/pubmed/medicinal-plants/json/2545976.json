On the other hand, the MeOH fraction was found to inhibit ACTH-induced lipolysis but not to inhibit adrenaline-induced lipolysis. The active substances isolated from this root were elucidated to be psoralen (I), bergapten (II), isopteryxin(3'-angeloyloxy-4'-acetoxy-3',4'-dihydroseseli n) (III) and 3'-epoxyangeloyloxy-4'-acetoxy-3',4'-dihydroseselin (IV), respectively. The two furocoumarins, psoralen and bergapten, were found to enhance ACTH- and adrenaline-induced lipolysis in fat cells respectively. In contrast, a coumarin derivative of khellactone type, isopteryxin (III), was found to inhibit the adrenaline-induced lipolysis but with no effect on ACTH-induced lipolysis and insulin-induced lipogenesis from glucose. The other coumarin of khellactone type, 3'(R), 4'(R)-3'-epoxyangeloyloxy-4'-acetoxy-3',4'-dihydroseseline (IV), was found to inhibit the insulin-induced lipogenesis from glucose but it had no effect on adrenaline- and ACTH-induced lipolysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Second Department of Medical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Ehime University, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kimura", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Okuda", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4FVK84C92X", "NameOfSubstance": "5-Methoxypsoralen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-60-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Adrenocorticotropic Hormone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KTZ7ZCN2EX", "NameOfSubstance": "Ficusin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U4VJ29L7BQ", "NameOfSubstance": "Methoxsalen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YKH834O4BH", "NameOfSubstance": "Epinephrine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "5-Methoxypsoralen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adipose Tissue"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adrenocorticotropic Hormone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Epinephrine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ficusin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Methoxsalen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2545976", "10.1016/0378-8741(89)90033-0", "0378-8741(89)90033-0"]}}]}
