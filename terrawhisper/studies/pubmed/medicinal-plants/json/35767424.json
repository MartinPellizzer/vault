The surface coating with various anti-fouling materials provides a solution to overcome it, but limited options in clinic and their potential immunogenicity drive the development of more alternative coating materials. Herein, inspired by liquid-liquid phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) to form separated condensates in physiological conditions, we develop a new type of low-fouling biomaterial based on flexible IDP of FUS protein containing rich hydrophilic residues. A chemical structure-defined FUS IDP sequence tagged with a tetra-cysteine motif (IDP<sub>FUS</sub>) was engineered and applied for covalent immobilization on various surfaces to form a uniform layer of protein tangles, which boosted strong hydration on surfaces, as revealed by molecular dynamics simulation. The IDP<sub>FUS</sub>-coated surfaces displayed excellent performance in resisting adsorption of various proteins and adhesion of different cells, platelets, and bacteria. Moreover, the IDP<sub>FUS</sub>-coated implants largely mitigated the host's FBR compared with bare implants and particularly outperformed PEG-coated implants in reducing collagen encapsulation. Thus, this novel low-fouling and anti-FBR strategy provides a potential surface coating material for biomedical implants, which will also shed light on exploring similar applications of other IDP proteins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Phosphorus Chemistry and Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Bioprocess, College of Life Science and Technology, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jia-Lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Phosphorus Chemistry and Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Guan-Yi", "Initials": "GY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Phosphorus Chemistry and Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Phosphorus Chemistry and Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Hua-Zhen", "Initials": "HZ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4880-5962"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Bioprocess, College of Life Science and Technology, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Shi-Zhong", "Initials": "SZ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3518-0139"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Phosphorus Chemistry and Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yong-Xiang", "Initials": "YX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Intrinsically Disordered Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Biofouling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Foreign Bodies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intrinsically Disordered Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35767424", "10.1021/jacs.2c02677"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
