The histopathological observation and the determination of biochemical indexes evaluate the therapeutic effect of the Jigucao capsule, and the metabolomic method analyzes the mechanism of the Jigucao capsule against Yanghuang syndrome. Jigucao capsule reduces the number of inflammatory cells, inhibits the proliferation of bile duct epithelial cells and hepatocyte necrosis. Compared with Yanghuang syndrome rats, the levels of alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bile acid were significantly reduced (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Furthermore, Jigucao capsule significantly reversed the abnormal levels of glucose 1-phosphate, phenylalanyl-cysteine, taurodeoxycholic acid, lysoPC (22:6 (4Z, 7Z, 10Z, 13Z, 16Z, 19Z), lysoPC (15:0), lysoPC (P-18:0), 7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoate and 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatrieic acid and regulated part of the lipid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism, Jigucao capsule has a therapeutic effect on Yanghuang syndrome rats. In short, this study sets for the first time elaborated on the underlying mechanism of Jigucao capsule resistance to Yanghuang syndrome rats from a metabolomics perspective, providing the basic data for the pharmacodynamic studies of the Jigucao capsule."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
