However, the antidiabetic potential and underlying molecular mechanism of these components are not fully elucidated. Herein, we studied the anti-diabetic effects of jambone E (JE), a phenolipid from S. cumini, with in vitro and in vivo models. Data from current study showed that JE enhanced glucose consumption and uptake, promoted glycogen synthesis, and suppressed gluconeogenesis in insulin resistant (IR)-HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes. JE also attenuated streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in type 1 diabetic (T1D) mice. Eleven metabolites (e.g. trimethylamine n-oxide, 4-pyridoxic acid, phosphatidylinositol 39:4, phenaceturic acid, and hippuric acid) were identified as potential serum biomarkers for JE's antidiabetic effects by an untargeted metabolomics approach. The further molecular mechanistic study revealed that JE up-regulated phosphorylation levels of protein kinase B (AKT), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, and forkhead box O1 (FoxO1), promoted nuclear exclusion of FoxO1 whilst decreased gene expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1\u00a0alpha, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase in IR-HepG2 cells and T1D mice. Our data suggested that JE might be a potent activator for AKT-mediated insulin signaling pathway, which was confirmed by the usage of AKT inhibitor and AKT-target siRNA interference, as well as the cellular thermal shift assay. Findings from the current study shed light on the anti-diabetic effects of phenolipids in the Syzygium species, which supports the use of medicinal plants in the Syzygium genus for potential pharmaceutical applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
