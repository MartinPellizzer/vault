In this study, ethanol extract from flowers of Verbascum cheiranthifolium Boiss. (Scrophulariaceae) was examined for their effect on mortality and progeny production against adults of Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) on two commodities, wheat and barley. The botanical extract was applied at five dose rates, which 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3% (w/v). Adults of R. dominica were exposed to the treated wheat and peeled barley at 25 degrees C and 65% RH and mortality was assessed after 24 h, 48 h, 7 day, 14 day and 21 day of exposure. Then all adults were removed and the treated substrate remained at the same conditions for an additional 45 day after this interval, the commodities were checked for progeny production. In two commodities mortality increased with the increase of dose and exposure interval. Results indicated that on wheat, mortality was 100% after 14 days of exposure at the highest dose rate. Whereas, in the same conditions mortality of adults on barley was 63%. Thus plant extract was more effective against adults of R. dominica on wheat than application of barley. Interestingly in two diets, complete suppression (100%) of the progeny production was observed in the treated wheat and barley than in control even in the lowest dose rate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khoshnoud", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nemati", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amirnia", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghiyasi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghourttapeh", "ForeName": "A Hasanzadeh", "Initials": "AH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tajbakhsh", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Talati", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Salehzadeh", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101247723", "ISSNLinking": "1028-8880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Coleoptera"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hordeum"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Insect Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Verbascum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18819578", "10.3923/pjbs.2008.783.787"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
