It is closely associated with the occurrence of several chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Some edible and medicinal plants show anti-obesity activity, such as fruits, vegetables, spices, legumes, edible flowers, mushrooms, and medicinal plants. Numerous studies have indicated that these plants are potential candidates for the prevention and management of obesity. The major anti-obesity mechanisms of plants include suppressing appetite, reducing the absorption of lipids and carbohydrates, inhibiting adipogenesis and lipogenesis, regulating lipid metabolism, increasing energy expenditure, regulating gut microbiota, and improving obesity-related inflammation. In this review, the anti-obesity activity of edible and medicinal plants was summarized based on epidemiological, experimental, and clinical studies, with related mechanisms discussed, which provided the basis for the research and development of slimming products. Further studies should focus on the exploration of safer plants with anti-obesity activity and the identification of specific anti-obesity mechanisms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Food, Nutrition and Health, Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Ao", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4162-1511"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Plants and Human Health, Institute of Urban Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chengdu, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu National Agricultural Science and Technology Center (NASC), Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Gan", "ForeName": "Ren-You", "Initials": "RY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Food, Nutrition and Health, Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Yu", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Food, Nutrition and Health, Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Mao", "ForeName": "Qian-Qian", "Initials": "QQ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9794-2269"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Agriculture and Food, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Pang-Zhen", "Initials": "PZ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2332-8554"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Food, Nutrition and Health, Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hua-Bin", "Initials": "HB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Obesity Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Obesity Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32462901", "10.1080/10408398.2020.1769548"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
