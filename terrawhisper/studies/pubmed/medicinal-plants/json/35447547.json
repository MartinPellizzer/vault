N.E.Br. (Syns: = Stapelia quadrangula Forssk. = Monolluma quadrangula Forssk.) is an indigenous member of the genus Caralluma and it is a rather common species on rocky hillsides in the southwestern part of Saudi Arabia. Several members of this genus have found medicinal uses in the treatment of rheumatism, diabetes, leprosy and as antiseptics and disinfectants. All parts are edible but rather more bitter and can cause diarrhea.", "The present report was tentatively elucidated the structure of acylated and non-acylated polyoxypregnane glycosides from Caralluma quadrangula.", "The analyses were performed using an electrospray-ionization quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI-Q-TOF) mass spectrometer in both positive and negative ionization modes to explore fragmentation pathways. The antioxidant and prooxidant properties of the different mobility portions of human plasma were evaluated in vitro using thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay (TBARS).", "The analyses showed sixty-five characteristic ion peaks which could be more efficient to assignment the aglycones and fragmentation sequences of sugar moieties. The used ionization modes provided consistent and/or complementary information for most of the pregnane glycosides, their fragmentation sequences, and their aglycones. A DFT Study was performed to elucidate the neutral loss of H<sub>2</sub>O molecules sequences from aglycones and the esterification linkage.", "This report could be useful to reduce material consuming and time in phytochemistry analysis of the different medicinal plants. The two portions significantly depleted TBARS were subjected to autoperoxidation assay in the presence of hydrogen peroxide."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
