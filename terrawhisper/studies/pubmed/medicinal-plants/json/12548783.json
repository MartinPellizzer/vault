During elicitation, the accumulation patterns of saponin in suspension cultured cells were changed, the culture time for maximum biosynthesis of saponin was shortened 2-4 days comparing with that of the control, and about 80% of biosynthetic saponin in elicited cells was secreted into medium, meanwhile the uptake for sucrose in medium of cells was enhanced, and the disturbing of pH in medium was observed, which predicated that an ion exchange occurred between elicited cells and medium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuhan Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430074."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Shi Yan Sheng Wu Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "0413570", "ISSNLinking": "0001-5334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12548783"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
