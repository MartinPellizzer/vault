PGR (100 mg/kg) was orally administered, twice a day, for 2 successive weeks (2W-group) or 7 successive weeks (7W-group). Vertical and horizontal motor activities increased significantly in the 7W-group but not in the 2W-group when compared to those of the control group. As to brain monoamine-related substances, the metabolism of DA and NE in the cerebral cortex and of 5-HT in the corpus striatum and cerebellum in the 2W-group were facilitated, while metabolism of DA in the corpus striatum and of 5-HT in the hypothalamus and midbrain were inhibited. In the 7W-group, except for a facilitated metabolism of 5-HT in the cerebellum, metabolism of DA, NE and 5-HT in all discrete brain areas were inhibited. These results show that PGR exerts an influence on the CNS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Itoh", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zang", "ForeName": "Y F", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Murai", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saito", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biogenic Monoamines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biogenic Monoamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2813579", "10.1055/s-2006-962058"]}}]}
