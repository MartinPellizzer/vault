Crude drug from several medicinal plants of genus Asarum (MA) known as Asari Radix et Rhizoma (ARR) has been proven to have the functions of dispelling cold, relieving pain, and reducing phlegm according to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory for thousands of years.", "This article reviews the ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and metabolic kinetics related research of genus Asarum to evaluate its ethnopharmacology use and future opportunities for research.", "Information on relevant studies of the genus Asarum was gathered via the Internet using Baidu Scholar, Web of Science, Elsevier, ResearchGate, ACS, Pudmed and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Additionally, information was also obtained from some local books, PhD, MS's dissertations and Pharmacopeias.", "The genus Asarum has played an important role in herbal treatment. At present, more than 277 compounds have been isolated or identified from genus Asarum. Among them, volatile oil and lignans are the major active constituents and important chemotaxonomic markers. Modern pharmacological studies indicated that genus Asarum and its active compounds possess a wide range of pharmacological effects, especially analgesic, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, cardiovascular protection, antitussive, immunosuppressive, anti-tumor, and microbicidal activities.", "Based on this review, therapeutic potential of genus Asarum has been demonstrated with the pharmacological effects on inflammation, CNS, respiratory regulation, cardiovascular diseases, cancer and microbial infection. The available literature showed that the major activities of the genus Asarum can be attributed to the active lignans and essential oils. Further in-depth studies on the aspects of the genus for mechanism of actions, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, drug interactions, and clinical trials are still limited, thereby intensive research and assessments should be performed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
