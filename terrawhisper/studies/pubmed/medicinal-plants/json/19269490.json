ILs, its concentration and MAE conditions were investigated in order to extract polyphenolic compounds effectively from Psidium guajava Linn. (P. guajava) leaves and Smilax china (S. china) tubers. The results obtained indicated that the anions and cations of ILs had influences on the extraction of polyphenolic compounds as well as the ILs with electron-rich aromatic pi-system enhanced extraction ability. Under the optimized conditions, the extraction yields of the polyphenolic compounds were in the range of 79.5-93.8% with one-step extraction, and meanwhile the recoveries were in the range of 85.2-103% with relative standard deviations (R.S.D.s) lower than 5.6%. Compared to conventional extraction procedures, the results suggested that the proposed method was effective and alternative for the extraction of polyphenolic compounds from medicinal plants. In addition, the extraction mechanisms and the structures of samples before and after extraction were also investigated. ILs solutions as green solvents in the MAE of polyphenolic compounds from medicinal plant samples showed a great promising prospect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Fu-You", "Initials": "FY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hua", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Xue-Jun", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Gong-Ke", "Initials": "GK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Talanta", "NlmUniqueID": "2984816R", "ISSNLinking": "0039-9140"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ionic Liquids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ionic Liquids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methods"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microwaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Psidium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19269490", "10.1016/j.talanta.2009.01.040", "S0039-9140(09)00101-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
