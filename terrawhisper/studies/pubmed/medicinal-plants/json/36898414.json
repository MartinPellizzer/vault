Eriocalyxin B (Eri B), an ent-kaurane diterpenoid isolating from Isodon eriocalyx var. laxiflora, has previously been reported to have anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects in breast cancer. Here, we investigated the effect of Eri B on cell migration and adhesion in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, as well as aldehyde dehydrogenases 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1) expression, colony- and sphere-formation in cancer stem cell (CSC) enriched MDA-MB-231 cells. The in vivo anti-metastatic activities of Eri B were determined in 3 different breast tumor-bearing mouse models. Our results indicated that Eri B inhibited TNBC cell migration and adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, and also reduced ALDH1A1 expression and colony formation in CSC-enriched MDA-MB-231 cells. The metastasis-related pathways, such as epidermal growth factor receptor/ mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 1/2/ extracellular regulated protein kinase signaling altered by Eri B was firstly shown in MDA-MB-231 cells. The potent anti-metastatic efficacies of Eri B were demonstrated in breast xenograft-bearing mice and syngeneic breast tumor-bearing mice. Gut microbiome analysis results revealed the change in the diversity and composition of microbiome after Eri B treatment, and the potential pathways that are involved in the anti-cancer efficacy of Eri B. In conclusion, Eri B was shown to inhibit breast cancer metastasis in both in vitro and in vivo models. Our findings further support the development of Eri B as an anti-metastatic agent for breast cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
