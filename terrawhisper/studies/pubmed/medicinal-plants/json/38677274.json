Although oxidative stress, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are established factors in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, the precise molecular pathways remain elusive. Further exploration of the pathogenesis and identification of novel molecular targets are imperative. Recent studies have implicated the Sirtuins family in various physiological and pathological processes, suggesting their potential in ameliorating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Moreover, research on Sirtuins has discovered small-molecule compounds or medicinal plants with regulatory effects, representing a notable advancement in preventing and treating DOX-induced cardiac injury.", "In this review, we delve into the pathogenesis of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and explore the therapeutic effects of Sirtuins in mitigating this condition, along with the associated molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, we delineate the roles and mechanisms of small-molecule regulators of Sirtuins in the prevention and treatment of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.", "Data for this review were sourced from various scientific databases (such as Web of Science, PubMed and Science Direct) up to March 2024. Search terms included \"Sirtuins,\" \"DOX-induced cardiotoxicity,\" \"DOX,\" \"Sirtuins regulators,\" \"histone deacetylation,\" among others, as well as several combinations thereof.", "Members of the Sirtuins family regulate both the onset and progression of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through anti-inflammatory, antioxidative stress and anti-apoptotic mechanisms, as well as by maintaining mitochondrial stability. Moreover, natural plant-derived active compounds such as Resveratrol (RES), curcumin, berberine, along with synthetic small-molecule compounds like EX527, modulate the expression and activity of Sirtuins.", "The therapeutic role of the Sirtuins family in mitigating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity represents a potential molecular target. However, further research is urgently needed to elucidate the relevant molecular mechanisms and to assess the safety and biological activity of Sirtuins regulators. This review offers an in-depth understanding of the therapeutic role of the Sirtuins family in mitigating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, providing a preliminary basis for the clinical application of Sirtuins regulators in this condition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
