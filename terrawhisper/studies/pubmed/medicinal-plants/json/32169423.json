The huge number of lives it takes and the resistance of malaria parasites to current drugs necessitate the search for new effective antimalarial drugs. Medicinal plants have been the major source of such drugs and A.\u00a0pirottae is one of these plants used traditionally for the treatment of malaria in Ethiopia.", "This study was aimed at evaluating the antimalarial activity of the aqueous extract of A.\u00a0pirottae against chloroquine sensitive P. berghei in mice.", "The extract was obtained by macerating the latex of A.\u00a0pirottae with distilled water. To determine its antiplasmodial activity, a 4-day suppressive model was used by dividing 40 mice into five groups of 8 mice each and given 200, 400 & 600mg/kg of the extract, the standard drug (chloroquine 25mg/kg) and the vehicle (distilled water). Then parasite suppression by the extract, survival time and prevention of loss of body weight, rectal temperature and packed cell volume were assessed. All data were presented as the Mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fSEM (Standard Error of the Mean) and analyzed using IBM SPSS version 20.", "The extract showed moderate antimalarial activity by significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) suppressing parasitemia at all dose levels with maximum parasitemia suppression of 47.0% and significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) increasing survival time. Furthermore, 400\u202fmg/kg and 600\u202fmg/kg doses showed significant (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) prevention of loss in body weight, rectal temperature and packed cell volume.", "Based to the results of this study, A.\u00a0pirottae is endowed with a moderate antimalarial activity that is in agreement with the traditional claim of A.\u00a0pirottae, hence may be used as a basis for further studies to be conducted on antimalarial activity of the plant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
