In September 1997 and again in 1998, a previously undescribed disease was noticed on fully grown coneflower plants in Summerland and Oliver, British Columbia. Mycelia were observed on stems, foliage, and flowers, and distinct dark red to black, round (approximately 5 mm in diameter) lesions were observed on the flower petals. The disease appeared similar to powdery mildews that have been reported on numerous genera of the Asteraceae. Samples of the diseased tissue were examined and the salient features of the fungus on two specimens were determined: cleistothecia infrequent, subglobose or flattened on the side next to the leaf surface, 121 to 209 \u03bcm in diameter; epidermal (surface) cells 20 \u03bcm in diameter; appendages hyphoid, 5 \u03bcm in diameter, up to 200 \u03bcm long; asci, 10 to 19 in each cleistothecium, broadly ellipsoid, 47 to 85 \u00d7 28 to 37 \u03bcm with a short stalk, about 8 to 13 \u03bcm long and 8 \u03bcm in diameter; ascospores, immature, two per ascus, ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid, 17 to 25 \u00d7 11 to 13 \u03bcm, thin walled, hyaline, and smooth; conidia oblong with sides slightly convex and apices truncate, 27 to 40 \u00d7 14 to 20 \u03bcm, walls hyaline, thin, smooth. Based on the occurrence of asci that contained two ascospores and the hyphoid appendages on the cleistothecia we concluded that the fungus was Erysiphe cichoracearum DC. Damage due to this disease was minimal in 1997 and 1998 because it developed very late in the growing season and occurred sporadically within the plantings. In order to complete Koch's postulates, Echinacea purpurea plants grown in the greenhouse were inoculated with a conidial suspension (10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> conidia per ml) from field-infected plants. Powdery mildew first appeared 3 months later, eventually infecting leaves and stems of 12 of 49 inoculated plants. It was distinctly white and in discrete patches on leaves, compared with coalescing dark brown areas on the stems. Microscopic examination of the conidia confirmed that they were E. cichoracearum. Although powdery mildew caused by E. cichoracearum has been widely reported on lettuce, safflower, and other cultivated and wild Compositae, we found no reference to it on Echinacea spp. in Canada (1,2), the U.S. (3), or elsewhere in the world (4). The specimens have been deposited in the National Mycological Herbarium of Canada (DAOM) with accession numbers 225933 and 225934 for Oliver and Summerland, B.C., respectively. References: (1) U.
