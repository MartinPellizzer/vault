The aqueous extract of Murraya koenigii leaves has been taken to evaluate the hypoglycemic activity in normal and alloxan induced diabetic rabbits. This plant is promising as it is widely and regularly used as a spice for food flavoring and as such it appears to be without any side effects and toxicity. Adequate characterization of hypoglycemic activity of aqueous extract has not been yet done, as no such reports are available in the literature though the activity is reported. The scientific evaluation of its hypoglycemic activity was, therefore, explored and also compared with the effect of a standard hypoglycemic drug, tolbutamide. A single oral administration of variable dose levels (200, 300 and 400 mg/kg) of aqueous extract led to lowering of blood glucose level in normal as well as in diabetic rabbits. The maximum fall of 14.68% in normal and 27.96% in mild diabetic was observed after 4 h of oral administration of 300 mg/kg. The same dose also showed a marked improvement in glucose tolerance of 46.25% in sub-diabetic (AR) and 38.5% in mild diabetic rabbits in glucose tolerance test after 2 h. The findings from this study suggest that the aqueous extract of these leaves may be prescribed as adjunct to dietary therapy and drug treatment for controlling diabetes mellitus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Alternative Therapeutics Unit, Drug Development Division, Medicinal Research Lab, Department of Chemistry, University of Allahabad, Allahabad 211002, India. achyut_nar@yahoo.co.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kesari", "ForeName": "Achyut Narayan", "Initials": "AN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Rajesh Kumar", "Initials": "RK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watal", "ForeName": "Geeta", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "982XCM1FOI", "NameOfSubstance": "Tolbutamide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Murraya"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Tolbutamide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15707761", "10.1016/j.jep.2004.11.006", "S0378-8741(04)00565-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
