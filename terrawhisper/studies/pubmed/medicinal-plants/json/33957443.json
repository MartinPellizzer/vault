This study attempted to assess multi-platform information as a practical strategy for the geographical traceability of the fruits of Amomum tsao-ko. To this aim, one hundred and eighty dried fruits of A. tsao-ko from five geographical regions were analyzed by near infrared (NIR) and ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. On this basis, two variable dimension reduction strategies, including principal component analysis (PCA) and sequential and orthogonalized partial-least squares (SO-PLS), and two variables selection strategies, including variable importance in projection (VIP) and sequential and orthogonalized covariance selection (SO-CovSel), were performed to extract the feature information in the two blocks. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) classification algorithm combined with fused matrices was used to identify the geographical origins. The results of PLS-DA models indicated that SO-PLS and SO-CovSel, taking advantage of the sequential modeling coupled to orthogonalization, could not only identify the common information presented in the two blocks but also provide more concise methods without any loss of classification ability, which could be employed in authenticating the geographical regions of the fruits of A. tsao-ko, effectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
