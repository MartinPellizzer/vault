This compound has been reported to exhibit antimicrobial properties in vitro in laboratory media and in animal feeds and human foods contaminated with disease-causing bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica. This integrated review surveys and interprets our current knowledge of the chemistry, analysis, safety, mechanism of action, and antibiotic activities of cinnamaldehyde in food animal (cattle, lambs, calves, pigs, poultry) diets and in widely consumed liquid (apple, carrot, tomato, and watermelon juices, milk) and solid foods. Solid foods include various fruits (bayberries, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries), vegetables (carrots, celery, lettuce, spinach, cucumbers, and tomatoes), meats (beef, ham, pork, and frankfurters), poultry (chickens and turkeys), seafood (oysters and shrimp), bread, cheese, eggs, infant formula, and peanut paste. The described findings are not only of fundamental interest but also have practical implications for food safety, nutrition, and animal and human health. The collated information and suggested research needs will hopefully facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of cinnamaldehyde alone and in combination with other natural antimicrobials and medicinal antibiotics to help prevent and treat food animal and human diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2582-7517"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Healthy Processed Foods Research, Western Regional Research Center, Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture , Albany, California 94710, United States."}], "LastName": "Friedman", "ForeName": "Mendel", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Food Additives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7864XYD3JJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Acrolein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SR60A3XG0F", "NameOfSubstance": "cinnamaldehyde"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acrolein"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Additives"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Livestock"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Meat"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29155570", "10.1021/acs.jafc.7b04344"]}}]}
