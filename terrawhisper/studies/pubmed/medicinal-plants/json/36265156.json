To retain the best medicinal properties, growers imitated the original ecological planting method for cultivating <i>C. pilosula</i> in hillside fields in Wutai county, Shanxi province, China. In July and August 2021 and 2022, stem canker disease was observed in <i>C. pilosula</i>. The basal part of the stems showed slightly sunken brown lesions, and the disease incidence was up to 20% in the investigated fields (6.67 ha). To identify the causal agents of stem canker, 12 small pieces (approximately 5 mm long) from 12 diseased samples (one piece per sample) were cut from the border of the lesions, surface-sterilized (70% ethanol for 30 s, 0.5% NaClO for 3 min), washed three times with sterile water, and then incubated on water agar (WA) at 25 \u00b0C for 24 h. Isolates with right-angle branching, a septum near the branch, and a slight constriction at the branch base were selected, and their hyphal tips were transferred onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates. After incubation at 25 \u00b0C, 12 <i>Rhizoctonia</i>-like isolates (Dcp-19 to Dcp-30) with white colonies were obtained. White monilioid cells in aerial mycelia formed as they aged but did not produce sclerotia. Based on nuclear fluorescence staining with 1 \u03bcg\u00b7mL<sup>-1</sup> 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole as described by Ahvenniemi et al. (2009), there were two nuclei per hyphal cell for all the 12 isolates. Moreover, the sequences of internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA (rDNA-ITS) of all the 12 isolates were amplified using the primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990). For identical sequences, only the rDNA-ITS sequence (674 bp) of Dcp-19 has been deposited in GenBank (accession no. ON004932) and BLASTn analyses showed 100% homology with Rhizoctonia AG-K (MF070696). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis further confirmed the identification. Healthy <i>C. pilosula</i> plants grown for two years in hillside fields were transplanted into sterile soil for pathogenicity testing. And the 12 isolates were all done in this test. Sterilized wheat seeds were placed on a 2-day-old colony of the isolate and incubated for 7 days. One fungus-infested seed was placed at the base of the stem and covered with sterilized soil. Control plants were inoculated with sterilized wheat seeds. Tests were performed on three plants for each isolate. The experiment was repeated twice. All the plants were cultivated at 22 \u00b0C and 50% relative humidity. After three weeks, the basal stems of the control plants were still healthy and did not have lesions, but the treated plants exhibited sunken brown canker lesions. The mean disease incidence of all the 12 isolates was 58.33%. The AG-K isolates re-isolated from the lesions of treated plants were confirmed by the morphological and molecular characteristics mentioned above, fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of stem canker on <i>C. pilosula</i> caused by binucleate <i>Rhizoctonia</i> AG-K in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinzhou Teachers University, 66353, Department of Biology, Xinzhou, Shanxi , China; xzsysxj@sina.com."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Xiaojing", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinzhou Teachers University, 66353, Department of Biology, Xinzhou, Shanxi , China; dragonwhj@sina.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Huajie", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinzhou Teachers University, 66353, Department of Biology, Xinzhou, Shanxi , China; 2762609343@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinzhou Teachers University, 66353, Department of Biology, Xinzhou, Shanxi , China; 852372033@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinzhou Teachers University, 66353, Department of Biology, Xinzhou, Shanxi , China; 2721758743@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36265156", "10.1094/PDIS-08-22-1801-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
