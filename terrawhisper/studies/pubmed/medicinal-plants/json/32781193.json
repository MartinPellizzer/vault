Our long-term goal is to compare the transcriptomes of cultivars with different cannabinoid profiles for therapeutic purposes. Here we describe the de novo assembly, annotation and initial analysis of two cultivars of Cannabis, a high THC variety and a CBD plus THC variety. Cultivars were grown under different lighting conditions; flower buds were sampled over 71\u00a0days. Cannabinoid profiles were determined by ESI-LC/MS. RNA samples were sequenced using the HiSeq4000 platform. Transcriptomes were assembled using the DRAP pipeline and annotated using the BLAST2GO pipeline and other tools. Each transcriptome contained over twenty thousand protein encoding transcripts with ORFs and flanking sequence. Identification of transcripts for cannabinoid pathway and related enzymes showed full-length ORFs that align with the draft genomes of the Purple Kush and Finola cultivars. Two transcripts were found for olivetolic acid cyclase (OAC) that mapped to distinct locations on the Purple Kush genome suggesting multiple genes for OAC are expressed in some cultivars. The ability to make high quality annotated reference transcriptomes in Cannabis or other plants can promote rapid comparative analysis between cultivars and growth conditions in Cannabis and other organisms without annotated genome assemblies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
