Treatment of such diseases with small-molecule NIK inhibitors is a reasonable but underexplored approach. In this paper, we reported the discovery of a potent and selective NIK inhibitor <b>46</b> (XT2). <b>46</b> inhibited the NIK kinase with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 9.1 nM in vitro, and it also potently suppressed NIK activities in intact cells. In isogenic primary hepatocytes, treatment of <b>46</b> efficiently suppressed the expressions of NIK-induced genes. <b>46</b> was orally bioavailable in mice with moderate systemic exposure. In a NIK-associated mouse liver inflammation model, <b>46</b> suppressed CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced upregulation of ALT, a key biomarker of acute liver injury. <b>46</b> also decreased immune cell infiltration into the injured liver tissue. Overall, these studies provide examples that an NIK inhibitor is able to suppress toxin-induced liver inflammations, which indicates its therapeutic potentials for the treatment of liver inflammatory diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of
