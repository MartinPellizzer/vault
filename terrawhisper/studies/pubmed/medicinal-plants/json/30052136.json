Its cytotoxicity was investigated on two cancer cell lines, HCT116 and CT26, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as normal cells employing MTT assay. Moreover, Farnesiferol C interactions with ct-DNA and HSA were investigated by various techniques. The IC<sub>50</sub> values of Farnesiferol C on HCT116 and CT26 cells were 42 and 46\u2009\u03bcM, respectively, while its IC<sub>50</sub> value on MSCs cells was 92\u2009\u03bcM, indicating that Farnesiferol C was more efficacious against cancer cell lines than normal cells. DNA competitive binding studies, viscosity and zeta potential measurements confirmed that Farnesiferol C bound to DNA through intercalation binding. HSA binding investigations revealed that there were two different binding sites for Far C on HSA with higher binding affinity in site 2 compared to site 1. Furthermore, Farnesiferol C could bind to HSA and quench its intrinsic fluorescence in a static quenching mechanism, with a distance of 2.54\u2009nm. Competitive binding in the presence of warfarin and ibuprofen was carried out and the resulting quenching constant was strongly changed in the presence of warfarin. Consequently, Farnesiferol C most probably will be located within sub-domain IIA. In this study, molecular modeling buttressed and confirmed our laboratory results. Conclusively, we proposed that DNA is an appropriate target for Farnesiferol C. Therefore, Farnesiferol C and its semisynthetic analogues can be one of the priority innovations in research on anticancer drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Research Center for Molecular Medicine , Hamadan University of Medical Sciences , Hamadan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Tanzadehpanah", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Research Center for Molecular Medicine , Hamadan University of Medical Sciences , Hamadan , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Immunology, School of Medicine , Hamadan University of Medical Sciences , Hamadan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahaki", "ForeName": "Hanie", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Research Center for Molecular Medicine , Hamadan University of Medical Sciences , Hamadan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Samadi", "ForeName": "Pouria", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine , Hamadan University of Medical Sciences , Hamadan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Karimi", "ForeName": "Jamshid", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Faculty of Chemistry , Bu-Ali Sina University , Hamedan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Moghadam", "ForeName": "Neda Hosseinpour", "Initials": "NH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Faculty of Chemistry , Bu-Ali Sina University , Hamedan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Salehzadeh", "ForeName": "Sadegh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center , Hamadan University of Medical Sciences , Hamadan , Iran Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
