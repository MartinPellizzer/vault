Both quantitative and qualitative characters of the pollens were analyzed. The shapes of the pollen were prolate, spheroidal, elliptical, and oblate. Exine sculpturing showed rugulate, scabrate, psilate gemmate, and reticulate ornamentation. The people residing in the rural areas are thought to depend, primarily, on medicinal plant resources for many health care needs. A sample of 140 respondents was selected and interviewed by using a stratified random sampling technique. Results showed that the local communities of lower Margalla Hills are highly dependent on plants to treat various ailments, for example, respiratory (28%), digestive (46%) nervous, circulatory and dermatological problems (6% each), and reproductive problems (8%). The continuous dependence of the local community on ethnomedicinally important plants has led to serious degradation of the natural forest of lower Margalla Hills. Priority-based conservation and sustainable use of these forest resources are necessary, and use of alternative resources will also help in the forest conservation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1Department of Anthropology,Quaid-i-Azam University,Islamabad 45320,Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sufyan", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1Department of Anthropology,Quaid-i-Azam University,Islamabad 45320,Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Badshah", "ForeName": "Ikram", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2Department of Plant Sciences,Quaid-i-Azam University,Islamabad 45320,Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Mushtaq", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2Department of Plant Sciences,Quaid-i-Azam University,Islamabad 45320,Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Zafar", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2Department of Plant Sciences,Quaid-i-Azam University,Islamabad 45320,Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Bahadur", "ForeName": "Saraj", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2Department of Plant Sciences,Quaid-i-Azam University,Islamabad 45320,Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rashid", "ForeName": "Neelam", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Microsc Microanal", "NlmUniqueID": "9712707", "ISSNLinking": "1431-9276"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29952283", "10.1017/S1431927618000326", "S1431927618000326"]}}]}
