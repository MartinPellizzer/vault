Attempt to understand the mode of action of the anticonvulsant activity of the plant, three notable antagonists (flumazenil, 3 mg/kg; naloxone 5 mg/kg, i.p., and cyproheptadine, 4 mg/kg, i.p) were used.", "The results revealed a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the frequency of rearing and grooming episodes compared with the control. The extract of P. staudtii potentiates the sleeping time of hexobarbitone-induced hypnosis in a dose-related manner. P. staudtii stem bark extracts significantly (p<0.05) prolonged the onset of a seizure and attenuated the duration of seizure in a dose-dependent manner in picrotoxin- and or isoniazid-induced seizures. While, P. staudtii stem bark extract at all doses (100, 200, and 400 mg kg-1) though significantly prolonged the onset of action, but did not confer any significant changes on the duration, as well as mortality in this strychnine-induced seizure model. However, the anticonvulsant activity of the methanolic extract of P. staudtii was significantly reversed following intraperitoneal pre-treatment with flumazenil (GABA receptor antagonist) and naloxone (opioid receptor antagonist) but not cyproheptadine (5-HT2 receptor antagonist) in picrotoxin-induced convulsion.", "The data obtained suggest that methanol extract of P. staudtii possessed significant anticonvulsant effect, thereby confirming the traditional uses of P. staudtii in the treatment of epilepsy; mechanisms of which could involve the interaction with GABAergic and or opioidergic system."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Health Sciences Osogbo, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Wakeel", "ForeName": "Olayemi K", "Initials": "OK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Health Sciences Osogbo, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Awosan", "ForeName": "Oluropo B", "Initials": "OB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Health Sciences Osogbo, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Kolawole", "ForeName": "Oyetunji T", "Initials": "OT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Health Sciences Osogbo, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ayankunle", "ForeName": "Akeem A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Health Sciences Osogbo, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Onaolapo", "ForeName": "Olukunle J", "Initials": "OJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Adeyeba", "ForeName": "Oluwaseyi A", "Initials": "OA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Cent Nerv Syst Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101269163", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5249"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticonvulsants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "124-87-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrotoxin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anticonvulsants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Picrotoxin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Seizures"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests, Acute"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32072918", "10.2174/1871524920666200211113633", "CNSAMC-EPUB-104387"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
