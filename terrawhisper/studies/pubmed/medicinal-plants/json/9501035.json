Transcripts of this construct were replicated in the presence of RNA-1 in cowpea protoplasts, and GFP expression could be readily detected by fluorescent microscopy. It was not possible to infect cowpea plants with these transcripts, but combined with a mutant RNA-2, in which the 48-kDa movement protein (MP) gene has been deleted infection did occur. With this tripartite virus (CPMV-TRI) green fluorescent spots were visible under UV light on the inoculated leaf after 3 days and a few days later on the higher leaves. These results show that the polyproteins encoded by RNA-2 do not possess an essential function in the virus infection cycle and that there is, contrary to what we have found so far for the proteins encoded by RNA-1, no need for a tight regulation of the amounts of MP and CPs produced in a cell. Subsequently, the GFP gene was introduced between the MP and CP genes of RNA-2 utilizing artificial proteolytic processing sites for the viral proteinase. This CPMV-GFP was highly infectious on cowpea plants and the green fluorescent spots that developed on the inoculated leaves were larger and brighter than those produced by CPMV-TRI described above. When cowpea plants were inoculated with CPMV RNA-1 and RNA-2 mutants containing the GFP gene but lacking the CP or MP genes, only single fluorescent epidermal cells were detected between 2 and 6 days postinoculation. This experiment clearly shows that both the capsid proteins and the MP are absolutely required for cell-to-cell movement."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology, Agricultural University, Wageningen, The Netherlands."}], "LastName": "Verver", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wellink", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Van Lent", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gopinath", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Van Kammen", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Virology", "NlmUniqueID": "0110674", "ISSNLinking": "0042-6822"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Luminescent Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Viral Movement Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "147336-22-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Green Fluorescent Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Capsid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Comovirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Deletion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Green Fluorescent Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Luminescent Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Movement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Viral Movement Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Protoplasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Scyphozoa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Viral Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "3", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9501035", "10.1006/viro.1997.8982", "S0042-6822(97)98982-0"]}}]}
