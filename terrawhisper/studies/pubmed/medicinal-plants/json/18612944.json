Pharmacological and phytochemical studies have resulted in the identification of the anxiolytic and sedative principle consisting of a mixture of nor-secofriedelanes, named the galphimine series (1 - 9). These active constituents were found in plants collected in the vicinity of a restricted region in Central Mexico, where this species is abundant. A metabolic profiling carried out by means of 1H-NMR spectroscopy and multivariate data analysis was applied to crude extracts from wild plant populations, collected from six different locations as a quality control assessment, in order to differentiate their chemical profile. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the 1H-NMR spectra revealed clear variations among the populations, with two populations out of the six studied manifesting differences, when the principal components PC-1 and PC-2 were analyzed. These two PCs permitted the differentiation of the various sample populations, depending on the presence of galphimines. This information consistently correlated with the corresponding HPLC analysis. The neuropharmacological effects of the crude extracts were evaluated by using ICR mice in the elevated plus maze, as well as the sodium pentobarbital-induced hypnosis models. Both assays demonstrated anxiolytic and sedative responses only among those sample populations which had previously been differentiated by PC-1. Partial least square regression-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) also confirmed a strong correlation between the observed effects and the metabolic profiles of the plants. The overall results of this study confirm the benefits of using metabolic profiling for the in silico analysis of active principles in medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Biotecnolog\u00eda, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma del Estado de Morelos, Cuernavaca, Morelos, M\u00e9xico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cardoso-Taketa", "ForeName": "Alexandre T", "Initials": "AT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pereda-Miranda", "ForeName": "Rogelio", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Young Hae", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Verpoorte", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Villarreal", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda Luisa", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Galphimia glauca extract"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypnotics and Sedatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Galphimia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hypnotics and Sedatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18612944", "10.1055/s-2008-1074583"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
