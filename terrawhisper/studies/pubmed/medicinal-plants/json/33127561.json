Polygonum orientale L.) is a potent medicinal herb widely used in many ethnic groups, such as the Han, Tibetan, Mongolian, Zhuang, Miao, Yao, Yi, Korean, Dong, Hani, Lisu, Naxi and She people in China. Aims of the review: This article aims to present the research progress on P. orientalis, which is helpful to understand the multi-purpose of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) and prompt its medicinal value.", "Information on P. orientalis was obtained from published materials, including monographs on medicinal plants, ancient and modern recorded classics, pharmacopoeias and electronic databases, such as Web of Science, Science Direct, Springer, AGRIS, Europe PMC, SCI Finder, PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang DATA, J-STAGE, classical treatises of modern pharmaceutical science and Flora Reipublicae Popularis Sinicae (FRPS).", "Clinical applications of traditional medicine of P. orientalis have therapeutic effects for dispelling rheumatism, promoting digestion, aiding diuresis and activating blood circulation. A total of 153 chemical constituents have been identified from P. orientalis, including flavonoids, carboxylic acids, phenolic acids, amino acids, hydrocarbons, chromones, lignans, volatile oils, amides and other components. Its active ingredients have a wide range of pharmacological effects, such as anti-oxidative, anti-aging, anti-inflammation, analgesia, anti-myocardial ischemia, anti-abortion, and anti-rheumatoid arthritis, as well as protective effects on cerebral ischemia and liver injury. By establishing stable detection methods, the quality standards of P. orientalis medicinal materials have been guaranteed, such as determination of the iconic components, harvesting periods and optimization of specific components extraction processes.", "P. orientalis has different pharmacological activities based on the diversity of chemical constituents. However, the existing reports mainly focus on the extracts, and these studies on its corresponding compounds are not clear enough. The information suggests that P. orientalis has good potential medicinal value, and more attention should be paid to further explore its bioactive components."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
