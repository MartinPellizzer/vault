In spite of wide-ranging progress in understanding the AD pathology for the past 50 years, clinical trials based on the hypothesis of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) have reserved worsening particularly at late-stage human trials. Consequently, very few old drugs are presently used for AD with inadequate clinical consequences and various side effects. We focus on widespread pharmacological and beneficial principles for existing as well as future drugs. Multitargeting approaches by means of general antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms allied with particular receptor and/or enzyme-mediated actions in neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. The plant kingdom comprises a vast range of species with an incredible diversity of bioactive metabolites with diverse chemical scaffolds. In recent times, an increasing body of facts recommended the use of phytochemicals to decelerate AD's onset and progression. The definitive goal of AD investigation is to avert the onset of neurodegeneration, thereby allowing successful aging devoid of cognitive decline. At this point, we discussed the neurological protective role of natural products and naturally derived therapeutic agents for AD from various natural polyphenolic compounds and medicinal plants. In conclusion, medicinal plants act as a chief source of different bioactive constituents."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, School of Bioscience, Periyar University, Salem, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Mani", "ForeName": "Renuka", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, School of Bioscience, Periyar University, Salem, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Sha Sulthana", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Bioscience, Periyar University, Salem, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Muthusamy", "ForeName": "Ganesan", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9113-480X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, School of Bioscience, Periyar University, Salem, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Elangovan", "ForeName": "Namasivayam", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Appl Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "8609465", "ISSNLinking": "0885-4513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Apostolova LG, Alzheimer disease.
