However, nematode damage severely affects its yield and quality. One of the major effects of nematode infestations is the secondary infection of pathogenic bacteria or fungi through entry wounds made by the nematodes. Understanding the response of the symbiotic microbial community of yam plants to nematodes is crucial for controlling such a disease. In this study, we investigated the rhizosphere and how endophytic microbiomes shift after nematode infection during the tuber expansion stage in the <i>Dioscorea opposita</i> Thunb. cultivar Tiegun. Our results revealed that soil depth affected the abundance of nematodes, and the relative number of <i>Meloidogyne incognita</i> was higher in the diseased soil at a depth of 16 to 40 cm than those at a depth of 0 to 15 and 41 to 70 cm. The abundance of and interactions among soil microbiota members were significantly correlated with root-knot nematode (RKN) parasitism at various soil depths. However, the comparison of the microbial \u03b1-diversity and composition between healthy and diseased rhizosphere soil showed no difference. Compared with healthy soils, the co-occurrence networks of <i>M. incognita</i>-infested soils included a higher ratio of positive correlations linked to plant health. In addition, we detected a higher abundance of certain taxonomic groups belonging to Chitinophagaceae and Xanthobacteraceae in the rhizosphere of RKN-infested plants. The nematodes, besides causing direct damage to plants, also possess the ability to act synergistically with other pathogens, especially <i>Ramicandelaber</i> and <i>Fusarium</i>, leading to the development of disease complexes. In contrast to soil samples, RKN parasitism specifically had a significant effect on the composition and assembly of the root endophytic microbiota. The RKN colonization impacted a wide variety of endophytic microbiomes, including <i>Pseudomonas</i>, <i>Sphingomonas</i>, <i>Rhizobium</i>, <i>Neocosmospora</i>, and <i>Fusarium</i>. This study revealed the relationship between RKN disease and changes in the rhizosphere and endophytic microbial community, which may provide novel insights that help improve biological management of yam RKNs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6791-3838"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan International Joint Laboratory of Agricultural Microbial Ecology and Technology, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan International Joint Laboratory of Agricultural Microbial Ecology and Technology, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Liting", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan International Joint Laboratory of Agricultural Microbial Ecology and Technology, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jingjing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan International Joint Laboratory of Agricultural Microbial Ecology and Technology, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Weichao", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3568-9752"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jiangli", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan International Joint Laboratory of Agricultural Microbial Ecology and Technology, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Zhao", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan International Joint Laboratory of Agricultural Microbial Ecology and Technology, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Mingzhu", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cell Biology and Plant Biochemistry, University of Regensburg, Regensburg 93053, Germany."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Mingjun", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan International Joint Laboratory of Agricultural Microbial Ecology and Technology, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Qingxiang", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}, "CoiStatement": "The author(s) declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38549276", "10.1094/PDIS-01-24-0169-RE"]}}]}
