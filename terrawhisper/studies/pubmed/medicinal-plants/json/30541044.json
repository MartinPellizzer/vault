However, conversion of 24-methylene cholesterol to withaferin A and other withanolides has not yet been biochemically dissected. Hence, in an effort to fill this gap, an important gene, encoding S-adenosyl l-methionine-dependent sterol-C24-methyltransferase type 1 (SMT1), involved in the first committed step of sterol biosynthesis, from W. somnifera was targeted in the present study. Though SMT1 has been characterized in model plants such as Nicotiana tabacum and Arabidopsis thaliana, its functional role in phytosterol and withanolide biosynthesis was demonstrated for the first time in W. somnifera. Since SMT1 acts at many steps preceding the withanolide precursor, the impact of this gene in channeling of metabolites for withanolide biosynthesis and its regulatory nature was illustrated by suppressing the gene in W. somnifera via the RNA interference (RNAi) approach. Interestingly, down-regulation of SMT1 in W. somnifera led to reduced levels of campesterol, sitosterol and stigmasterol, with an increase of cholesterol content in the transgenic RNAi lines. In contrast, SMT1 overexpression in transgenic N. tabacum enhanced the level of all phytosterols except cholesterol, which was not affected. The results established that SMT1 plays a crucial role in W. somnifera withanolide biosynthesis predominantly through the campesterol and stigmasterol routes."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd The Author(s) 2018.
