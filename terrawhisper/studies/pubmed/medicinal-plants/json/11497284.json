Mistletoe lectins (ML) have been identified as the active principle with cytotoxic and immunomodulatory potencies. In the present in vivo experiments, the anticancer effects of an aqueous mistletoe extract (AME) were investigated in different subcutaneously growing syngeneic murine tumors such as Renca renal cell carcinoma, C8 colon 38 carcinoma, F9 testicular carcinoma, B16 melanoma and Lewis lung carcinoma. The animals used were immunocompetent mice of different strains (C57BL/6, BALB/c), depending on the type of tumor tested. After tumor transplantation, the mice were treated with AME at dose levels corresponding to 0, 0.3, 3, 30 or 300 ng ML/kg/d by the i.p. or s.c. route for a maximum of 4 consecutive weeks. The tumor volume was determined by serial caliper measurements and expressed relative to controls. Significant tumor growth inhibition was observed with the Renca , C8 colon 38 and F9 testicular carcinomas at 30 and 300 ng ML/kg/d. These findings were confirmed in independent repeat experiments. No inhibitory effects were seen with the Lewis lung carcinoma and B16 melanoma under the conditions described above. In conclusion, AME showed in vivo anticancer activity in different transplantable syngeneic murine tumor models following repeated parenteral treatment. In view of the low dose levels used, the effects are most likely due to the immunostimulatory rather than to the cytotoxic potencies of AME."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tumor Biology Center, University of Freiburg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Burger", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mengs", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sch\u00fcler", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fiebig", "ForeName": "H H", "Initials": "HH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8102988", "ISSNLinking": "0250-7005"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11497284"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
