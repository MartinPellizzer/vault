It was found that, during the processing for preparing Kan-jio and Juku-jio from Sho-jio, jio-serebroside (9) and acteoside (10) were provided, and that the iridoid glycosides were completely degradated or their contents decreased remarkably. Quantitative analysis by means of gas liquid chromatography (GLC) has confirmed that the contents of monosaccharides and oligosaccharides in Kan-jio and Juku-jio increased more than those in Sho-jio. During the course of these studies, a new iridoid glycoside named 6'-O-acetylcatalpol (2) was isolated from Japanese Sho-jio and the structure has been determined."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kitagawa", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fukuda", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Taniyama", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yoshikawa", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8587039", "10.1248/yakushi1947.115.12_992"]}}]}
