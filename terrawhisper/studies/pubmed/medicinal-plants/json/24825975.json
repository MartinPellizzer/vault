The aim of this study deals with the comparative evaluation of anti-inflammatory activity of the bark of Ficus bengalensis in plants of different age. The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by rat paw edema model induced by carrageenan for acute inflammation and cotton pellet granuloma model for chronic inflammation. Indomethacin was used as a standard drug. The various extracts were studied for their anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats and the paw volume was measured plethysmometrically from 0 to 3h after injection. We have determined the anti-inflammatory activity of various extracts of the bark of Ficus bengalensis with oral administration doses of 300 and 600 mg/kg/day of body weight to healthy animals. Positive results for flavonoids, sterols, and triterpene, tannins and saponins compounds were investigated by phytochemical analysis. The ethanolic extract of younger plant showed a greater anti-inflammatory effect compared with the standard drug indomethacin. Present studies besides confirming anti-inflammatory activity of the ethanolic extract of younger more potent than mature plant help to identify from the comparative study of the bark of Ficus bengalensis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Pharamacognosy, TVES's H'ble Loksevak Madhukarrao Chaudhari College of Pharmacy, Faizpur, Maharashtra, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Patil", "ForeName": "Vikas V", "Initials": "VV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Pharamacognosy, TVES's H'ble Loksevak Madhukarrao Chaudhari College of Pharmacy, Faizpur, Maharashtra, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Patil", "ForeName": "Vijay R", "Initials": "VR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Basic Clin Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "101599515", "ISSNLinking": "0976-0113"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24825975", "PMC3979180"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
