The result indicated that most of prepared compounds 1-18 showed potent activating effect on tyrosinase, especially for 1-2, 4, 6-7, 9 and 15. Among them, compounds 2, 4 and 9 demonstrated the best activity with EC<sub>50</sub>=1.3, 2.5 and 3.0\u03bcmol\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> respectively, much better than the positive control 8-methoxypsoralan (8-MOP, EC<sub>50</sub>=14.8\u03bcmol\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>); In B16 cells, all the tested compounds exhibited a stronger activity on melanogenesis than 8-MOP (with the value of 115%). It was interesting that derivatives substituted with halogen (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9) were generally more potent. Compounds 2 (463%) and 18 (438%) with 3 and 4-fold potency compared with 8-MOP respectively, were recognized as the most promising candidate hits for further pharmacological study of anti-vitiligo."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
