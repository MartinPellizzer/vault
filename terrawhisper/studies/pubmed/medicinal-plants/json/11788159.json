(Lupinus termis), family L. leguminosae, Cymbopogon proximus, (Halfa barr), family Gramineae, and Zygophyllum coccineum L. (Kammun quaramany), family L. Zygophyllacae on biochemical parameters in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. A dose of 1.5 ml of aqueous suspension of each herb/100 g body weight (equivalent to 75 mg/100 g b.wt.) was orally administered daily to alloxan-diabetic rats for 4 weeks. The levels of glucose, urea, creatinine and bilirubin were significantly (P<0.05) increased in plasma of alloxan-diabetic rats compared with the control group. In contrast, total protein and albumin were significantly decreased by 25 and 46%, respectively, versus control. Treatment of the diabetic rats with repeated doses of any one of the three herb suspensions could restore the changes of the above parameters to their normal levels after 4 weeks of treatment. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase (AlP) activities were significantly (P<0.05) increased in the plasma of alloxan-diabetic rats. However, acetylcholinesterase activity was significantly (P<0.05) decreased in the plasma compared with the control group, whereas, such activity did not change in brain. The activities of AST, ALT and LDH were significantly (P<0.05) decreased in the liver of alloxan-diabetic rats by 58, 21 and 40%, respectively, and such activities increased in testes by 39, 26 and 26%, respectively, compared with the control group. Also, brain LDH was significantly (P<0.05) increased. Treatment of the diabetic rats with the aqueous suspension of the tested herbs restored the activities of the above enzymes to their normal level in plasma, liver and testes. The present results showed that the herb suspensions exerted antihyperglycemic effects and consequently may alleviate liver and renal damage caused by alloxan-induced diabetes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Alexandria University, 21526, Alexandria, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mansour", "ForeName": "Hamdy A", "Initials": "HA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Newairy", "ForeName": "Al-Sayeda A", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yousef", "ForeName": "M I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sheweita", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Toxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "0361055", "ISSNLinking": "0300-483X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Egypt"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Testis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11788159", "10.1016/s0300-483x(01)00555-8", "S0300483X01005558"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
