Forty-eight rats were assigned into the I/R (n\u2009=\u200924, successfully established as I/R model) and sham (n\u2009=\u200924) groups. After collecting kidney tissues, immunohistochemistry, and microvascular density (MVD) counting were conducted for CXCR4 positive expression and MVD numbers. RTECs were assigned into the sham, blank, negative control (NC), miR-381 mimics, miR-381 inhibitor, si-CXCR4, and miR-381 inhibitor\u2009+\u2009si-CXCR4 groups. RT-qPCR and Western blotting were performed for relative expressions in tissues and cells. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by MTT assay and flow cytometry. Results showed that compared with the sham group, positive expression of CXCR4 and MVD number were higher in the I/R group, which exhibited decreased miR-381 and increased expression of CXCR4, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1\u03b1) and Tie-2. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay verified that CXCR4 is a target gene of miR-381. MiR-381 expression was lower in the miR-381 inhibitor\u2009+\u2009si-CXCR4 and miR-381 inhibitor groups and higher in the miR-381 mimics group than the blank and NC groups. Compared with the blank and NC groups, the miR-381 mimics and si-CXCR4 groups exhibited higher cell proliferation but lower cell apoptosis and expression of CXCR4, SDF1, VEGF, HIF-1\u03b1, and Tie-2, whereas the miR-381 inhibitor group exhibited the opposite trend. In conclusion, miR-381 may promote RTEC proliferation in rats with renal I/R injury by down-regulating CXCR4."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Biotechnology on Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Science, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou, P.R.
