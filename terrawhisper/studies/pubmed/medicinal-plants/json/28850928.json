Several drugs have been used in the management of wounds and a large variety of treatment modalities are available for wound repair. Among these medicines, herbal origin has been the basis of treatment and cure for healing of wounds. Pterolobium hexapetalum is well known medicinal plant of Caesalpiniaceae family was used by many tribal groups for wound treatment in India. Different extracts of P. hexapetalum leaves are evaluated for its antiradical activity and in vivo wound healing activity by excision, incision, and dead space wound models in Wistar rats, further respective phyto constituents are profiled using High Performance Liquid Chromatography. In this present study methanol extract of leaves depicted the maximum amount of phenolics and flavonoids content and also registered highest DPPH (IC<sub>50</sub><sub>:</sub> 3.40\u03bcg/mL), ABTS<sup>+</sup>(8869.36\u03bcM TE/g extract) and Superoxide (87.72%) radical scavenging activity. Methanolic leaf extract are further studied for wound healing property, highest wound contraction percentage and lowest epithelialization period (16.33days) of 5% methanolic extract treated group exhibits highest wound healing activity compare to control group and it was confirmed by histopathology results and scoring analysis. Maximum tensile strain (110.69%) of incision and highest hydroxyproline (16.28mg/g) content of dead space wound model are comparable with standard 5% Neomycin. HPLC employed quantification of phyto constituents explores the presence of catechin (367.54\u03bcg/mg), caffeic acid (87\u03bcg/mg), rutin (289.20\u03bcg/mg), quercetin (239.39\u03bcg/mg) and naringenin (24.42\u03bcg/mg). From the results leaves of P. hexapetalum significantly stimulate wound contraction, braking strength and hydroxyproline content of treated group. It showed remarkable wound healing activity and may be recommended for treating various type of wound."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.
