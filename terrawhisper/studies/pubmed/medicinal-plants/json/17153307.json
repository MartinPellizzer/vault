That can be regarded as a historical milestone which characterizes temporarily the end of a development that, starting at the botanical characterization of the white lily, identified related genera as Convallaria as Lilium plants at first and assigned Convallaria to the species Lilium without any distinction. Nevertheless lily of the vally wasn't listed by Willem Daems 'Semantische Untersuchungen zum Fachwortschatz hoch- und sp\u00e4tmittelalterlicher Drogenkunde' which emphasizes the importance of Gabriel whom Daems obviously didn't take into consideration like other dialect texts of medical specialist prose. The difficulty of systematical classifying becomes recognizable by determining the blue, white, and yellow described ephemeron of ancient world that Leonhart Fuchs described by the words Lilium convallium about 1500 years later. The discussion about ancient ephemeron in early modern era indicates two lines of traditions, tradition of Strassburg and Basel, unlike line of Strassburg Basel members differenciated between a lethal and non-lethal form following Dioskurides. The illustration of non-lethal form and treating ephemeron as equivalent with Digitalis that you can find in some herbals attests the fact that same effects of Convallaria and Digitalis were recognized. The Ephemerum non venenosum of Dioskurides must be less interpreted as a species of Iris or Polygonatum than a species of convallaria with a digitaloid effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mauch", "ForeName": "Ute", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Das Maigl\u00f6ckchen (Convallaria majalis) Ein Beitrag zur Entwicklung der systematischen Einordnung von der Antike bis zur fr\u00fchen Neuzeit."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Wurzbg Medizinhist Mitt", "NlmUniqueID": "8704998", "ISSNLinking": "0177-5227"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Botany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Classification"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Convallaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 15th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 16th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 17th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Liliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17153307"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
