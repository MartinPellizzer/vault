These effluxes increase transiently in response to an increase in turgor in the effluxing cells. Detached coats of developing seed of P. haseolus vulgaris and Vicia faba were used to study the effects of turgor on the rates of efflux, on the membrane potential difference and on the membrane pH difference, using a number of inhibitors and agents which might affect signal cascades involving cytoplasmic calcium concentration. Effluxes were measured by measuring the concentrations of solutes of interest in solution samples placed in halves of detached seed coats, the paired halves serving as control and treated sample where appropriate. It is shown that a number of substances affect sucrose and potassium effluxes differently, and that hypo-osmotic shock depolarizes the efflux cells and acidifies the cytoplasm (in P. vulgaris). It is concluded that sucrose and potassium effluxes, although both are increased by an increase in turgor, are affected by different signal pathways. Further, it is also concluded that the signal that increases the rates of both sucrose efflux (via sucrose-proton antiport) and proton pump acts directly on the antiporter rather than on the pump. There are interesting parallels and contrasts between these processes and those in plants such as the charophyte Lamprothamnium after hypo-osmotic shock."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics, School of Physics, University of NSW, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia. alanw@mail.usyd.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walker", "ForeName": "N A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "W H", "Initials": "WH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harrington", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holdaway", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Patrick", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Exp Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "9882906", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0957"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proton Pumps"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-50-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Sucrose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RWP5GA015D", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osmotic Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Proton Pumps"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Proton-Motive Force"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sucrose"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10948232", "10.1093/jexbot/51.347.1047"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
