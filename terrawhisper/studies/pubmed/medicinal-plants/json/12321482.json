The plants are genetically engineered to carry genes from disease-causing microbes. Within those microbes, the genes control production of antigens which provoke immune responses in people infected with the microbes. Once inside of a plant's DNA, the genes force the plant to produce the desired vaccinating antigens. While this is far from the first time that foreign genes have been successful spliced into plant DNA, this is the first time that recombinant biotechnology is being used to make plant vaccines for widespread use among humans. Such edible plant vaccines will be less expensive to produce compared to the current production process using microbial fermenters, they can be fitted with a very large number of foreign genes, they can be administered orally, and animal models suggest that they should be able to stimulate the more general antibody and cellular immunity needed for protection against most disease-causing microbes as well as the local immune system of the gut. Plants ideally suited to be vaccine producers and vehicles are tasty, cheap, and can be eaten raw, since heat would inactivate protein antigens. It has recently been shown that foreign genes can be inserted into banana DNA."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["132730", "00275334"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: CVI FORUM"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Delivery Of Health Care", "Economic Factors", "Health", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Plants, Medicinal", "Research And Development", "Technology", "Vaccines"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12321482", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1998", "Month": "08", "Day": "07"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "04"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1021-5182", "JournalIssue": {"Issue": "12", "PubDate": {"Year": "1996", "Month": "Aug"}}, "Title": "CVI forum", "ISOAbbreviation": "CVI Forum"}, "ArticleTitle": "Plant vaccines: edible, but how credible?", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "10", "EndPage": "13", "MedlinePgn": "10-3"}, "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "CVI Forum", "NlmUniqueID": "9417807", "ISSNLinking": "1021-5182"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vaccines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Economics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vaccines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12321482"]}}]}
