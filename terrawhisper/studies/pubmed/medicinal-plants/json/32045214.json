Screening new candidate compounds targeting MPs is important for drug discovery. However, it remains challenging to characterize the interactions between MPs and small-molecule ligands in a label-free method. In this study, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based membrane protein-targeted active ingredients recognition strategy was constructed. This strategy contains two major modules: affinity detection module and ligand screening module. Through the combination of these two functional modules, it is feasible to screen small molecular ligands targeting MPs from herbal medicines. First, we have constructed high/low comparative C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4)-expressed lentiviral particles (LVPs) models and characterized the expression levels. Then we immobilized LVPs on CM5 chips and detected the affinity between AMD3100 and CXCR4 by using affinity detection module. The KD of AMD3100 was 32.48 \u00b1 3.17 nM. Furthermore, the suitability and robustness of the ligand screening module were validated by using AMD3100 as a positive compound. Subsequently, this module was applied in the screening of CXCR4 small molecular ligands from herbal medicine extracts. Senkyunolide I was screened out from <i>Chuanxiong</i> extract. The affinity constant between senkyunolide I and CXCR4 was 2.94 \u00b1 0.36 \u03bcM. The Boyden chamber assay revealed that senkyunolide I could inhibit cell migration process. In conclusion, an SPR-based small molecular ligand recognition strategy combined with virus-based membrane protein stabilization method was constructed. The SPR-based membrane protein-targeted active ingredients recognition strategy will be an effective tool to screen target components from complex systems acting on MPs."]}, "AuthorList":
