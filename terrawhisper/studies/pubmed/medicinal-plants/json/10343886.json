Strategies to prevent or delay onset of symptoms, as well as to prevent the decline into the advanced stage, are urgently needed. While these strategies do not yet exist in a proven and clinically applicable form, the science is progressing rapidly.", "The pre-eminent goal is to identify asymptomatic persons at high risk for AD and to then apply pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions that delay onset of disease. In this scenario, genetic susceptibility testing may eventually prove accurate enough to be of use in identifying at-risk individuals decades before probable onset, allowing maximal preventive efforts. Second, an important goal is to delay or prevent the onset of moderate and advanced AD through applying compounds that slow the progression of disease, thereby allowing patients to die of unrelated ailments of old age before they lose their capacities to recognize loved ones and to communicate by speech.", "This article provides a discussion of these strategies with attention to a variety of ethical issues that should be of concern to physicians and caregivers. An assessment of the scientific evidence for preventing or delaying AD should be coupled with values analysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Biomedical Ethics, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-4976, USA."}], "LastName": "Post", "ForeName": "S G", "Initials": "SG"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "3 RO1 HG01092-02SI", "Acronym": "HG", "Agency": "NHGRI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Am J Prev Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8704773", "ISSNLinking": "0749-3797"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age of Onset"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "genetics", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Progression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Estrogen Replacement Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethics, Medical"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Testing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Priorities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}], "NumberOfReferences": "33"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10343886", "10.1016/s0749-3797(98)00139-1", "S0749379798001391"]}}]}
