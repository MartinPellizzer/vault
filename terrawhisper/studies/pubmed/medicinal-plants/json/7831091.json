Exposure of cercariae to 0.3, 0.6, 1.3, 2.5, 10 or 20 mg/l concentrations of extract for 30 min, immediately before standardized infection, was associated with a concentration-dependent decline in worm establishment at 55 days post-infection. The mean numbers of adult worms established declined from about 17 worms/mouse with control cercariae and those exposed to 0.3 mg/l Millettia to 0.1 worms/mouse after 10 mg/l pre-treatment. Mice exposed to cercariae after 20 mg/l pre-treatment had no adult worms at 55 days post-infection. The activities of cercariae 30 min after exposure to Millettia extract at concentrations up to 2.5 mg/l were similar to those of control larvae: none was immobile. Exposure to higher concentrations of Millettia progressively reduced swimming activity and increased the proportion of immobile cercariae. After pretreatment with 20 mg/l Millettia the majority of larvae were immobile. Levels of anti-parasite antibodies (estimated by ELISA assay using an adult worm-based antigen preparation) rose between 21 and 55 days p.i. with control cercariae and those pre-treated with 2.5 mg/l Millettia. After 5 mg/l pre-treatment, cercariae induced a reduced antibody rise, while mice exposed to cercariae after 10 mg/l pre-treatment showed no rise in anti-parasite antibody levels. These results are discussed in the context of protocols which could possibly use Millettia-attenuated cercariae to induce useful levels of protection in mice towards further cercarial challenge."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Life Sciences, King's College London."}], "LastName": "Perrett", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Whitfield", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bartlett", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sanderson", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Parasitology", "NlmUniqueID": "0401121", "ISSNLinking": "0031-1820"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Helminth"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Molluscacides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Helminth"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Molluscacides"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Schistosoma mansoni"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "parasitology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Schistosomiasis mansoni"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7831091", "10.1017/s0031182000076435"]}}]}
