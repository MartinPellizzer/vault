We examined whether quercetin modulates endothelial function by influencing Ca2+-activated K+ channels with large conductance (BK(Ca)) in cultured human endothelial cells. Membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations of cultured human endothelial cells derived from umbilical cord veins (HUVEC) were measured using the fluorescence dyes DiBAC, and FURA-2, respectively. NO production was examined using a cGMP radioimmunoassay. HUVEC proliferation was analyzed by cell counts and thymidine incorporation. A dose-dependent hyperpolarization of HUVEC was recorded when quercetin was added (5-100 micromol/L). The maximum effect (50 micromol/L) was significantly reduced by the addition of the highly selective BK(Ca) inhibitor iberiotoxin (100 nmol/L), but not by blockers of other Ca2+-activated K+ channels (n = 30; p < 0.05). This BK(Ca)-induced hyperpolarization caused a transmembrane Ca2+ influx, because the quercetin-induced increase of intracellular Ca2+ was blocked by iberiotoxin, or by applying 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (100 micromol/L)--an inhibitor of capacitative Ca2+ entry (n = 30; p < 0.05). Quercetin-induced cGMP levels were significantly reduced by the eNOS-inhibitor l-NMMA (300 micromol/L), and by iberiotoxin (n = 10; p < 0.05). Endothelial proliferation was significantly reduced by 56 % when cells were incubated with quercetin (n = 12; p < 0.05). This effect was due to the increased NO production, because it was reversed when the cells were treated with a combination of quercetin and l-NMMA. In conclusion quercetin improves endothelial dysfunction by increasing NO synthesis involving BK(Ca)-dependent membrane hyperpolarization-induced capacitative Ca 2+ entry. Increased NO production is responsible for the quercetin-dependent inhibition of endothelial proliferation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology and Angiology, Justus-Liebig-University of Giessen, Giessen, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuhlmann", "ForeName": "Christoph R", "Initials": "CR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schaefer", "ForeName": "Christian A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kosok", "ForeName": "Christoph", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abdallah", "ForeName": "Yaser", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walther", "ForeName": "Sabine", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00fcdders", "ForeName": "D\u00f6rte W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neumann", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tillmanns", "ForeName": "Harald", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sch\u00e4fer", "ForeName": "Claudia", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Piper", "ForeName": "Hans M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Erdogan", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Channels, Calcium-Activated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H2D2X058MU", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclic GMP"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclic GMP"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Channels, Calcium-Activated"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15971122", "10.1055/s-2005-864152"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
