There are about 109 species of this genus and 55 species in China. In America, the bulbs were used as food. In Europe, the petals and bulbs of Lilium candidum uesd as pectoral poultices, wound-healing remedy and a treatment for mastitis and shingles, the bulbs of L. martagon were used to treat every liver disease. In India, the bulbs are used medicinally as galactagogue, expectorant, aphrodisiac, diuretic, antipyretic and revitalizing tonic. In Asia, bulbs of this genus are often used to treat coughs, lung diseases, burns and swellings.", "The aim of this work was to summarize traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicity, which provided a theoretical basis for the further study of Lilium plants and their applications in medicine, food and other industries.", "Online scientific databases including Science Direct, American chemical society (ACS), Wiley Online Library, the Web of Science, China national knowledge internet (CNKI) and others were searched to identify eligible studies. More data were obtained from other Chinese medicine books.", "The literature survey revealed diverse traditional uses of the genus Lilium, mainly for the treatment of lung deficiency, hemostasis, anxiety, palpitations, asthma and vomiting. Over 180 compounds have been isolated and identified from the genus Lilium, including steroidal saponins, polysaccharides, phenolic glycerides, flavonoids and alkaloids. Different extracts and monomer compounds were so far evaluated for number of pharmacological activities including anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, immunomodulatory, antidepressant and hepatoprotective activities.", "Lilium spp. are of much significance as ornamental flowers, but also have potential to treat various diseases, especially anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. However, most of the studies on pharmacological effects are still in in vitro, and further studies on mechanism-based pharmacological activities in vivo and in vitro are needed in the future. At present, there are limited researches on its safety and toxicological effects, which should be further explored."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
