Extraction process was designed to evaluate the effects of acid concentrations (0.025, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2\u00a0M HCl) and temperatures (room temperature, 60\u00a0\u00b0C and 80\u00a0\u00b0C) on sensory, structural and immunostimulatory properties of fucoidans and following results on Na<sup>+</sup>-alginates. The amounts of isolated fucoidans (0.193-0.658\u00a0g/5\u00a0g powder) and Na<sup>+</sup>-alginates (2.877-3.383\u00a0g/ 5\u00a0g powder) greatly varied among different extractions. Fucoidans were composed of neutral sugars, mainly fucose (15.74-47.64\u00a0%) and galactose (18.66-26.88\u00a0%) units, with varying amounts of sulfates (8.76-12.40\u00a0%) and uronic acids (0.46-8.90\u00a0%). The weight average molecular weights (M<sub>w</sub>) of fucoidans (234.6-1990.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>3</sup>\u00a0g/mol) and Na<sup>+</sup>-alginates (358.4-2318.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>3</sup>\u00a0g/mol) were closely controlled by extraction condition. Both fucoidan and Na<sup>+</sup>-alginate molecules noticeably induced RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells to exert proinflammatory response, producing considerable levels of NO, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 through NF-\u03baB and MAPKs signaling pathways. Altogether, extraction process of fucoidan not only exerted determining effect on its structure and cell activation capacity, but also influenced the quality of Na<sup>+</sup>-alginate obtained in the next step."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
