ApCPS1 and ApCPS2, the ent-copalyl pyrophosphate (ent-CPP)-producing class II diterpene synthases (diTPSs) were identified, but their contributions to ent-CPP precursor supply for ent-LRD biosynthesis were not well understood. Here, we characterized ApCPS4, an additional ent-CPP-forming diTPS. Further, we elucidated in planta function of the ent-CPP-producing diTPSs (ApCPS1,2,4) by integrating transcript-metabolite co-profiles, biochemical analysis and gene functional characterization. ApCPS1,2,4 localized to the plastids, where diterpenoid biosynthesis occurs in plants, but ApCPS1,2,4 transcript expression patterns and ent-LRD contents revealed a strong correlation of ApCPS2 expression and ent-LRD accumulation in kalmegh. ApCPS1,2,4 upstream sequences differentially activated \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) in Arabidopsis and transiently-transformed kalmegh. Similar to higher expression of ApCPS1 in kalmegh stem, ApCPS1 upstream sequence activated GUS in stem/hypocotyl of Arabidopsis and kalmegh. However, ApCPS2,4 upstream sequences weakly activated GUS expression in Arabidopsis, which was not well correlated with ApCPS2,4 transcript expression in kalmegh tissues. Whereas, ApCPS2,4 upstream sequences could activate GUS expression at a considerable level in kalmegh leaf and roots/calyx, respectively, suggesting the involvement of transcriptional regulator(s) of ApCPS2,4 that might participate in kalmegh-specific diterpenoid pathway. Interestingly, ApCPS2-silenced kalmegh showed a drastic reduction in AD, DDAD and NAD contents and compromised defense against insect herbivore Spodoptera litura. However, ent-LRD contents and herbivore defense in ApCPS1 or ApCPS4-silenced plants remained largely unaltered. Overall, these results suggested an important role of ApCPS2 in producing ent-CPP for medicinal ent-LRD biosynthesis and defense against insect herbivore."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
