It is used in folk medicine to treat various illnesses. It is also used as an antiapoplectic, anticoagulant, anticholagogue, antipneumonic, hematocathartic, and as a hypotensive agent.", "In this review, previous reports on the taxonomy, botanical description, geographic distribution, ethnomedicinal applications, phytochemistry, pharmacological properties, and toxicity of Centaurium erythraea were critically summarized.", "Scientific search engines including PubMed, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Web of Science, Scopus, Wiley Online, SciFinder, and Google Scholar were consulted to collect data on C. erythraea. The data presented in this work summarized the main reports on C. erythraea phytochemical compounds, ethnomedicinal uses, and pharmacological activities.", "C. erythraea is used in traditional medicine to treat various diseases such as diabetes, fever, rhinitis, stomach ailments, urinary tract infections, dyspeptic complaints, loss of appetite, and hemorrhoids, and as diuretic. The essential oils and extracts of C. erythraea exhibited numerous biological properties such as antibacterial, antioxidant, antifungal, antileishmanial, anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, insecticidal, diuretic, gastroprotective, hepatoprotective, dermatoprotective, neuroprotective, and inhibitory agent for larval development. Phytochemical characterization of C. erythraea revealed the presence of several classes of secondary metabolites such as xanthonoids, terpenoids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and fatty acids.", "Ethnomedicinal studies demonstrated the use of C. erythraea for the treatment of various disorders. Pharmacological reports showed that C. erythraea especially its aerial parts and roots exhibited potent, and beneficial activities. These findings confirmed the link between the traditional medicinal use and the results of the scientific biological experiments. Considering these results, further investigation using diverse in vivo pharmacological assays are strongly recommended to validate the results of its traditional use. Toxicological tests and pharmacokinetic studies are also required to validate the safety and efficacy of C. erythraea and its bioactive contents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
