This finding suggested that the hypotensive activity of EOMV may result from its vasodilatory effects directly upon vascular smooth muscle. The present study examines this possibility and whether EOMV-induced hypotension is mediated, at least in part, by an endothelial L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway. In conscious rats, i.v. injections of bolus doses (1 to 20 mg/kg) of EOMV elicited immediate and dose-dependent decreases in mean aortic pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). Pretreatment with i.v. hexamethonium (30 mg/kg) reduced the EOMV-induced bradycardia without affecting the hypotension. However, i.v. pretreatment with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl (L-NAME, 20 mg/kg), reduced partially, but significantly, the maximal percent decreases in MAP elicited by EOMV without affecting the bradycardia. In rat isolated thoracic aorta preparations, EOMV (1 - 130 microg/ml) induced a concentration-dependent reduction of potassium (60 mM)-induced contraction. This smooth muscle-relaxant activity of EOMV was significantly reduced by the incubation of endothelium-intact rings with L-NAME (20 microM), as evidenced by the significant enhancement in the IC50 for EOMV-induced reduction of potassium-induced contraction (133.8 +/- 26.5 vs. 65.2 +/- 8.2 microg/ml in the absence of L-NAME). Furthermore, the vasorelaxant effects of EOMV in endothelium-denuded aortic rings were also significantly reduced (IC50 = 109 +/- 10 microg/ml), compared to those observed in segments with intact endothelium (IC50 = 61 +/- 13 microg/ml). These results show that i.v. treatment with EOMV dose-dependently decreases blood pressure in conscious rats, and that this action is due to an active vascular relaxation rather than withdrawal of sympathetic tone. Released nitric oxide from vascular endothelial cells appears partially involved in the aortic relaxation induced by EOMV and in turn in the mediation of EOMV-induced hypotension. They further support the concept that EOMV-induced hypotension and bradycardia occurred independently."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Fisiologia e Farmacologia, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife-PE, Brasil. lahlou@npd.ufpe.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lahlou", "ForeName": "Saad", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Magalh\u00e3es", "ForeName": "Pedro Jorge Caldas", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carneiro-Le\u00e3o", "ForeName": "Ricardo Ferreira Lima", "Initials": "RF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leal-Cardoso", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 Henrique", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiovascular Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aorta, Thoracic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Consciousness"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelium, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypotension"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mentha"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vasoconstriction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12221590", "10.1055/s-2002-33797"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
