The age of participants ranges from 29 to 64 with mean age of M\u202f\u00b1\u202fSD:51.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.0 years, mostly women (71.4%). Of these, 61.5% were unaware of traditional herbal medicinal products' (THMP) legal recognition and 67.3% of the difference between THMP and well-established use medicines. Absence of accordance between use and knowledge of herbal medicines (HM)/herbal products (HP) (p\u202f=\u202f0.025) can be related to lack of Phytotherapy knowledge perception based on the nonexistence of specific training reported by 94.0% of physicians. Through factor analysis, three dimensions were obtained: Factor1, ``Use''; Factor2, ``Autonomy''; Factor3 ``Effort''. The overall Cronbach's \u03b1 was 0.77, and 0.82 for Factor1. The evidence of use/prescription, has a correlation with ``Use'' (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001), willingness to prescribe (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and self-medication (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). There is a correlation (r\u202f=\u202f0.605, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001) between HS recommendation and self-medication. There were differences in use, perception and attitudes among Personalized-Health-Care Units and Family-Health Units physicians in relation to Factor1: p\u202f=\u202f0.007 and Factor2: p\u202f=\u202f0.021, age (p\u202f=\u202f0.001), years of Medical career (p\u202f=\u202f0.002), HM use (p\u202f=\u202f0.014) and information about alternatives (p\u202f=\u202f0.03).
