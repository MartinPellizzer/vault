To determine the factors influencing rust intensity (maximum disease index [DI<sub>max</sub>]), rust was investigated from 2011 to 2015 in both cultivated and wild A. venetum plants. Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) was used to analyze the paths and extent of the factors related to pathogen, environment, and host that affect rust intensity. DI<sub>max</sub> exhibited considerable variations across years and study sites, with variations linked to various factors fostering disease development. PLS-PM explained 80.0 and 70.1% of variations in DI<sub>max</sub> in cultivated and wild plants, respectively. Precipitation was the key factor determining DI<sub>max</sub> in both cultivated and wild plants (path coefficient [PC] = 0.313 and 0.544, respectively). In addition, the topsoil water content in cultivated plants and the total vegetation coverage in wild plants were also critical determinants of DI<sub>max</sub> via their effects on the microclimatic factor (contribution coefficients [CC] = 0.681 and 0.989, respectively; PC = 0.831 and 0.231, respectively). In both cultivated and wild plants, host factors were mainly dominated by A. venetum density (CC = 0.989 and 0.894, respectively), and their effect on DI<sub>max</sub> via the microclimatic factor (PC = 0.841 and 0.862, respectively) exceeded that via the inoculum factor (PC = 0.705 and 0.130, respectively). However, the indirect effects led to DI<sub>max</sub> variation, while the dilution effect on host (CC = 0.154) from weed in wild plants led to the indirect effect size in wild plants of 0.200, which was lower than -0.699 in cultivated plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2588-3068"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystems, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730020, P.
