This paper reviews the studies on the chemical composition and differences between sea buckthorn berries and leaves. They have the same or similar composition and content of flavonoids,triterpenes,steroids,organic acids and volatile oils,also have some differences. The main differences are as follows: the flavonoids content in the sea buckthorn leaves is greater than that of the sea buckthorn berries,but the species of flavonoids in the berries are higher than leaves. The species and content of steroids and organic acids in the berries are higher than that of the leaves. The berries contain abundant volatile oil,and the leaves contain many phenolic compounds. Finally,the main problems and the prospect of the next research are put forward."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 102488,China Engineering Research Center of Good Agricultural Practice for Chinese Crude Drugs,Ministry of Education Beijing 102488,China."}], "LastName": "Ran", "ForeName": "Bei-Bei", "Initials": "BB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 102488,China Engineering Research Center of Good Agricultural Practice for Chinese Crude Drugs,Ministry of Education Beijing 102488,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wei-Dong", "Initials": "WD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hippophae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31342700", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190222.002"]}}]}
