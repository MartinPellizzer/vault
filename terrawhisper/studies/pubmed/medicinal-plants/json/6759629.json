We measured incorporation of radioactive leucine into insulin and other protein fractions during a 2-h perfusion of rat pancreas, and into insulin during a 3-h incubation of mouse islets. Biosynthesis of insulin during a long-term culture of islets from KK-CAy mice was also measured. DPG-3-2 was found practically not to increase the incorporation into insulin in the pancreatic preparations from animals with normoglycemia, but in such preparations from animals with hyperglycemia DPG-3-2 (0.2-1.0 mg/ml) caused 1.5-1.8-fold incorporation into insulin. In addition, a long-term treatment of DPG-3-2 (0.5 mg/ml) was shown to stimulate insulin biosynthesis in islets from KK-CAy mice. Ginsenoside-Rb1 and -Rg1 decreased the insulin content of islet to the undetectable level. Thus, DPG-3-2 was shown to stimulate insulin biosynthesis in different preparations of pancreas from animals with hyperglycemia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Waki", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kyo", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yasuda", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kimura", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Pharmacobiodyn", "NlmUniqueID": "7901854", "ISSNLinking": "0386-846X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GMW67QNF9C", "NameOfSubstance": "Leucine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Islets of Langerhans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Leucine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pancreas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6759629", "10.1248/bpb1978.5.547"]}}]}
