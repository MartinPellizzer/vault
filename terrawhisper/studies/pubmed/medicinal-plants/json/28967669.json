Two CYP716A subfamily cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP716A252 and CYP716A253) are identified from a methyl jasmonate-responsive expression sequence tag collection and functionally characterized, employing yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) expression platform and adapting virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in sweet basil. CYP716A252 and CYP716A253 catalyzed sequential three-step oxidation at the C-28 position of \u03b1-amyrin and \u03b2-amyrin to produce ursolic acid and oleanolic acid, respectively. Although CYP716A253 was more efficient than CYP716A252 for amyrin C-28 oxidation in yeast, VIGS revealed essential roles for both of these CYP716As in constitutive biosynthesis of ursolic acid and oleanolic acid in sweet basil leaves. However, CYP716A253 played a major role in elicitor-induced biosynthesis of ursolic acid and oleanolic acid. Overall, the results suggest similar as well as distinct roles of CYP716A252 and CYP716A253 for the spatio-temporal biosynthesis of PCTs. CYP716A252 and CYP716A253 might be useful for the alternative and sustainable production of PCTs in microbial host, besides increasing plant metabolite content through genetic modification."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 The Authors.
