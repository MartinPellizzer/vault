Herein, we reported the fabrication and surface properties investigation of a new highly sensitive electrochemical sensor for the detection of cynarin. The electrochemical sensors were fabricated in several steps; the first being the synthesis of bi-thiophene derivatives-based monomers 3,3'-bithiophen (M1); 2-methoxy-5-carbaldehyde-[3,3'-bithiophene] (M2) and 2-((2-methoxy-[3,3'-bithiophen]-5-yl)methylene)malononitrile) (M3) followed by electrochemical polymerization on a glassy carbon electrode after which multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and gold nanoparticles (GNP's) were electrodeposited layer-by-layer on the polymer coating to obtain multilayer electrochemical sensors. The morphological properties of the formed polymers were evaluated using SEM analysis and the apparent contact angles to preview the changes in surface properties after the functionalization of monomers and therefore their effects on the detection of cynarin. Analytical parameters such as the accumulation time and pH of the PBS solution which influence the sensitivity of the electrochemical sensors were optimized. Under the optimal conditions the GCE/P3/MWCNT/GNP's showed a wide range of analyte concentrations (1 to 100\u00a0\u03bcM and 0.01 to 1\u00a0\u03bcM) and detection limit of 0.0095 using pulse differential voltammetry. In addition, the electrochemical sensors showed good reproducibility, stability and selectivity and they were used successfully for the determination of cynarin in real solutions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
