Subsequently, the pharmacological activities, including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-microbial, anti-obesity, have been discussed. The pharmacokinetics data and toxicity profile of acacetin are also discussed.", "Acacetin is a potent molecule reported for its strong anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activity, however further scientific evidence is essential to validate its potency in disease models associated with inflammation and cancer. There is limited information available for toxicity profiling of acacetin; therefore, further studies would aid in establishing this natural flavone as a potent candidate for research studies at clinical setup."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
