In addition, the effect of \"TU Youyou\" will not only improve the industry development, but also indicates the increasing international competition intensely. Therefore, one of the core problems of the sustainable-development industry is the training of senior talents under the \"New Situation\" with opportunity and intense competition. As one of the forefront courses of Chinese Pharmacology, Molecular Pharmacognosy (MP) is a new interdisciplinary science, which integrates the pharmacognosy and molecular biology, and combines many discipline theories and technological systems. MP not only inherits the traditional concepts,but also makes up for the shortages of pharmacognosy, and improves the development of pharmacognosy. Thus, these are importance of MP for cultivation of senior talents, and also the difficult teaching points of MP with no unified teaching mode. We will, in this paper, discuss the possible teaching modes through several aspects for talent cultivation and meeting the needs of social and industry development, such as teaching state of MP, the education of undergraduate and graduate students, social identity, and self renewal of curriculum theories and practice."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Secondary Metabolism and Regulation of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Science, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Wan-Li", "Initials": "WL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Secondary Metabolism and Regulation of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Science, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Zhe-Chen", "Initials": "ZC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Secondary Metabolism and Regulation of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Science, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Dan", "Initials": "XD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Secondary Metabolism and Regulation of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Science, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, China."}], "LastName": "Sheng", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Secondary Metabolism and Regulation of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Science, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Zong-Suo", "Initials": "ZS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["education"], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Biology"}, {"QualifierName": ["education"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacognosy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Teaching"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28948724", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20161222.010"]}}]}
