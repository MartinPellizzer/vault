A few studies have investigated the effects of color additives of cosmetic products on human fibroblasts. Therefore, this in vitro study was conducted to investigate the effects of 9\u00a0synthetic and natural dyes (indigo carmine, carmine, sunset yellow, tropaeolin, acid green 25, chlorophyllin, tartrazine, lissamine, and amaranth) on human foreskin fibroblast cells.", "MTT assay was applied to investigate the effects of dyes on human normal fibroblast cells. For investigating the possible mechanism of cytotoxicity, the effect of dyes was evaluated on parameters of cellular oxidative stress including lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as lactate dehydrogenase.", "In the MTT assay, a significant reduction (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) was observed in the viability of fibroblast cells by chlorophyllin and indigo carmine at concentrations higher than 10 and 100 (\u03bcg/ml), respectively. Acid green 25 caused a significant reduction at very high concentrations (1000 and 2000\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), which was not toxic. The effect of other investigated dyes was not significant on the fibroblasts. A trend in increased cell proliferation by amaranth and carmine was observed, but this enhancement was not statistically significant. No significant changes were observed in lipid peroxidation or lactate dehydrogenase. Chlorophyllin caused a significant increase in the production of cellular ROS.", "Indigo carmine and chlorophyllin had cytotoxicity on human fibroblasts, and thus, further studies are required on their safety of use in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Processing Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Pasdaran", "ForeName": "Ardalan", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Transplant Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Azarpira", "ForeName": "Negar", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Heidari", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student research committee, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nourinejad", "ForeName": "Simin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zare", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6021-6730"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Processing Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hamedi", "ForeName": "Azadeh", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "97-01-70-18758", "Agency": "Shiraz University of Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Cosmet Dermatol", "NlmUniqueID": "101130964", "ISSNLinking": "1473-2130"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthraquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyllides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4403-90-1", "NameOfSubstance": "D & C green 5"}, {"RegistryNumber": "915-67-3", "NameOfSubstance": "Amaranth Dye"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CID8Z8N95N", "NameOfSubstance": "Carmine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D3741U8K7L", "NameOfSubstance": "Indigo Carmine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactate Dehydrogenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EEM82VOY7C", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorophyllin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I753WB2F1M", "NameOfSubstance": "Tartrazine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amaranth Dye"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anthraquinones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carmine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyllides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Foreskin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indigo Carmine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lactate Dehydrogenases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tartrazine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Guerra E, Llompart M, Garcia-Jares C.
