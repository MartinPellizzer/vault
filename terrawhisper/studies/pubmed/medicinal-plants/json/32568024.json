Healthy skin promotes a healthy body that can be achieved with the usage of modern, allopathic and natural remedies. Major skin ailments affecting humans are skin cancers, eczema, herpes infection, fungal infection, anti-aging, itching, insect bites, pemphigus vulgaris, trauma, psoriasis, athlete's foot infections, rashes, skin pigmentation, acne, major and minor wound infections that are slowly becoming a burden on health care. Skin infections can be treated from sources that originate from animals and plants. In spite of advancements in science and technology, the emergence of natural herbal remedies for managing skin disorders has become a pivotal and essential contributor in treating skin infections due to increased demand for herbals and their lower price, and continuous adverse effects of modern medicines. In the recent era, herbal extracts and their phytomedicines have made a vital contribution to human health care. Herbal products nowadays are considered as a single line of treatment for many diseases like Cancers, Diabetes, Cardiovascular and Brain disorders, thereby creating awareness regarding purity, efficacy and safety of herbal medicines for health care management. Many therapeutically active natural herbal resources like Aloe, Neem, Liquorice, Tulsi, Amla, Papaya, Ginger and Eucalyptus are potent and safe in the treatment of dermatological infections. This review article summarizes the significance of herbal plants for protecting, treating and minimizing skin infections through the utility of herbal pharmaceuticals like creams, decocted extracts, poultice, paste and lotions that aid in the treatment of skin infections and diseases at a relatively lower cost with lesser side effects as compared to modern and allopathic medicines."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, GLA University, Mathura-281406, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Ahuja", "ForeName": "Ashima", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, GLA University, Mathura-281406, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Jitendra", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, GLA University, Mathura-281406, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Reena", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Infect Disord Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "101269158", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5265"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32568024", "10.2174/1871526520666200622142710", "IDDT-EPUB-107567"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
