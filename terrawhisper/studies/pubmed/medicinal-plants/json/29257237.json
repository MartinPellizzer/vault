Samchuleum (SCE) is a traditional herbal mixture that is recorded in the ancient Korean medical book, Donguibogam. The present study attempted to determine whether SCE treatment was able to improve high glucose (HG)\u2011induced mesangial cell fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis in primary cultured human mesangial cells. Thymidine incorporation under HG induction was increased, but was decreased by SCE in a dose dependent manner. Pretreatment with SCE led to a downregulation in the expression of cyclins and cyclin\u2011dependent kinases (CDKs), and an upregulation of the CDK inhibitors, p21waf1/cip1 and p27kip1. In addition, SCE exposure markedly suppressed the reactive oxygen species signaling pathway under HG conditions. HG enhanced the expression levels of \ufb01brosis\u2011promoting mediators, including collagen\u00a0IV and connective tissue growth factor, which were markedly attenuated by SCE. SCE treatment inhibited HG\u2011induced fibronectin mRNA expression and decreased the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)\u2011\u03b21, Smad\u20112 and Smad\u20114, whereas Smad\u20117 expression increased under HG. SCE treatment induced the degradation of the extracellular matrix by blocking TGF\u2011\u03b21/Smad signaling. Therefore, the present study suggested that the inhibitory effect of SCE on mesangial proliferation and renal fibrosis may be an effective therapy in the treatment of renal dysfunction leading to DN."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Oriental Medicine and Professional Graduate School of Oriental Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 540\u2011749, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Jung Joo", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Oriental Medicine and Professional Graduate School of Oriental Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 540\u2011749, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Yun Jung", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Oriental Medicine and Professional Graduate School of Oriental Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 540\u2011749, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Namgung", "ForeName": "Seung", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Oriental Medicine and Professional Graduate School of Oriental Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 540\u2011749, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Byung Hyuk", "Initials": "BH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Oriental Medicine and Professional Graduate School of Oriental Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 540\u2011749, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Eun Sik", "Initials": "ES"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Oriental Medicine and Professional Graduate School of Oriental Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 540\u2011749, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Dae Gill", "Initials": "DG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Oriental Medicine and Professional Graduate School of Oriental Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 540\u2011749, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Ho Sub", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Mol Med Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "101475259", "ISSNLinking": "1791-2997"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smad Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transforming Growth Factor beta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "samchuleum"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Nephropathies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mesangial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Smad Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transforming Growth Factor beta"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29257237", "10.3892/mmr.2017.8201"]}}]}
