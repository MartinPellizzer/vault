The coupling of plant extracts that have anticancer and antibacterial properties with NiO nanoparticles has increased their usage in the biomedical field. In this work, we report on the novel synthesis of NiO nanoparticles using a local medicinal plant, Monsonia burkenea. The nickel nanoparticles were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). FTIR showed that the extraction of the plant phytochemicals was successful and the green synthesized nanoparticles from plants contained the phytochemical groups that are found in the Monsonia burkeana plant. XRD and HRTEM confirmed the successful formation of NiO nanoparticles with an average particle size range of 20\u202fnm. These results were also corroborated by elemental mapping and EDX, where the dominant groups were identified.The Monsonia burkeana NiO particles exhibited selective bactericidal activity against Gram-negative strains, such as E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Additionally, cytotoxicity studies showed the materials did not have any anti proliferative effect against A549 lung cancer cells but could be used as potential drug delivery vehicles against human cancers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
