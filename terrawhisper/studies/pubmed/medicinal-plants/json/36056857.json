Approximately 10% to 15% of all persons above the age of 60 have some degree of OA. OA is more common in women than in males. Diagnosed OA prevalence varies widely among EU member states, from 2.8% in Romania to 18.3% in Hungary.", "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a slow-progressing, non-inflammatory disorder. This disorder ultimately destroys articular cartilage and other joint components. The main symptoms are stiffness, pain, loss of flexibility, swelling, and bone spurs. Many modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors have been associated with osteoarthritis (OA), including obesity and lack of exercise, genetic susceptibility, bone density, work-related damage, and trauma.", "Hydrogels, micro and nano-sized particles, and novel topical gels are the most common examples. Hydrogels are cross-linked polymers with 3-D architecture that can hold water and expand like living tissue. The micro-carriers and nano-based drug delivery systems provide several advantages and may demonstrate prolonged release, controlled release, and higher joint half-life.", "OA-induced male Lewis rats were injected with celecoxib-loaded PEA microspheres to assess in vivo biocompatibility and degradation. According to the findings of this research, PEA microspheres loaded with celecoxib may be employed as safe delivery of drugs with self-regulating behavior for pain treatment related to knee osteoarthritis.", "The concept of novel drug delivery systems has shown tangible benefits as a new avenue for precise, safe, high-quality drug delivery for OA treatment. Currently, herbal drugs are also used in osteoarthritis treatment due to their potency and fewer side effects than synthetic drugs. The herbosynthetic approach is a new concept for the delivery of both herbal and synthetic drugs together to exploit their individual beneficial effects while reducing undesirable side effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technology, Maharaja Ranjit Singh Punjab Technical University (MRSPTU), Bathinda, 151001, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Mohit", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Padova, via Marzolo 1, 35131 Padova, Italy."}], "LastName": "Dogra", "ForeName": "Raghav", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technology, Maharaja Ranjit Singh Punjab Technical University (MRSPTU), Bathinda, 151001, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Mandal", "ForeName": "Uttam Kumar", "Initials": "UK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Deliv", "NlmUniqueID": "101208455", "ISSNLinking": "1567-2018"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "JCX84Q7J1L", "NameOfSubstance": "Celecoxib"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogels"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Celecoxib"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Lew"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoarthritis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogels"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "44"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36056857", "10.2174/1567201819666220901092832", "CDD-EPUB-126066"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
