However, analysis of bioactivity for tissue culture developed plant tissues is required to offer support and allow acceptance in traditional medicine. The use of propagated callus could provide potential material for therapeutic purposes. This study was aimed at evaluating the anti-HIV and antibacterial properties of a three-month-old tissue culture-derived calli and leaves of cultivated mother plants of Catha edulis Forsk. The calli were derived from leaf explants using different plant growth regulators. The calli obtained from callus cultured on 9.8\u2009\u03bcM indole-3-butyric acid plus 2.7\u2009\u03bcM naphthalene acetic acid exhibited the highest HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory effects when compared with other treatments and the mother plants. Different extracts of callus exhibited high antibacterial activity (<1\u2009mg/mL: minimum inhibitory concentration from 0.098 to 0.78\u2009mg/mL) against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Leaf acetone extracts showed moderate activity (minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.78\u2009mg/mL) against Staphylococcus aureus. The present study indicated that tissue culture-derived calli could be used as therapeutic agents for traditional medicine. The choice of treatment used in the tissue culture system and the age of the callus for production of biomass may significantly influence its therapeutic potential."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Plant Growth and Development, School of Life Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, Private Bag X01, Scottsville, 3209, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Kumari", "ForeName": "Aloka", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Plant Growth and Development, School of Life Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, Private Bag X01, Scottsville, 3209, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Baskaran", "ForeName": "Ponnusamy", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Plant Growth and Development, School of Life Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, Private Bag X01, Scottsville, 3209, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Van Staden", "ForeName": "Johannes", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-HIV Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "061SKE27JP", "NameOfSubstance": "indolebutyric acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.7.-", "NameOfSubstance": "reverse transcriptase, Human immunodeficiency virus 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.7.49", "NameOfSubstance": "HIV Reverse Transcriptase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-HIV Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Catha"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "HIV Reverse Transcriptase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "11", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25753483", "10.1002/ptr.5318"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
