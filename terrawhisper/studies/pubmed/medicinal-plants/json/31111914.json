However, it is still largely unknown how epigenetic mechanisms are associated with the expression of salt-responsive genes in rice and other crops. In this study, we reported tissue-specific gene expression and tissue-specific changes in chromatin modifications or signatures between seedlings and roots in response to salt treatment. Our study indicated that among six of individual mark examined (H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H4K12ac, H3K9ac, H3K27ac and H3K36me3), a positive association between salt-related changes in histone marks and the expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was observed only for H3K9ac and H4K12ac in seedlings and H3K36me3 in roots. In contrast, chromatin states (CSs) with combinations of six histone modification marks played crucial roles in the differential expression of salt-responsive genes between seedlings and roots. Most importantly, CS7 containing the bivalent marks H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, with a mutual exclusion of functions with each other, displayed distinct functions in the expression of DEGs in both tissues. Specifically, H3K27me3 in CS7 mainly suppressed the expression of DEGs in roots, while H3K4me3 affected the expression of down- and up-regulated genes, possibly by antagonizing the repressive role of H3K27me3 in seedlings. Our findings indicate distinct impacts of the CSs on the differential expression of salt-responsive genes between seedlings and roots in rice, which provides an important background for understanding chromatin-based epigenetic mechanisms that might confer salt tolerance in plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd The Author(s) 2019.
