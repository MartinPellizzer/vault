Medicinal plants are widely used as home remedies in Brazil but several species used are native of other continents and were introduced here since the colonization, beginning in 1500. The Traditional Medicine Division of the WHO recognizes the importance of plant species used by the Amerindian as medicines, and recommends that their efficacies should be evaluated through pharmacological and toxicological assays.", "To verify which Brazilian medicinal plants, especially those of Amerindian origin, were used in 19th century and have been evaluated by pharmacological studies.", "Data about the use of native plants in traditional medicine were searched in bibliographic material from European naturalists who traveled throughout Minas Gerais in the 19th century.", "Two hundred and three species were described as useful by these naturalists and thirty-nine of them were also included in the first edition of Brazilian Official Pharmacopoeia (FBRAS) in 1929, showing their use also in conventional medicine. Seventeen species have medicinal properties of Amerindian origin but despite the long tradition of medicinal plant use, only nine have been evaluated by pharmacological studies. That the studies which have been conducted to date have in each case confirmed the traditional uses of the plants examined. We suggest that the remaining species must be regarded as a priority for pharmacological studies, as they have promising phytotherapeutic potential."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "DATAPLAMT - Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Minas Gerais, Brazil. mbrandao@ufmg.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brand\u00e3o", "ForeName": "Maria G L", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zanetti", "ForeName": "Naiara N S", "Initials": "NN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oliveira", "ForeName": "Patricia", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grael", "ForeName": "Cristiane F F", "Initials": "CF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Santos", "ForeName": "Aparecida C P", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Monte-M\u00f3r", "ForeName": "Roberto L M", "Initials": "RL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indians, South American"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacopoeias as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "history", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18762237", "10.1016/j.jep.2008.08.004", "S0378-8741(08)00424-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
