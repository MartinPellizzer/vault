This plant contains the toxic compound namely L-mimosine. The main mechanism of action of this compound involves its ability to chelate metal ions, which may interfere with the proliferative activity of cells and being studied for the treatment of cancer. However, little is known about the effect of L-mimosine on immune responses. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of L-mimosine on immune responses in Wistar rats. Different doses of L-mimosine (25, 40 and 60\u00a0mg/kg body weight/day) were administered orally by gavage to adult rats for 28 days. No clinical signs of toxicity were observed in animals, but a decrease in the T-dependent response to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) in animals treated with 60\u00a0mg/kg L-mimosine and an increase in the intensity of S. aureus phagocytosis by macrophages in animals treated with 40 or 60\u00a0mg/kg L-mimosine were observed. Therefore, these findings suggest that L-mimosine did not compromise macrophage activity and inhibited T-dependent clonal expansion during the immune response."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
