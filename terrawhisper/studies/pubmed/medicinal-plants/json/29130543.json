These herbs have been long valued and studied for detumescence, detoxification, and insecticidal effect. This review aims to provide comprehensive information on botanical, phytochemical, pharmacological, and toxicological studies on plants in the genus Macleaya. Plants from the genus of Macleaya provide a source of bioactive compounds, primarily alkaloids, with remarkable diversity and complex architectures, thereby having attracted attention from researchers. To date, 291 constituents have been identified and/or isolated from this group. These purified compounds and/or crude extract possess antitumor, anti-inflammatory, insecticidal, and antibacterial activities in addition to certain potential toxicities. Macleaya species hold potential for medicinal applications. However, despite the pharmacological studies on these plants, the mechanisms underlying the biological activities of active ingredients derived from Macleaya have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. Additionally, there is a need for research focusing on in vivo medical effects of Macleaya compounds and, eventually, for clinical trials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National and Local Union Engineering Research Center for the Veterinary Herbal Medicine Resources and Initiative, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National and Local Union Engineering Research Center for the Veterinary Herbal Medicine Resources and Initiative, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yan-Chun", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National and Local Union Engineering Research Center for the Veterinary Herbal Medicine Resources and Initiative, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jia-Lu", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Co-Innovation Center for Utilization of Botanical Functional Ingredients, College of Veterinary Medicine, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiu-Bin", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Co-Innovation Center for Utilization of Botanical Functional Ingredients, College of Veterinary Medicine, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China."}], "LastName": "Qing", "ForeName": "Zhi-Xing", "Initials": "ZX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National and Local Union Engineering Research Center for the Veterinary Herbal Medicine Resources and Initiative, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Co-Innovation Center for Utilization of Botanical Functional Ingredients, College of Veterinary Medicine, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Jian-Guo", "Initials": "JG"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9050-2287"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National and Local Union Engineering Research Center for the Veterinary Herbal Medicine Resources and Initiative, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Co-Innovation Center for Utilization of Botanical Functional Ingredients, College of Veterinary Medicine, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Engineering Research Center of Veterinary Drug, College of Veterinary Medicine, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhao-Ying", "Initials": "ZY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29130543", "10.1002/ptr.5952"]}}]}
