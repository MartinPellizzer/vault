Different parts of plants that help in their identification include root, fruit, bark, stem but leaf images have been widely used as they are an abundant source of information and are also easily available. This work explores the branch of Artificial Intelligence, called deep learning, and proposes an Ensemble learning approach to rapidly detect medicinal plants using the leaf image. The medicinal leaf dataset consists of 30 classes. Transfer learning approach was used to initialize the parameters and pre-train Neural networks namely MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and ResNet50. These component models were used to extract features from the input images and the softmax layer connected to the Dense Layer was used as the classifier to train the models on the concerned dataset. The obtained accuracies were validated using threefold and fivefold cross-validation. The Ensemble Deep Learning- Automatic Medicinal Leaf Identification (EDL-AMLI) classifier based on the weighted average of the component model outputs was used as the final classifier. It was observed that the EDL-AMLI outperformed the state-of-the-art pre-trained models such as MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and ResNet50 by achieving 99.66% accuracy on the test set and average accuracy of 99.9% using threefold and fivefold cross validation."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management 2022, Springer Nature or its licensor holds exclusive rights to this article under a publishing agreement with the author(s) or other rightsholder(s); author self-archiving of the accepted manuscript version of this article is solely governed by the terms of such publishing agreement and applicable law."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0786-0527"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.261674.0", "0000 0001 2174 5640"], "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Applications, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India."}], "LastName": "Sachar", "ForeName": "Silky", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.261674.0", "0000 0001 2174 5640"], "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Applications, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Anuj", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Int J Inf Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "101765254", "ISSNLinking": "2511-2104"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Parekh J, Chanda S.
