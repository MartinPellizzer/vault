Somatic embryos developed from the roots of an in vitro seedling and from excised leaf and petiole segments cultured in half-macro-salt strength Murashige and Skoog medium. Excised leaf and petiole segments were obtained from in vitro germinated seedlings. Plantlets were subsequently obtained from developing somatic embryos in phytohormone-free media. Shoot formation from somatic embryos was influenced by light intensity. The rate of growth and frequency of embryogenesis were improved when cut-up embryogenic tissues were inoculated into liquid media in the dark. The ginsenoside contents of a 4 year-old field-cultivated root, seedlings from zygotic embryos, somatic embryos and embryogenic tissues were determined and compared. Somatic embryos contained 1.7 times the amount of ginsenoside Rb1 and 2.3 times the amount of ginsenoside Re compared to seedlings from zygotic embryos. Ginsenoside Rd, which was absent in the seedlings derived from zygotic embryos, was detected in somatic embryos. Higher ginsenosides Rd and Rg1 levels were found in embryogenic tissues grown on solid media than in tissues grown in liquid media. The total ginsenoside yields, including the ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg1 levels, of cut-up embryogenic tissues, were higher than those of clump tissues."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Process & Biotechnology, Singapore Polytechnic, Singapore."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shu", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoshimatsu", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamaguchi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shimomura", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Kokuritsu Iyakuhin Shokuhin Eisei Kenkyusho Hokoku", "NlmUniqueID": "9807834", "ISSNLinking": "1343-4292"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["embryology", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10859948"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
