Cheese powder was added to black gram flour at 0-50% levels and papads were prepared in the conventional manner by rolling the dough and drying. These papads were deep-fat fried at 180 degrees C. Upto 20% addition of cheese powder gave no perceptible change in taste or flavour of the mini-papads. At 30% addition brown colouration was observed which decreased the sensory appeal. At 40 and 50% levels, although the mouthfeel and flavour of cheese was desirable, browning increased markedly, which drastically lowered the overall acceptability. Ascorbic acid addition at 0.5-1.0% markedly decreased the browning. The papads had a higher fat content on frying as compared to the control but were excellent organoleptically, suggesting them to be a tasty and crunchy snack food."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Technology, University of Mumbai, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Srinivasan", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Annapure", "ForeName": "U S", "Initials": "US"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sahoo", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singhal", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kulkarni", "ForeName": "P R", "Initials": "PR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "9432922", "ISSNLinking": "0963-7486"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cheese"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Consumer Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maillard Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10945113", "10.1080/09637480050029674"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
