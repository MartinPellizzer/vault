Other WIC foods, including cheese, peanut butter, dried beans, and hot and cold cereals, were consumed infrequently (0 to 1 time/month). Subjects reported that with the availability of WIC vouchers, milk, eggs, and juice remained frequently consumed with 81% to 100% of monthly supply as the most prevalent reported consumption rate. Dried beans and hot and cold cereals were also consumed frequently. Cheese remained poorly consumed (0% to 20% of the monthly supply). As many as 74 of 80 subjects stated that they had shared foods from their own WIC package, except milk, with their families. The use of any WIC foods provided to other children in the family was not assessed in this study.", "Data from this study indicate that most WIC foods were well used by Chinese prenatal patients. The most notable exception was cheese, which was poorly consumed. The ready consumption of milk by pregnant Chinese WIC recipients in this study suggests that milk may be readily consumed by these women, even though it is atypical of the Asian diet. The WIC food package for Chinese prenatal patients may be improved by omitting cheese and substituting more milk and/or foods such as tofu and dark green leafy vegetables."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition, Finch University of Health Sciences, Chicago Medical School, North Chicago, Ill., USA."}], "LastName": "Horswill", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yap", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Diet Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503061", "ISSNLinking": "0002-8223"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "California"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cheese"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Counseling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cultural Characteristics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eggs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interviews as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poverty"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prenatal Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Yin-Yang"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10608949", "10.1016/S0002-8223(99)00379-X", "S0002-8223(99)00379-X"]}}]}
