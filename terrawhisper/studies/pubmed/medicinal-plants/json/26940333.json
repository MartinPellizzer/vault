In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of celery seed extract on different biochemical factors and histopathological changes in normal and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.", "A total of 35 male Wistar rats were divided into five groups (one normal and four diabetic groups). STZ was injected intraperitoneally to induce diabetes. The effects of hexane extract of celery seed and glibenclamide (as a positive control) were compared. Blood samples were analyzed on days 0, 18, and 33, and histopathological evaluations were performed at the end of the study.", "Glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels significantly decreased, whereas insulin and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels increased in the extract-administered groups, as compared to the negative diabetic control group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in serum of the extract-administered groups were significantly less than the negative control group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Histopathological reports revealed significantly less atrophy, necrosis, and inflammation in the rats receiving celery seed extract compared to the negative control group.", "The results indicated that celery seed extract can be effective in controlling hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in diabetic rats, and demonstrated its protective effects against pancreatic toxicity resulting from STZ-induction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee (SRC), Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tashakori-Sabzevar", "ForeName": "Faezeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee (SRC), Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ramezani", "ForeName": "Masoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseinzadeh", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry of Nutrition Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Parizadeh", "ForeName": "Seyyed Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathobiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Movassaghi", "ForeName": "Ahmad Reza", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. mohajeria@mums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Mohajeri", "ForeName": "Seyed Ahmad", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Acta Diabetol", "NlmUniqueID": "9200299", "ISSNLinking": "0940-5429"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SX6K58TVWC", "NameOfSubstance": "Glyburide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apium"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Glyburide"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperglycemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pancreas"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26940333", "10.1007/s00592-016-0842-4", "10.1007/s00592-016-0842-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
