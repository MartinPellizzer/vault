Its antihypertensive activity was therefore investigated in normotensive and spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) after both oral and intravenous (i.v.) administration. The activity was compared with that of captopril (D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline), a potent ACE inhibitor. Oral administration of Areca II-5-C to SHR produced a lasting, dose-related antihypertensive effect, and the responses obtained with doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg were comparable to those of captopril at doses of 30 and 100 mg/kg. Intravenous administration of Areca II-5-C to SHR produced a rapid and marked reduction in blood pressure at doses of 10 and 15 mg/kg. The maximum antihypertensive effect of Areca II-5-C in SHR, at an i.v. dose of 15 mg/kg, was about 5 times as large as that of captopril at the same dose. Although the vasopressor response to norepinephrine and vasodepressor responses to bradykinin and acetylcholine were not appreciably changed by i.v. treatment with Areca II-5-C at a dose of 5 mg/kg, it did produce dose-related inhibition of the pressor responses to angiotensin I and II. It is suggested that Areca II-5-C has favorable properties as a hypotensive drug through its ability to inhibit the pressor responses to both angiotensin I and II."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Inokuchi", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Okabe", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamauchi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nagamatsu", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nonaka", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nishioka", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375521", "ISSNLinking": "0024-3205"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Angiotensins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9G64RSX1XD", "NameOfSubstance": "Captopril"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S8TIM42R2W", "NameOfSubstance": "Bradykinin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Angiotensins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Bradykinin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Captopril"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred SHR"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred WKY"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "4", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3007909", "10.1016/0024-3205(86)90470-4", "0024-3205(86)90470-4"]}}]}
