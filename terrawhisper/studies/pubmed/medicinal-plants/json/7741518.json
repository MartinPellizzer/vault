However, 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-8-methoxyflavone (F36) from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis significantly reduced this single-cycle replication of A/PR8 from 4 h to 12 h after incubation by dose-dependent manner and the dose which decrease the virus titer one tenth was 11 microM. F36 (50 microM) did not inhibit the adsorption of A/PR8 to MDCK cells, but reduced release of the virus in the medium, when it was added at 0 or 2 h after the incubation. The cell-associated virus determined by sialidase activity was also reduced by F36 treatment at 0 or 2 h. F36 also inhibited the fusion of A/PR8 with liposomes containing bovine brain mixed gangliosides at pH 5.0. However, F36 little affected on the elongation activity of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in vitro. These results suggest that F36 reduces the replication of A/PR8 by inhibiting the fusion of the virus with endosome/lysosome membrane which occurs at early stage of virus infection cycle. Whereas, when F36 was added to the MDCK cells infected with A/PR8 at 3 or 4 h after incubation, release of the virus in the medium was reduced but the cell-associated virus was increased in comparison with control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oriental Medicine Research Center, Kitasato Institute, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Nagai", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Moriguchi", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Suzuki", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tomimori", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Antiviral Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8109699", "ISSNLinking": "0166-3542"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57096-02-3", "NameOfSubstance": "5,7,4'-trihydroxy-8-methoxyflavone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuraminidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescent Antibody Technique"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Influenza A virus"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Neuraminidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Orthomyxoviridae Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Viral Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Replication"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7741518", "10.1016/0166-3542(94)00062-d", "016635429400062D"]}}]}
