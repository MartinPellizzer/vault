Glycosidases were screened in germinating seeds, and attempts were made to enhance their levels. Screening of glycosidases in the seedlings during a 72 h germination period revealed higher levels of beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase in Trigonella foenum-graecum compared to Cicer arietinum and Vigna radiata. Activity of beta-galactosidase was in general higher than that of beta-glucosidase in all the seedlings tested. During growth, exposure of the seedlings to an allelochemical, mimosine, at 0.1 mM resulted in the enhancement of enzyme levels by 50% in the seedlings of T. foenum-graecum, whereas the addition of mimosine to the assay medium in vitro did not affect the enzyme activities. Hydrolytic activity was enhanced by addition of glycerol in the medium up to 0.1 M in the case of beta-glucosidase and with 0.05 M in the case of beta-galactosidase. In general, the hydrolytic rate was higher by about 30% in the seedlings exposed to mimosine compared to that of the control. Concomitant enhancement in the rates of transgalactosidation by 51% and transglucosidation by 23% was also noted, underscoring the relevance of plant glycohydrolases for appropriate applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India."}], "LastName": "Santosh", "ForeName": "T R", "Initials": "TR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Balasubramanian", "ForeName": "K K", "Initials": "KK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lalitha", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "500-44-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Mimosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.21", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-Glucosidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.23", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-Galactosidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Mimosine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stimulation, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "beta-Galactosidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "beta-Glucosidase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10563917", "10.1021/jf980352d", "jf980352d"]}}]}
