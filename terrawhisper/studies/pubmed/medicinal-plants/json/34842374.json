Cup-plate method was used and then the inhibition zone of each plant was measured and compared with the inhibitory zone of some antibiotics used for the same isolates. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Methanol extracts of some plant species showed antibacterial activity against most of the studied bacterial species. &lt;i&gt;Cymbopogon schoenanthus &lt;/i&gt;ssp.&lt;i&gt; Proximus &lt;/i&gt;showed antibacterial activity against most isolated bacterial species in comparison with commercial antibiotics used. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; According to the findings of this research, severalmedicinal plants have efficacy and effect on certain types of bacteria and are superior or comparable to certain types of antibiotics.
