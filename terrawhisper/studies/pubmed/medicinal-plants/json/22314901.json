(HB) is used in the treatment of painful conditions and oedema amongst its folkloric use. The hexane and ethyl acetate fractions of the root of H. barteri were investigated for anti-nociceptive and antiinflammatory properties and probable mechanism of action. Hot plate, tail flick, formalin-induced oedema and acetic acidinduced writhing tests were employed to investigate the anti-nociceptive activity while the anti-inflammatory activity was investigated using carrageenan-induced paw oedema. Anti-histaminic potential of HB root extracts on the rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMCs) was explored through pectrofluorometric method. The root was screened for its phytochemical components. The HB root contains alkaloids,cardenolides and saponins. HXHBR exhibited higher anti-inflammatory potentials (P <0.001). HXHBR dose-dependently (P <0.01) reduced the histamine release from the rat peritoneal mast cells which is comparable with a standard anti-histaminic drug, ketotifen. These results showed that EAHBR and HXHBR possess anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities, and suggested its mechanism of action through the inhibition of histamine, an inflammatory mediator, usually released during the early phase of allergic responses and chronic phase of inflammatory pain. Flavonoids, alkaloids and/or saponins present in HB root may be responsible for its anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria. sa.onasanwo@mail.ui.edu.ng"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Onasanwo", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "G D", "Initials": "GD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olaleye", "ForeName": "S B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johri", "ForeName": "R K", "Initials": "RK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Nigeria", "MedlineTA": "Niger J Physiol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8811109", "ISSNLinking": "0794-859X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Histamine Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apocynaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rodentia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22314901"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
