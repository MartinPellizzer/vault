The efficacy improvement in medicinal plants is mainly caused by changes in the key substances through an optimized processing procedure. Thus, the use of a rapid method for determining suitable chemical markers between raw and processed TCM is critical in order to elucidate how the bioactive compounds influence the clinical effects. In this study, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry combined with MS/MS-based molecular networking (MN) and a multivariate statistical analysis method is proposed for the first time. This combination was used to identify the complex chemical composition and clarify the changed constituents between raw and processed Cistanche tubulosa (C. tubulosa). The chemical analysis results demonstrated that a total of 85 compounds were identified in the crude and processed C. tubulosa. Moreover, 34 compounds were detected as chemical markers. This systematic research into chemical constituents and chemical markers of crude and processed C. tubulosa lays a solid foundation for further study of the quality control of C. tubulosa. Moreover, the study provides a new and valuable technical strategy for analyzing chemical components and identifying potential chemical markers for the processing of herbal medicines.Graphical abstract."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Interdisciplinary Medical Sciences, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 1200 Cai-Lun Road, Shanghai, 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Huibo", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Interdisciplinary Medical Sciences, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 1200 Cai-Lun Road, Shanghai, 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yuhao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Zu", "ForeName": "Xianpeng", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangyuyuan Chinese Medicine Co., Ltd., Taigu, 030800, Shanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Yanlin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China. chengtaofanglm@163.com."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Taofang", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Interdisciplinary Medical Sciences, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 1200 Cai-Lun Road, Shanghai, 201203, China. wdzhangy@hotmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China. wdzhangy@hotmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China. wdzhangy@hotmail.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Weidong", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Anal Bioanal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101134327", "ISSNLinking": "1618-2642"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cistanche"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Iridoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lignans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Guo P, Brand E, Zhao ZZ.
