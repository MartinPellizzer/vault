An orthogonal array design (OAD), OA(9)(3(4)), was employed as a chemometric method for the optimization of the supercritical fluid extraction of baicalin from the herbal medicine. Four parameters, namely, modifiers, temperature and pressure of supercritical fluid, and the dynamic extraction time, were studied and optimized by a three-level OAD in which the interactions between the parameters were neglected. Determinations of the extracts were performed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The effects of parameters were studied using analysis of variance. The results showed that selection of the modifier was the main factor in attaining higher yields of baicalin. While the other three factors had some effect on the extraction of the compound, the effect was much less than that of the modifiers. 1,2-Propanediol-modified supercritical fluid was more effective than 95% ethanol-modified supercritical carbon dioxide or methanol-modified supercritical carbon dioxide for the extraction of baicalin from the solid matrix. Finally, experimental conditions were proposed which can provide the highest extraction yield with respect to the considered factors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Zhejiang Pharmaceutical College, Ningbo, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Yiling", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ben", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Sep Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101088554", "ISSNLinking": "1615-9306"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "347Q89U4M5", "NameOfSubstance": "baicalin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Supercritical Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Scutellaria baicalensis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17623438", "10.1002/jssc.200700020"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
