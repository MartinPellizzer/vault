In this paper, we aimed to investigate the effect of Shatavarin IV (SIV), a steroidal saponin isolated from Asparagus racemosus Willd. on dietary restriction (DR) induced longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. SIV significantly increased the lifespan to 18% which is independent of antimicrobial activity and reduced the aging by-product, lipofuscin along with increased locomotion, and chemotaxis behavior in wild type worms. The longevity effect has been dependent on eat-2, which was further validated via reduced pharyngeal pumping rate that established the effect similar to DR induced longevity. Moreover, like eat-2 mutant worms, SIV reduces the total progeny number of wild type worm along with a significant alleviation of stored fat, which reconfirms the involvement of eat-2 mediated longevity. Further, it was also observed that DR induced longevity mechanism by SIV requires mTOR which works in PHA-4/FOXA dependent manner. In addition to this, the role of autophagy mechanism concerning SIV mediated DR was confirmed via bec-1, unc-51, and lgg-1. The longevity effect achieved by SIV was also dependent on SKN-1/NRF-2 and partially dependent on DAF-16/FOXO. Furthermore, the DR-induced longevity by SIV was found to be independent of hsf-1 exhibiting non-significant alteration in the mRNA expression of downstream target genes hsp-16.2 and hsp-70. Altogether, this study provides first-hand information on the pro-longevity effect of SIV in worms that have been mediated by the DR-regulating gene induced autophagy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Technology and Nematology, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Near Kukrail Picnic Spot, Lucknow, 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Smita", "ForeName": "Shachi Shuchi", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Technology and Nematology, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Near Kukrail Picnic Spot, Lucknow, 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Trivedi", "ForeName": "Shalini", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Technology and Nematology, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Near Kukrail Picnic Spot, Lucknow, 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Pandey", "ForeName": "Taruna", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Technology and Nematology, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Near Kukrail Picnic Spot, Lucknow, 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Trivedi", "ForeName": "Mashu", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0947-4272"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Technology and Nematology, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Near Kukrail Picnic Spot, Lucknow, 226015, India. r.pandeycimap@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Pandey", "ForeName": "Rakesh", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biogerontology", "NlmUniqueID": "100930043", "ISSNLinking": "1389-5729"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Asparagus Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Autophagy"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Caenorhabditis elegans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Longevity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "20"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32888154", "10.1007/s10522-020-09897-5", "10.1007/s10522-020-09897-5"]}}]}
