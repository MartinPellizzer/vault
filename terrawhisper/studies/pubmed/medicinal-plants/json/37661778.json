Its association with the tumor suppressor protein p53 is essential for controlling the growth of cells, apoptosis, and response to DNA damage. By raising p53 acetylation, encouraging apoptosis, and reducing cell proliferation, inhibiting SIRT1's catalytic domain, which interacts with p53, shows potential as a cancer treatment. The aim of the study is to find compounds that could inhibit SIRT1 and thus lower the proliferation of cancer cells. Employing molecular docking techniques, a virtual screening of \u223c900 compounds (isolated from medicinal plants and derivatives) gave us 13 active compounds with good binding affinity. Additional evaluation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties led to the selection of eight compounds with desirable properties. Docking analysis confirmed stable interactions between the final eight compounds (<b>C1-C8</b>) and the SIRT1 catalytic domain. Molecular dynamics simulations show overall stability and moderate changes in protein structure upon compound binding. The compactness of the protein indicated the protein's tight packing upon the inhibitors binding. Binding free energy calculations revealed that compounds <b>C2</b> (-49.96\u2009\u00b1\u20090.073\u2009kcal/mol and <b>C1</b> (-44.79\u2009\u00b1\u20090.077\u2009kcal/mol) exhibited the highest energy, indicating strong binding affinity to the SIRT1 catalytic domain. These compounds, along with <b>C8, C5, C6, C3, C4</b> and <b>C7</b>, showed promising potential as SIRT1 inhibitors. Based on their ability to reduce SIRT1 activity and increase apoptosis, the eight chemicals discovered in this work may be useful in treating cancer.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
