Among the reported ginsenosides, ginsenoside Rg_1 not only has a wide range of medicinal functions and abundant content but also is one of the major ginsenoside for the quality evaluation of this herb in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. The main biosynthesis pathway of ginsenoside Rg_1 in P. ginseng has been clarified, which lays a foundation for the comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the biosynthesis and regulatory mechanism of ginseno-side Rg_1. However, the biosynthesis of ginsenoside Rg_1 is associated with other complex processes involving a variety of regulatory genes and catalyzing enzyme genes, which remain to be studied comprehensively. With the transcriptome data of 344 root samples from 4-year-old P. ginseng plants and their corresponding ginsenoside Rg_1 content obtained in the previous study, this study screened out 217 differentially expressed genes(DEGs) with Rg_1 content changes by DEseq2 analysis in R language. Furthermore, the weighted gene co-expression network analysis(WGCNA) revealed 40 hub genes among the DEGs.Pearsoncorrelation analysis was further perforned to yield 20 candidate genes significantly correlated with ginsenoside Rg_1 content, and these genes were annotated to multiple metabolic processes including primary metabolism and secondary metabolism. Finally, the treatment of P. ginseng adventitious roots with methyl jasmonate indicated that 16 of these genes promoted the biosynthesis of ginsenoside Rg_1 in response to methyl jasmonate induction. Finally, one of the 16 genes was randomly selected to verify the function of the gene by genetic transformation and qRT-PCR and to confirm the rationality of the methodology of this study. The above results lay a foundation for studying the mechanism for regulation on the synthesis of ginsenoside Rg_1 and provide genetic resources for the industrial production of ginsenoside Rg_1."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Jilin Agricultural University Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Rui-Cen", "Initials": "RC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Jilin Agricultural University Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Jilin Agricultural University Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chao-Fan", "Initials": "CF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Jilin Agricultural University Changchun 130118, China Jilin Agricultural University,Research Center for Ginseng Genetic Resources Development and Utilization,Jilin Province Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Jilin Agricultural University Changchun 130118, China Jilin Agricultural University,Research Center for Ginseng Genetic Resources Development and Utilization,Jilin Province Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Mei-Ping", "Initials": "MP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PJ788634QY", "NameOfSubstance": "ginsenoside Rg1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39041119", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20240413.101"]}}]}
