It encodes the tumor suppressor protein p53, which suppresses tumorigenesis by acting as a critical transcription factor that can induce the expression of many genes controlling a plethora of fundamental cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, survival, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Missense mutations are the most frequent type of mutations in the TP53 gene. While these can have variable effects, they typically impair p53 function in a dominant-negative manner, thereby altering intra-cellular signaling pathways and promoting cancer development. Additionally, it is becoming increasingly apparent that p53 mutations also have non-cell autonomous effects that influence the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME is a complex and heterogeneous milieu composed of both malignant and non-malignant cells, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), adipocytes, pericytes, different immune cell types, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and T and B lymphocytes, as well as lymphatic and blood vessels and extracellular matrix (ECM). Recently, a large body of evidence has demonstrated that various types of p53 mutations directly affect TME. They fine-tune the inflammatory TME and cell fate reprogramming, which affect cancer progression. Notably, re-educating the p53 signaling pathway in the TME may be an effective therapeutic strategy in combating cancer. Therefore, it is timely to here review the recent advances in our understanding of how TP53 mutations impact the fate of cancer cells by reshaping the TME."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
