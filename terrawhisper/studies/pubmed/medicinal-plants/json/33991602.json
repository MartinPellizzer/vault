The resolution of enantiomers was performed with chiral HPLC. Their structures were characterized by extensive spectroscopic data analysis and calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD). A hypothetical biosynthetic pathway for 1 is proposed. Biological assay revealed that (-)-2 showed moderate antiviral effect against IAV with IC<sub>50</sub> value of 6.3\u00a0\u03bcM, and (\u00b1)-2 displayed cytotoxic activities against five human tumor cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 15.5 to 42.5\u00a0\u03bcM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
