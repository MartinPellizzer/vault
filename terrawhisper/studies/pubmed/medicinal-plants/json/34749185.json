For the first time, the C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>5</sub> was used as fiber coating of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) to extract and preconcentrate polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) before gas chromatography (GC) analysis. The X-ray diffraction, N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were performed to investigate structure, functional groups, thermal stability, bonding type, element composition, and atomic ratio of C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>5</sub>. The two-dimensional planar stacking structure was further verified by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Five PCBs including PCB-4, PCB-12, PCB-29, PCB-52 and PCB-101 were selected as targets to evaluate performance of SPME fiber. Under the optimal conditions, the method showed a good linear range from 0.01 to 1000\u00a0ng/mL with the correlation coefficients (R<sup>2</sup>) higher than 0.9990. Enrichment factors of the method were obtained from 2045 to 3080. The limits of detection (LODs, S/N\u00a0=\u00a03) and limits of quantification (LOQs, S/N\u00a0=\u00a010) were calculated as 0.0031-0.0111\u00a0ng/mL and 0.01-0.05\u00a0ng/mL, respectively. The precisions of intra-day and inter-day were obtained with the relative standard deviations (RSDs) at 1.5-6.6% and 0.8-6.9%, respectively. The fiber-to-fiber producibility was achieved with RSDs ranged from 3.5% to 11.4%. The method was applied to detect PCBs in river water and soil samples. The contents were calculated at 0.040-0.147\u00a0ng/mL in water and 0.520-3.218\u00a0ng/g in soil. The C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>5</sub> as SPME fiber coating material may be applied to extract and preconcentrate other environmental pollutants which have similar chemical structures with PCBs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
