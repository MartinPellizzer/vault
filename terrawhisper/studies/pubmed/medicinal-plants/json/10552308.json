Three consecutive pollen seasons of Artemisia occurring each year, related to three different species (A. campestris, A. herba-alba and A. barrelieri), were observed. A winter blooming of Artemisia could explain the incidence of subsequent pollinosis in the Murcia area. With regard to meteorological parameters, mathematical analyses showed relationships between daily pollen concentrations of Artemisia in summer-autumn and precipitations that occurred 6-8 weeks before. The cumulative percentage of insolation from 1 March seemed to be related to blooming onsets. Once pollination has begun, meteorological factors do not seem to influence pollen concentrations significantly. Intradiurnal patterns of pollen concentrations were similar for late summer and winter species (A. campestris and A. barrelieri). During autumn blooming (A. herba-alba), the intradiurnal pattern was particularly erratic. Theoretical values of wind run were obtained for each pollen season by the graphical sum of hourly wind vectors. When theoretical wind run was mapped onto the vegetation pattern, supposed pollen source locations were obtained for each hour. By comparing supposed hourly pollen origins with the intradiurnal patterns of pollen concentrations, it can be seen that this simple model explains variations in mean pollen concentrations throughout the day."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Biolog\u00eda Vegetal (Bot\u00e1nica), Facultad de Biolog\u00eda, E-30100 Espinardo, Murcia, Spain. mmunuera@fcu.um.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Munuera Giner", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carri\u00f3n Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda Sell\u00e9s", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Biometeorol", "NlmUniqueID": "0374716", "ISSNLinking": "0020-7128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wind"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10552308", "10.1007/s004840050116", "90430051.484"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
