This is an original drug developed by the company, and consists of 14 exotic natural medicines, spikenard, oriental bezoar, musk, agarwood, etc. It has been used for adjusting the autonomic nervous system and physical conditions. We studied the original methods of the traditional quality management techniques handed down within INUBUSHI SEIYAKU in selecting the appropriate spikenard (Nardostachys chinensis) for medicinal use. Currently, spikenards are mainly used as incense rather than medicine. KEISHIN-TAN is a rare case in that the bulk powder of the spikenards is used for pharmaceutical products in Japan. We examined the morphological characteristics and made an analysis of the component of spikenards selected by traditional methods. The raw material of the spikenards was purchased from the Japanese market, and was classified into two categories-superior, fit for medicinal use and defective, to be discarded-by traditional methods of INUBUSHI SEIYAKU. The methods of the characterization of the spikenard by INUBUSHI SEIYAKU were investigated. As a result, only thick spikenard roots over 2.0 cm in length and approximately 0.5 cm in diameter were found to be used, and the total weight of the superior was only 15% of the raw material. By comparing the weights of hexane extracts and GC-MS analyses, the content of calarene--main sedative compound in spikenards--in the superior material was 2.8 times higher than the raw material and 4.3 times higher than the defective material. The ways to devise how to enhance the pharmacological effects of spikenards may be contained in this method. These results revealed the traditional spikenard selection criteria, and may show the indications of using spikenard or its compounds for medicinal purposes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ito", "ForeName": "Ken", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Inubushi", "ForeName": "Soichiro", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Moriwaki", "ForeName": "Takafumi", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsunaga", "ForeName": "Kazuhiro", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "Kyoko", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ueda", "ForeName": "Takahiro", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hashizume", "ForeName": "Setsuya", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Takemoto", "ForeName": "Hiroaki", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kobayashi", "ForeName": "Yoshinori", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ota", "ForeName": "Tomoe", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nakamura", "ForeName": "Seiko", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsuda", "ForeName": "Hisashi", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakushigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "1267223", "ISSNLinking": "0285-2314"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26427103"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
