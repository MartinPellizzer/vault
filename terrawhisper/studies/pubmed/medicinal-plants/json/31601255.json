However, its involvement in ovarian carcinoma (OC) is unknown. In the present study, we analyzed the roles of AB209371 in OC. We found that AB209371 gene and Survivin gene were up-regulated in OC and positively correlated with OC development. AB209371 over-expression led to up-regulated Survivin in OC cells, while Survivin over-expression failed to affect AB209371. In addition, AB209371 over-expression led to down-regulated miR-203. However, miR-203 over-expression failed to affect AB209371, but down-regulated the expression of Survivin. In addition, over-expressions of AB209371 and Survivin resulted in the increased proliferation rate of OC cells. Over-expression MiR-203 played the opposite role and attenuated the effects of AB209371 over-expression. Therefore, AB209371 may down-regulate miR-203 to up-regulate Survivin, thereby promoting OC cell proliferation. Our study provided novel insights into the pathogenesis of OC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Cultivation Base For TCM Quality and Efficacy, School of Medicine and Life Sciences, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Zi-Hui", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Biotechnology on Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Science;
