However, only a few MYB and bHLH members involved in the biosynthesis of salvianolic acid B (Sal B) have been reported, and little is known about Sal B pathway regulation by the WD40 protein transparent testa glabra 1 (TTG1)-dependent transcriptional complexes in Salvia miltiorrhiza. We isolated SmTTG1 from that species for detailed functional characterization. Enhanced or reduced expression of SmTTG1 was achieved by gain- or loss-of-function assays, respectively, revealing that SmTTG1 is necessary for Sal B biosynthesis. Interaction partners of the SmTTG1 protein were screened by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays with the cDNA library of S. miltiorrhiza. A new R2R3-MYB transcription factor, SmMYB111, was found through this screening. Transgenic plants overexpressing or showing reduced expression of SmMYB111 upregulated or deregulated, respectively, the yields of Sal B. Both Y2H and bimolecular fluorescent complementation experiments demonstrated that SmMYB111 interacts with SmTTG1 and SmbHLH51, a positive regulator of the phenolic acid pathway. Our data verified the function of SmTTG1 and SmMYB111 in regulating phenolic acid biosynthesis in S. miltiorrhiza. Furthermore, ours is the first report of the potential ternary transcription complex SmTTG1-SmMYB111-SmbHLH51, which is involved in the production of Sal B in that species."]}, "AuthorList":
