People of rural areas of Pakistan are prone to snakebite, and on the whole death due to snakebite has been increasing worldwide. The objective of this study was to test the neutralizing potential of 17 Pakistani medicinal plant extracts against phospholipase A2 activity in Echis carinatus venom. Plant material was extracted by simple maceration and fractionation of active plant extracts. Venom was collected by manual massage of the venom glands. The PLA2 enzymatic assay was performed to map out the venomous activity of Echis carinatus envenomation. Snake venom released fatty acids at different concentrations (0.1-5 mg/ml) of venom in a dose-dependent manner. Reduction of pH by 01 correlated with 133 \u03bcmol of fatty acids released at 5mg/ml of venom. All plants extract inhibited PLA2 activity, however, Curcuma longa, Citrullus colocynthis and Rubia cordifolia inhibited maximum of PLA2 activity (\u205378%) comparable to the standard antidote (p>0.5). Medicinal plants possess secondary metabolites and many active compounds that may have neutralizing or inhibiting properties against the PLA2 activity of Echis venom. Further studies such as compound analysis could provide an alternative against snakebites injuries resulting from Echis carinatus venom."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
