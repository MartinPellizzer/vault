The pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, efficacy, side effects and drug interactions of St. John's wort have been examined in various studies.", "St. John's wort is a promising investigational antidepressant, but the data are not yet sufficient to accept hypericum as a first line antidepressant preparation for treatment of depression. Besides the need for dose standardization and adequate trial lengths, there is a need for studies in severely depressed patients and long-term studies to assess the risk of relapse and recurrence."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nangia", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Syed", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Doraiswamy", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Public Health Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "9808463", "ISSNLinking": "1368-9800"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depressive Disorder, Major"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "MEDLINE"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Safety"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}], "NumberOfReferences": "52"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11276296", "10.1017/s1368980000000562", "S1368980000000562"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
