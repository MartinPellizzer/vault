Eight crude polysaccharides were isolated from the dried leaves by successive extraction with 85% ethanol (FE), 0.9% sodium chloride (FS), hot water (FI), 1% ammonium oxalate (FII), 5% NaOH (FIII-a, FIII-b) and 20% NaOH (FIV-a, FIV-b). They were decolorized by hydrogen peroxide treatment and the protein was removed with Savag's method. The polysaccharides were precipitated by three volumes of absolute ethanol. After further purification by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephadex G-200 column, these polysaccharides were lyophilized. Their physicochemical properties and structural feature were elucidated by modern analytical technique such as UV, elemental analysis and high performance gel permeation chromatography. From the results of partial hydrolysis, FE and FIII-b have a main chain comprised solely of glucuronic acid and xylose residues, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China. chenchy@lnat.ihepa.ac.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elmahadi", "ForeName": "E A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10191937", "10.1002/(SICI)1099-0801(199902)13:1<11::AID-BMC764>3.0.CO;2-V", "10.1002/(SICI)1099-0801(199902)13:1<11::AID-BMC764>3.0.CO;2-V"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
