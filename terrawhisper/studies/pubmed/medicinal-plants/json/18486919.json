However, the purified Corilagin that was used in experiment is rare, and the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Corilagin has not been investigated clearly. This study is to explore the inner anti-inflammatory mechanism of Corilagin. Inflammatory cellular model was established by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interfering on RAW264.7 cell line. Levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, NO and IL-10 in supernatant, mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, COX-2, iNOS and HO-1, protein expression of COX-2 and HO-1, translocation of NF-kappaB were assayed by ELISA or Griess method, real-time quantitative PCR, western blot and immunocytochemistry method, respectively. As a result, Corilagin could significantly reduce production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, NO (iNOS) and COX-2 on both protein and gene level by blocking NF-kappaB nuclear translocation. Meanwhile Corilagin could notably promote release of anti-inflammatory factor HO-1 on both protein and gene level, but suppress the release of IL-10. In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory effects of Corilagin are attributed to the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators by blocking NF-kappaB activation. Corilagin also can promote HO-1 production to induce regression of inflammation but can inhibit IL-10 production like Dexamethasone. Corilagin possesses a potential anti-inflammatory effect by not only abating inflammatory impairment but also promoting regression of inflammation and has a good prospect to be used in many inflammation-related diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hepatology & Infectious Disease, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shu-Ling", "Initials": "SL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Jun-Yan", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pang", "ForeName": "Ran", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Yuan-Jin", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Ji-Hua", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Pian", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Hong-Yang", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Guo-Hua", "Initials": "GH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Int Immunopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "100965259", "ISSNLinking": "1567-5769"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "62LOS9TW6D", "NameOfSubstance": "corilagin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Heme Oxygenase-1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Active Transport, Cell Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Heme Oxygenase-1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18486919", "10.1016/j.intimp.2008.03.003", "S1567-5769(08)00084-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
