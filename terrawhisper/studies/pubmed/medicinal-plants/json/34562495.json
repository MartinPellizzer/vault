To determine the highest active fraction and isolate bioactive compounds, a bioassay guided fractionation approach was used. The general toxicity properties of the plant's extracts and fractions (fr<sub>1-10</sub>) were assessed against Artemia salina, Oryzeaphilus mercator, and Tribolium castaneum. Cytotoxic activities were investigated against normal human foreskin fibroblasts and two malignant cell lines, including human breast cancer (MCF-7) and human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080) using the MTT assay at different time points of 24, 48, and 72\u00a0h. Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and mass spectrometry data were used to determine the structure of the active guaianolide sesquiterpene lactone (3aR,4S,4aS,5R,7aS,9aS)-5-hydroxy-5,8-dimethyl-3-methylene-2-oxo-2,3,3a,4,4a,5,6,7,7a, 9a decahydroazuleno [6,5-b] furan-4-yl acetate (named aryanin). Chloroformic fraction 7 (fr<sub>7</sub>, LC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a093.50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL for general toxicity) had the highest toxicity result, with a mortality rate of more than 50% for both insect species after 12\u00a0h at 15\u00a0mg/mL. The highest cytotoxicity of aryanin was observed on 24\u00a0h treated MCF-7 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 13.81\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. After 24\u00a0h, the inhibition of MCF-7\u00a0cell proliferation was 92%-94% at concentrations of 25-50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively. On MCF-7, the IC<sub>50</sub> was found to be 49.35\u00a0\u03bcg/mL after 72\u00a0h. This compound had a considerable cytotoxicity (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0\u2264\u00a012.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, 24\u00a0h) on human foreskin fibroblasts. In contrast to the MCF-7\u00a0cell line, the proliferation of human foreskin fibroblasts was increased after 72\u00a0h."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
