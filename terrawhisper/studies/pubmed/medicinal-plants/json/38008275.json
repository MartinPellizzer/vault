Published books, thesis, scientific and medical articles on C. nigrescens, P. africana and P. macrocarpa were collected from the following databases: 'Scopus', 'Science Direct', 'Medline', 'PubMed', 'Research Gate' 'Google Scholar, and 'Springer link' using the keywords.", "Phytochemical analysis of C. nigrescens, P. africana and P. macrocarpa revealed the presence of some prominent bioactive compounds such as convallatoxin, 7,3,4-trihydroxy-3-methoxyflavanone and dioxane, respectively. Plant extracts and isolated compounds of these medicinal plants exhibited a wide range of ethnopharmacological activities including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic, cytotoxic, antimalarial, antipyretic, haematinic, hepato-protective, aphrodisiac and antihypertensive properties.", "The present review on C. nigrescens , P.africana and P. macrocarpa provided a credible summary of the ethnopharmacological research conducted on these medicinal plants till date. The data also highligted the potential therapeutic profiles of these plants in Ghana that could serve as foundation for future studies.
