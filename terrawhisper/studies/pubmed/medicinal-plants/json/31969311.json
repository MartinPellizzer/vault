Some of its strains are able to cross the species barrier and cause infection in various members of class Mammalia. In view of relatively lesser efficacy of vaccines, antiviral therapies remain the only choice for the sustenance of mammals acquiring this highly devastating infection. This study is based on the evaluation of antiviral potential of methanol extracts of eleven selected Cholistani plants. The methanol extracts were prepared by using dried plants material followed by concentrating in a rotary evaporator and finally air dried before dissolving in nanopure water. The suspension was filter sterilized and subjected to in ovo antiviral assays. The allantoic fluids were harvested and haemagglutinin (HA) titers were determined. Among the eleven plants evaluated all methanol extracts were found effective against AIV H9N2 except S. baryosma extract. The medicinal plants O. compressa, N. procumbens, and S. surattense were found to be more effective than others and they retained HA titers at 0 after challenge. The next in order were extracts of O. esculentum, H. salicornicum and S. fruticosa which kept HA titers at 4, 8 and 16 respectively. The extracts of H. recurvum, P. antidotale, S. icolados and A. aspera were found less effective than above mentioned plant extracts and they kept the HA titers at 32, 64, 128 and 256 respectively. These results led us to conclude that the medicinal plants of Cholistan region are a rich source of antiviral agent(s) against AIV H9N2 and could be a source of cost effective alternate therapeutics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry & Biotechnology, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shahzad", "ForeName": "Mirza Imran", "Initials": "MI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Govt Sadiq College Women University, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ashraf", "ForeName": "Hina", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Aslam", "ForeName": "Amna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Parveen", "ForeName": "Sabeeha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Kamran", "ForeName": "Zahid", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Naz", "ForeName": "Nargis", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Jhang, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Arshad", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, The Islamic International University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khalid", "ForeName": "Sumbul", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Industrial Sciences & Technology, Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Lebuhraya Tun Razak 26300 Gambang, Pahang Darul Makmur, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Mukhtar", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemagglutination Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Influenza in Birds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Poultry Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31969311"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
