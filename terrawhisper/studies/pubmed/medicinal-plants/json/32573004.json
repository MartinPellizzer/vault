In the current work, the effect of seed priming with SMF (45, 90, 200, and 250\u2009mT for 5\u2009min) was investigated in 60-day-old hyssop (H. officinalis) plants that were irrigated every 8 days. The assessments consisted of total dry mass, membrane integrity, photosynthetic pigment concentrations, polyphenol content, antioxidant enzyme activities, and antioxidant capacity. Compared with exclusively water stress, magnetopriming, particularly at 200\u2009mT, significantly altered these parameters in the grown plants. At this intensity, the level of total dry mass, total chlorophyll, and polyphenol content increased by 94%, 2.5- and 7.7-fold, respectively. Also, the level of electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde decreased by 35% and 33%. The reducing power, DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrozyl), and superoxide anion-scavenging activities were highly augmented as well. Magnetopriming at 200\u2009mT increased catalase (+92%) and ascorbate peroxidase (+2.3-fold) activities. However, the highest activity of guaiacol peroxidase was recorded at 90\u2009mT. Generally, the present study illustrated the positive effect of magnetopriming (200\u2009mT) on improvement of drought tolerance in H. officinalis through protection of cellular membrane integrity, maintenance of photosynthetic pigment content, and alternation of antioxidant enzyme activities. Furthermore, the data showed this treatment (200\u2009mT) not only had no negative effect on medicinal properties of H. officinalis, but also improved it via increasing total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity.
