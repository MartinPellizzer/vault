Patients were given intensive phase treatment with 4-drugs (rifampicin, INH, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) used for anti-tubercular therapy for 2 months, followed by a 4-month continuous phase treatment with 2 drugs (rifampicin and INH) under clinical advice and supervision. Both qualitative and quantitative measures of liver function were assessed, at different time intervals, before and after ATT. Analysis of data showed that the incidence of qualitative manifestations of liver dysfunction were greater in the placebo treated group as compared to the test drug group. None of the patients of either group showed clinical jaundice. Most signific changes ant were observed in the SGOT and SGPT levels in the placebo group, wherein the levels of both enzymes were higher at 4 and 8 weeks post-ATT, as compared to the respective baseline (0 week) values. When Livina (2 capsules twice daily) was given with ATT drugs, incidence of qualitative manifestation of liver dysfunction was insignificant and SGOT and SGPT levels were also significantly lower than the placebo+AITT drugs treated group. These results indicate that the test drug (Livina) was efficacious, against ATT-induced hepatic dysfunction in patients of pulmonary tuberculosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Research Centre, Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, University of Delhi, Delhi 10 007, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gulati", "ForeName": "Kavita", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ray", "ForeName": "Arunabha", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vijayan", "ForeName": "V K", "Initials": "VK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Livina"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2KNI5N06TI", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrazinamide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8G167061QZ", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethambutol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VJT6J7R4TR", "NameOfSubstance": "Rifampin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ethambutol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrazinamide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Rifampin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Single-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21046988"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
