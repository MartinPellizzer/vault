At adulthood, after diabetes status confirmation, the rats were mated and randomized into four experimental groups: Nondiabetic (Control): given water; Treated: given C. americana extract; Diabetic, and Treated Diabetic rats. The aqueous extract of C. americana leaves (300\u00a0mg/kg) was administered daily through oral route during pregnancy. Maternal toxicity and biochemical profile, reproductive outcomes, fetal development, and phenolic composition and biogenic amines in aqueous extract were analyzed.", "Phytochemical analysis revealed that the main phenolic components are 3-hydroxytyrosol, kaempferol, and quercetin, while tryptophan and putrescine derivatives were identified as the dominant amines. C. americana extract treatment improved the lipid profile, although no effect on hyperglycemic control in diabetic rats was observed. Maternal diabetes or C. americana extract caused embryo losses confirmed by the lower number of pre-embryos in early pregnancy and higher percentage of abnormal morphologically pre-embryos. C. americana extract previously caused premature pre-embryo fixation before implantation window in nondiabetic and diabetic mothers and intrauterine growth restriction in the fetuses of treated nondiabetic dams, complicating the embryo fetal development. These findings reinforce the caution of indiscriminate use of medicinal plants, especially during pregnancy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
