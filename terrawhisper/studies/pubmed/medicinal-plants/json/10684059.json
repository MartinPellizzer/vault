By the one-stage method, after the cell suspensions were cultured on the same medium for six weeks, the increased dry and fresh weights of the cells were 20.96 g/L and 174.92 g/L respectively. The content of the total alkaloids in the cells was 14.79 mg/g cell dw. Per litter liquid medium could provide 323 mg alkaloid. In contrast, the cells were cultured by two-stage method. After having been cultured on the medium which contributed to the growth of the cells for three weeks, the cells were transferred to the medium which contributed to the production of the alkaloid and cultured for three weeks. Six weeks later, the dry and fresh weights of the cells were 16.72 g/L and 127.44 g/L, respectively. The biomass was lower than that by one-stage method, but the content of the total alkaloids was as high as 31.76 mg/g cell dw, which was much more than that by one-stage method. In addition, the content of the alkaloid in the medium was 25.31 mg/L. Per litter liquid medium could provide 556 mg alkaloid. The total yield of alkaloid obtained by two-stage method was 1.72 times than that by one-stage method."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Chengdu."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chao", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhuang", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Hua Xi Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "8609552", "ISSNLinking": "0257-7712"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10684059"]}}]}
