Its manipulation affects processes primarily governed by ABA. It negatively regulates ABA responses in tomato by altering ABA levels/signaling and is, in turn, negatively regulated by ABA. SlDREB3 over-expression lines show higher transcript levels of the ABA metabolism genes CYP707A3 and UGT75C1 and an 85% reduction in ABA levels leading to early seed germination. In contrast, suppression lines show decreased CYP707A3/UGT75C1 expression, 3-fold higher ABA levels and delayed germination. The expression of other ABA signaling and response genes is also affected. Suppression of SlDREB3 accelerates the onset of ripening by 4-5 days while its over-expression delays it and also reduces final fruit size. SlDREB3 manipulation effects large scale changes in the fruit transcriptome with suppression lines showing early increase in ABA levels and activation of most ripening pathway genes that govern ethylene, carotenoids and softening. Strikingly, key transcription factors like CNR, NOR, RIN, FUL1, governing ethylene-dependent and ethylene-independent aspects of ripening, are activated early upon SlDREB3 suppression suggesting their control by ABA. The studies identify SlDREB3 as a negative regulator of ABA responses across tissues and a key ripening regulator controlling ethylene-dependent and ethylene-independent aspects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
