Several pre-clinical and clinical studies were carried out to determine the potency of vigorous inhibitors but they extensively deteriorated the patient's quality of life. Hence, there exists an urgent need to explore potent natural remedy to fight against metastatic breast cancer.", "Ayurvedic medicinal plants documented in literature for their ability to fight against breast cancer was screened and their respective active moieties were evaluated to exert inhibitory effect against MMP9. Drug like efficacy of phytochemicals were determined using Molecular docking, MD Simulation, ADMET and MM-PBSA and were further compared with synthetic analogs i.e. Doxycycline.", "Out of 1000 phytochemicals, 12 exerted highest binding affinity (BA) even more than -9.0 kcal/mol that was significantly higher in comparison to Doxycycline which exhibited BA of -7.3 kcal/mol. In comparison to 37 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 37 \u00c5, 53 \u00d7 45 \u00d7 66 \u00c5 offered best binding site and the highest BA was exhibited by Viscosalactone at LYS104, ASP185, MET338, LEU39, ASN38. During MD Simulation, Viscosalactone-MMP9 complex remained stable for 20 ns and the kinetic, electrostatic and potential energies were observed to be better than Doxycycline.
