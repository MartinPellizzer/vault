The purified enzyme removed the terminal alpha1,2-linked glucose from Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-peptide or the endoglucosaminidase H (Endo H)-released oligosaccharide. Glucosidase I activity was inhibited by kojibiose [Glc(alpha1-2)Glc], but not by other glucose disaccharides. Removal of up to four mannose residues from the N-linked oligosaccharide had little effect on its utilization as a substrate for glucosidase I. The enzyme had a subunit molecular weight of 97 kDa on SDS gels and this was shifted to 94 kDa after treatment with Endo H or Endo F, suggesting that glucosidase I is an N-glycoprotein having one oligomannose-type oligosaccharide. Amino acid sequences of this enzyme showed considerable identity to the enzyme cloned from a human hippocampus cDNA library. The enzyme was inhibited by castanospermine, deoxynojirimycin, MDL, and trehazolin, but not by australine or kifunensine. On the other hand, the other processing glucosidase, glucosidase II, is sensitive to inhibition by australine, but not by trehazolin. Thus, these two inhibitors are useful to distinguish glucosidase I from glucosidase II. The mung bean glucosidase I is quite sensitive to the histidine modifying reagent diethyl pyrocarbonate, whereas the pig liver glucosidase I is not. On the other hand, pig liver and pig brain glucosidase I preparations are sensitive to the sulfhydryl reagent NEM (N-ethylmaleimide), whereas the plant enzyme is not. These sensitivities to amino acid modifiers suggest significant differences between the plant and animal glucosidase I, in terms of catalytic site or protein conformation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 1998 Academic Press."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas, 72211, USA."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Elbein", "ForeName": "A D", "Initials": "AD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "DK-21800", "Acronym": "DK", "Agency": "NIDDK NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-17783", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "glucosidase I"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.20", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Glucosidases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Stability"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Glucosidases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9647663", "10.1006/abbi.1998.0717", "S0003-9861(98)90717-2"]}}]}
