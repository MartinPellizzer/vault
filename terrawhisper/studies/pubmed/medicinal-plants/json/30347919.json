Aiming to address the resource shortage as well as the wild resource protection towards this herbal medicine, wide cultivation has been achieved in the southern Xinjiang. Herein, in-depth chemome comparison was conducted between cultivated and wild plants using \u00b9H-NMR spectroscopy that is capable of comprehensively providing qualitative and quantitative information of given complicated matrices. Multivariate statistical analysis was employed to process the dataset as well as to consolidate that the cultivated plants are comparable to those wild ones in term of chemome. \u00b9H-NMR spectra of both wild and cultivated plants were acquired in parallel after extraction. Following direct overlaying, great similarity occurred between these two groups. A total of 28 compounds were tentatively identified by referring to authentic compounds together with those available databases, such as HMDB and BMRB. Following principal component analysis, none significant difference was observed between wild and cultivated groups. Above all, from the viewpoint of chemical profile, the cultivated plants were almost equal to the wild plants; therefore, the cultivated plants are able to take the load of wild plants in clinical usage. Moreover, \u00b9H-NMR spectroscopy is a promising tool for chemical profiling traditional Chinese medicines because of the potential towards simultaneously exhibiting both quantitative and qualitative information for complicated matrices."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Meteria Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wen-Jing", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Meteria Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Meteria Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Qing-Qing", "Initials": "QQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Meteria Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Minority Traditional Medicine, Minzu University of China, Beijing 100081, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Meteria Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yun-Fang", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Meteria Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Tu", "ForeName": "Peng-Fei", "Initials": "PF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Meteria Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Meteria Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Yue-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cistanche"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30347919", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180530.003"]}}]}
