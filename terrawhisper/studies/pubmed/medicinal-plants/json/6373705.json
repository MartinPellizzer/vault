Studies of plant teratogens affecting livestock have not moved forward in a systematic nor rapid way because of the logistical problems connected with such experiments in large animals. Information that has accumulated can be conveniently separated into three categories: (1) known teratogens in known teratogenic plants, (2) known teratogenic plants with unidentified teratogens, and (3) suspected teratogenic plants. Included in the first group are the teratogens from Lupinus, Veratrum, Conium and Leucaena genera; in the second group are included the Astragalus , Nicotiana and Trachymene genera; and in the third group are included Datura, Prunus , Sorghum and Senecio genera. Total available information in each case varies, but in a few instances considerable fundamental as well as practical information is now known. Research has provided enough information in a few instances to enable elimination of the practical problem or significant reduction in incidence."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Keeler", "ForeName": "R F", "Initials": "RF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Anim Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8003002", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8812"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Teratogens"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["etiology", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Abnormalities, Drug-Induced"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Datura stramonium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Senecio"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Teratogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Veratrum"}], "NumberOfReferences": "59"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6373705", "10.2527/jas1984.5841029x"]}}]}
