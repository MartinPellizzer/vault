The taxonomy of all reported plants was authenticated using \"The Plant List\". Additional data on traditional uses was obtained from secondary references including books and online resources.", "Fourteen species were documented as traditional medicines in China, India, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia, specifically to manage rheumatism, pain, and trauma. Other species are used in the treatment of liver disorders, skin conditions, respiratory infections, cancer, diarrhea, malaria, paralysis, and many other conditions. The main phytochemical constituents identified were triterpenoids and saponins, with sesquiterpenes, phenylpropanoids, and lignans. Pharmacological properties of extracts and pure isolated compounds included analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, hypoglycemic, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, antimalarial, and antiallergic effects.", "The reported biological activities of Schefflera species support their traditional uses, although the available data, even for medicinal species, was limited. Reports of chemical constituents or biological activities could be found for only about 20 species, but suggest that further investigation of efficacy and safety of the largely unexplored genus Schefflera is necessary."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
