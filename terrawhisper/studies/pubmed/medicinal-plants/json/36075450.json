The exclusive advantage of Stevia over artificial sweeteners is impeccable and targets its potentiality to the presence of diterpene glycosides. Moreover, the flaunting sweetness of steviol glycosides with associated medicinal benefits, turns the plant to be one of the most economic assets, globally. As compared to vegetative propagation through stem-cuttings, plant tissue culture is the most suitable approach in obtaining true-to-type plants of superior quality. During last few decades, significant in vitro propagation methods have been developed and still the research is ongoing. The present review discusses the tissue culture perspectives of S. rebaudiana, primarily focusing on the mineral nutrition, growth regulators and other accessory factors, motioning the optimum growth and development of the plant. Another crucial aspect is the generation of sweeter varieties in order to reduce the bitter-off taste, which is noticed after the consumption of the leaves. The in vitro cultures pose an efficient alternative system for production of steviol glycosides, with higher rebaudioside(s) content. Moreover, the review also covers the recent approaches pertaining to scale-up studies and genome editing perspectives."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
