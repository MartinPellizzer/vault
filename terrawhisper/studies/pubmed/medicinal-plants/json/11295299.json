Seminal vesicles and ventral prostate showed a significant reduction at the higher dose only. Treated animals showed a notable depression of spermatogenesis. Following 100 and 200 mg/kg extract feeding, the preleptotene spermatocytes were decreased by 46.5 and 39.8%, the secondary spermatocytes by 13.4 and 12.7%, the step-19 spermatids by 36.6 and 35.2%, and the mature Leydig cells by 31.2 and 39.5%, respectively. At both dose levels, the seminiferous tubule diameter, Leydig cells nuclear area and cytoplasmic area, as well as the cross-sectional surface area of Sertoli cells, were significantly reduced (P<0.001) when compared to controls. Reduced sperm count and motility resulted in 100% negative fertility at 200 mg/kg dose level. A significant fall in the total protein and sialic acid content and acid phosphatase enzyme activity of the testes, epididymides, seminal vesicle and ventral prostate, as well as in the glycogen content of testes, was also observed at both dose levels in comparison with controls."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Reproduction Physiology Section, Department of Zoology, University of Rajasthan, -302 004, Jaipur, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yadav", "ForeName": "R K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dixit", "ForeName": "V P", "Initials": "VP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dobhal", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Fitoterapia", "NlmUniqueID": "16930290R", "ISSNLinking": "0367-326X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antispermatogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antispermatogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fertility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Leydig Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sertoli Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatogenesis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11295299", "10.1016/s0367-326x(00)00311-7", "S0367-326X(00)00311-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
