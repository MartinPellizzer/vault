They are widely distributed in plant foods like olive oil, nuts, seeds, and legumes. Amongst the variety of phytosterols, stigmasterol is the vital compound found abundantly in plants. Numerous hormones, including estrogen, progesterone, corticoids and androgen, are synthesized by stigmasterol. Multiple in-vitro and in-vivo investigations have shown that stigmasterol has various biological effects, including antioxidant, anticancer, antidiabetic, respiratory diseases, and lipid-lowering effects. Experimental research on stigmasterol provides indisputable proof that this phytosterol has the potential to be employed in supplements used to treat the illnesses mentioned above. This substance has a high potential, making it a noteworthy medication in the future. Although several researchers have investigated this phytosterol to assess its prospective qualities, it has not yet attained therapeutic levels, necessitating additional clinical studies. This review offers a comprehensive update on stigmasterol, including chemical framework, biosynthesis, synthetic derivatives, extraction and isolation, analytical aspects, pharmacological profile, patent status, clinical trials, stability and specifications as per regulatory bodies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
