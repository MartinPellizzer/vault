Retinal vessels were observed by immunofluorescence staining with cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) and histopathological evaluation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) content. Cell proliferation was detected by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in choroid-retinal endothelial RF/6A cells. VEGF-induced tube formation in RF/6A cells was observed. The contents of chlorogenic acid (CGA), caffeic acid (CA), and luteolin in FL were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).", "Histopathological evaluation demonstrated that retinal vessels were increased in STZ-induced PDR mice, whereas FL decreased such increase. The results of CD31 staining also showed that FL decreased the increased number of retinal vessels in STZ-induced PDR mice. In addition, FL reduced the increased serum VEGF content in STZ-induced PDR mice. FL reduced VEGF-induced RF/6A cell proliferation in the concentration-dependent manner, but had no obvious effect on RF/6A cell viability without VEGF stimulation. VEGF-induced tube formation in RF/6A cells was inhibited by different concentrations of FL. CGA, CA and luteolin all inhibited VEGF-induced tube formation in RF/6A cells, and the lowest effective concentration of CGA and CA was both 0.625\u03bcM, but of luteolin was 5\u03bcM. Furthermore, the results of HPLC demonstrated that the amount of CGA was the highest in FL.", "FL ameliorates STZ-induced PDR by inhibiting retinal angiogenesis.
