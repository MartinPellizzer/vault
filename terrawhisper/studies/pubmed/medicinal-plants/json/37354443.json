The <i>in vitro</i> metabolism of parthenolide (<b>1</b>), grosheimin (<b>2</b>), carbetolide C (<b>3</b>), 8<i>\u03b1</i>-O-(3,4-dihydroxy--methylenebutanoyloxy)-dehydromelitensin (<b>4</b>) and arteludovicinolide A\u00a0(<b>5</b>) was examined using human liver microsomes. Phase <i>I</i>, phase <i>II</i> (glucuronidation), as well as combined phase <i>I</i> + <i>II</i> metabolism were studied. Metabolites were identified <i>via</i> liquid chromatography-high resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Monohydroxylated, hydrated, carboxylated, methylated derivatives, together with corresponding monoglucuronides were detected, suggesting that the metabolism of sesquiterpene lactones is changeable due to structural features and scaffold diversity, though the lactone ring is the main site of metabolism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Chemistry, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Chemistry of Natural Products, Faculty of Pharmacy, School of Health Sciences, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece."}], "LastName": "Grafakou", "ForeName": "Maria-Eleni", "Initials": "ME"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Chemistry of Natural Products, Faculty of Pharmacy, School of Health Sciences, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece."}], "LastName": "Barda", "ForeName": "Christina", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Chemistry of Natural Products, Faculty of Pharmacy, School of Health Sciences, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece."}], "LastName": "Skaltsa", "ForeName": "Helen", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Chemistry, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany."}], "LastName": "Heilmann", "ForeName": "Joerg", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2RDB26I5ZB", "NameOfSubstance": "parthenolide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lactones"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "3"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37354443", "10.1080/14786419.2023.2226301"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
