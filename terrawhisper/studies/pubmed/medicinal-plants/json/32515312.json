The secondary metabolism of plants and other organisms provide substantial amounts of new chemical structures, many of which have numerous biological and pharmacological properties for virtually every existing disease, including cancer. In oncology, compounds such as vimblastine, vincristine, taxol, podophyllotoxin, captothecin and cytarabine are examples of how important natural products enhance the cancer-fighting therapeutic arsenal. In this context, this review presents an update of Ligand-Based Drug Design and Structure-Based Drug Design techniques applied to flavonoids, alkaloids and coumarins in the search of new compounds or fragments that can be used in oncology. A systematical search using various databases was performed. The search was limited to articles published in the last 10 years. The great diversity of chemical structures (coumarin, flavonoids and alkaloids) with cancer properties, associated with infinite synthetic possibilities for obtaining analogous compounds, creates a huge chemical environment with potential to be explored, and creates a major difficulty, for screening studies to select compounds with more promising activity for a selected target. CADD techniques appear to be the least expensive and most efficient alternatives to perform virtual screening studies, aiming to selected compounds with better activity profiles and better \"drugability\"."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Synthesis and Drug Delivery, State University of Paraiba, Joao Pessoa-PB, Brazil."}], "LastName": "de Ara\u00fajo", "ForeName": "Rodrigo Santos Aquino", "Initials": "RSA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, Nursing and Pharmacy School, Federal University of Alagoas, Maceio-AL, Brazil."}], "LastName": "da Silva-Junior", "ForeName": "Edeildo Ferreira", "Initials": "EF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, Nursing and Pharmacy School, Federal University of Alagoas, Maceio-AL, Brazil."}], "LastName": "de Aquino", "ForeName": "Thiago Mendon\u00e7a", "Initials": "TM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, Nursing and Pharmacy School, Federal University of Alagoas, Maceio-AL, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Scotti", "ForeName": "Marcus Tullius", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Western Sao Paulo (Unoeste), Presidente Prudente- SP, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Ishiki", "ForeName": "Hamilton M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Postgraduate Program in Natural and Synthetic Bioactive Products, Federal University of Paraiba, Joao Pessoa-PB, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Scotti", "ForeName": "Luciana", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Postgraduate Program in Natural and Synthetic Bioactive Products, Federal University of Paraiba, Joao Pessoa-PB, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Mendon\u00e7a-Junior", "ForeName": "Francisco Jaime Bezerra", "Initials": "FJB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer-Aided Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32515312", "10.2174/1568026620666200607191838", "CTMC-EPUB-107175"]}}]}
