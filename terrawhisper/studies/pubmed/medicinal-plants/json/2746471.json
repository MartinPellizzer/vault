According to the results obtained, 29 amino acids in Pinus densiflora (the tree aged 3), 27 amino acids in Pinus thunbergii (the tree aged 3) and 25 amino acids in both pine (the tree aged 25) were confirmed. The total amounts of free amino acids in Pinus densiflora were found to be more rich than in Pinus thunbergii. The peaks of many free amino acids in Pinus densiflora (the tree aged 3) were found in February, but in Pinus thunbergii (the tree aged 3) the peaks of free amino acids were observed in May and from February to April. The mode of occurrence of asparagine at germination of buds explains clearly the distinction between Pinus densiflora and Pinus thunbergii."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Arai", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hashimoto", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Koya", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2746471", "10.1248/yakushi1947.109.2_127"]}}]}
