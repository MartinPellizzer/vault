Although many previous studies have reported that this flavonol has diverse health-promoting effects, evidence for the underlying molecular mechanism of anti-cancer efficacy is still lacking. In this study, it was examined the anti-proliferative effect of isorhamnetin on human hepatocarcinoma Hep3B cells, and found that isorhamnetin induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis. Isorhamnetin-induced G2/M arrest was associated with decreased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen as well as cyclin A and cyclin B1. However, isorhamnetin increased expression of p21WAF1/CIP1, a cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor, and increased p21 complexed with Cdk2 and Cdc2. In addition, Isorhamnetin-induced apoptosis was associated with increased expression of Fas/Fas ligand, reduced ratio of Bcl-2/Bax expression, truncation of Bid, cytosolic release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-8, -9 and -3. Isorhamnetin also enhanced intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), while the addition of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a ROS inhibitor, significantly diminished isorhamnetin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, the interruption of ROS generation using NAC significantly attenuated isorhamnetin-mediated G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Collectively, this is the first report to show that isorhamnetin inhibited the proliferation of human hepatocarcinoma cells by ROS-dependent arrest of the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and induction of apoptosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Dongeui University College of Korean Medicine, Busanjin, Busan, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Yung Hyun", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Slovakia", "MedlineTA": "Gen Physiol Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "8400604", "ISSNLinking": "0231-5882"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "07X3IB4R4Z", "NameOfSubstance": "3-methylquercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31588915", "10.4149/gpb_2019038"]}}]}
