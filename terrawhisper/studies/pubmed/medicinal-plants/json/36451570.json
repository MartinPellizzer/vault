Iris florentina L. is a medicinal plant with traditional claims but ignored investigation regarding its hepatoprotective effects. The current study is aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective potential of I. florentina L. methanolic extract on paracetamol (PCM)-induced liver injury. The phytochemical and HPLC screening was done which showed the presence of potential constituents including flavonoids and phenols. For investigating the hepatoprotective effect of I. florentina L. methanolic extract, rats were given five different treatments for seven consecutive days. The normal control (group 1) was administered with normal saline, group 2 (Diseased) received paracetamol and group 3 (Standard) was given silymarin as reference drug. In group 4 and 5 (Treated), I. florentina L. methanolic extract (250 and 500mg/kg) were administered. Different serum biomarkers and histopathological studies were performed to assess the recovery caused by PCM in comparison to diseased group. The treatment of I. florentina methanolic extract significantly improve the serum biomarkers and restored the hepatic injury towards normal, indicating the hepatoprotective potential. Thus, we can conclude that I. florentina have significantly reversed the damage caused by paracetamol in hepatotoxic rat model due to their potential phytochemical constituents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Nawaz", "ForeName": "Muhammad Asif", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Aleem", "ForeName": "Ambreen", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Syed Adil", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Manzoor", "ForeName": "Majid", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Latif", "ForeName": "Samia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sarwar", "ForeName": "Muhammad Irfan", "Initials": "MI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Mohsin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Talib", "ForeName": "Sheeza", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "362O9ITL9D", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetaminophen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Acetaminophen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hepatitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36451570"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
