People commonly drove away mosquitoes by making smoke. They hung their clothes or books in the air to keep them free from moisture. This was effective in protecting them from becoming moldy or being damaged by insects. Various medicinal plants were used to eliminate harmful house insects or agricultural vermin. Camphor was a variety of insecticide, but it was not popular in early Edo times because it was not easily available then. But in the end of Edo period, camphor became popular as a moth repellent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Konishi Pharmaceutical Co., Kamiishikiri-cho, Higashioska."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hattori", "ForeName": "Akira", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakushigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "1267223", "ISSNLinking": "0285-2314"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "76-22-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Camphor"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Camphor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Modern 1601-"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Insect Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12755123"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
