However, research over Indian propolis is at infancy. This study was designed to investigate nutraceutical potential of Indian propolis.", "In the present study, propolis extract was standardized with respect to markers caffeic acid phenethyl ester, caffeic acid, galangin, luteolin, curcumin, apigenin, pinocembrin and quercetin by new high-performance thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) methods. The physico-chemical analysis, residues analysis and in vitro antioxidant activity analysis were performed. Nutraceutical value was examined in terms of fats, fibers, minerals, proteins, polysaccharides, total carbohydrates, and energy value.", "The developed HPTLC methods were found to be simple, reliable accurate, and the validation parameters were within the limits of the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidelines. Macerated ethanolic extract of propolis (MEEP) was found to have polyphenolic content of (20.99 \u00b1 0.24) mg/g and flavonoids content of (8.39 \u00b1 0.04) mg/g. MEEP was found to comprise of (283.33 \u00b1 51.31) g/kg fats, (30.07 \u00b1 7.30) g/kg fibers, (102.56 \u00b1 2.84) g/kg proteins and (389.36 \u00b1 57.50) g/kg carbohydrate with a calorie value of (38 409.33 \u00b1 6 169.80) kJ/kg. It was found that Indian propolis exhibited high nutraceutical value and showed absence of pesticides and heavy metals. The MEEP showed in vitro antioxidant activity with inhibitory concentration of (12.24 \u00b1 4.64) \u03bcg/mL.", "The present work explores Indian propolis as a potential nutritious candidate. The proposed analytical methods can be applied in future screening of the quality of Indian propolis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Bharati Vidyapeeth University, Poona College of Pharmacy, Pune 411038, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Sadhana", "ForeName": "Nanaware", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Bharati Vidyapeeth University, Poona College of Pharmacy, Pune 411038, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Lohidasan", "ForeName": "Sathiyanarayanan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Bharati Vidyapeeth University, Poona College of Pharmacy, Pune 411038, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Mahadik", "ForeName": "Kakasaheb Ramoo", "Initials": "KR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Integr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101603118"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142FWE6ECS", "NameOfSubstance": "galangin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8T7C8CH791", "NameOfSubstance": "pinocembrin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9009-62-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Propolis"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G960R9S5SK", "NameOfSubstance": "caffeic acid phenethyl ester"}, {"RegistryNumber": "ML9LGA7468", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylethyl Alcohol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U2S3A33KVM", "NameOfSubstance": "caffeic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bees"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavanones"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylethyl Alcohol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Propolis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29103419", "10.1016/S2095-4964(17)60360-1", "S2095-4964(17)60360-1"]}}]}
