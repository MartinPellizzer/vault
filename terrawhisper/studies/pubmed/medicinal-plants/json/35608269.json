In the present study, the unprecedented tautomerization mechanism of unstable physalins was elucidated by performing isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations, which led to the successful separation of tautomers and isolation of highly pure products for the first time. As a result, 15 new physalins, physaminins A-O (<b>1</b>-<b>15</b>), as well as 17 known analogues (<b>16</b>-<b>32</b>), were isolated from the whole plants of <i>Physalis minima</i> L. The chemical structures of the new compounds were established by performing a comprehensive analysis of spectroscopic data, and their absolute configurations were confirmed by using computational ECD calculations and/or single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. All obtained isolates were evaluated for their antiproliferative effects against four human cancer cell lines (A549, HepG2, MCF-7, and SCG-7901) and two noncancerous cell lines (RAW 264.7 and human normal hepatocytes L02), as well as their anti-inflammatory activities by measuring their abilities to inhibit NO production in LPS-stimulated murine RAW 264.7 cells <i>in vitro</i>. Compounds <b>1</b>-<b>5</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, <b>23</b>, and <b>30</b> exerted significant antiproliferative effects on the four human cancer lines, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.2(0) to 24.7(2) \u03bcM, and these compounds were not toxic to the two noncancerous cell lines at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM. Moreover, compounds <b>7</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>27</b> significantly inhibited NO production, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 2.9(1) to 9.5(2) \u03bcM."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jiang-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ling-Yu", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jing-Rong", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, Mississippi38677, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jianping", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6145-5509"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmaceutical Science, Soochow University, Suzhou, 215123, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Qiong-Ming", "Initials": "QM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6400-6167"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Syngenta, Jealott's Hill International Research Centre, BerkshireRE42 6EY, U.K."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Yu-Cheng", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2466-3146"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100193, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Zhong-Mei", "Initials": "ZM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Physalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RAW 264.7 Cells"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35608269", "10.1021/acs.jnatprod.2c00101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
