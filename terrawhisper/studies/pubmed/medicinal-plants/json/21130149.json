The extract (PEME) reduced carageenan induced paw edema in rat and mice, inhibited the formation of granulomatous tissue in cotton pellet induced granuloma after treatment and also decreased the reaction time in both early and late phases in formalin induced paw licking in rats.", "The study evidently confirmed anti-inflammatory activity of PEME and thus supported the traditional claim. The anti-inflammatory activity could be attributed to the phytoconstituent (flavonoids, alkaloids and steroid) present in the methanol extract of the plant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
