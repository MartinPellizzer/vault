In this paper, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of Wenjing decoction for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.", "Eight databases were used in our research: the Cochrane Library, the Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Chinese Scientific Journal Database, and the Wan-fang Database. The following search terms were used: (Wenjing decoction OR Wenjing formula OR Wenjing tang) AND (primary dysmenorrhea OR dysmenorrhea OR painful menstruation) AND (randomized controlled trial). No language limitation was used.", "A total of 18 studies, including 1736 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. Wenjing decoction was shown to be significantly better than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the improvement of primary dysmenorrhea according to the clinical effective rate (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.24-1.61), the visual analogue scale (MD -1.77, 95% CI -2.69 to -0.84), and the pain scale for dysmenorrhea (MD -1.81, 95% CI -2.41 to -1.22).", "The results supported the clinical use of Wenjing decoction for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. However, the quality of the evidence for this finding was low due to a high risk of bias in the included studies. Therefore, well-designed randomized controlled trials are still needed to further evaluate the efficacy of Wenjing decoction for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Preclinical Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, No. 11 North 3rd Ring East Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0532-551X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Preclinical Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, No. 11 North 3rd Ring East Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100029, China. chjia11@163.com."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Chunhua", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Preclinical Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, No. 11 North 3rd Ring East Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Heng", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Preclinical Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, No. 11 North 3rd Ring East Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Cuilan", "Initials": "C"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "81373770", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Review", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Arch Gynecol Obstet", "NlmUniqueID": "8710213", "ISSNLinking": "0932-0067"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dysmenorrhea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28791471", "10.1007/s00404-017-4485-7", "10.1007/s00404-017-4485-7"]}}]}
