The substitution levels were 3, 6, 9 and 12%. The sensory evaluation test was done by 25 trained judges using the hedonic scaling method (9 to 1 scoring). Internal and external characteristics of appearance, color, aroma, texture, bitterness and flavor, as well as general acceptability, were measured. Sensory evaluation results of the external characteristics were significant at the 9 and 12% SLF levels for color (p less than 0.05) while the other parameters did not show significant differences. In regard to the internal characteristics, a significant difference for color was found at the 3% level of SLF (p less than 0.05); and at 6, 9 and 12% SLF levels, for appearance (p less than 0.05). The general acceptability was good at all the levels tested, with no significant differences among them. An acceptability study at the consumer level for 9% lupine flour bread was carried out in a group of 90 girls, aged 10-12 years, during a 10-day period. The results showed a very good acceptability of the product (p less than 0.01). The results of this study indicate that the incorporation of 6% SLF to the bread, did not affect adversely its sensory properties. Moreover, the acceptability of bread containing up to 12% SLF was excellent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zacar\u00edas", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Y\u00e1\u00f1ez", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Araya", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ballester", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Evaluaci\u00f3n sensorial y estudio de aceptabilidad, a nivel de consumidor, de pan suplementado con harina de lupino dulce."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bread"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Consumer Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flour"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food, Fortified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3834871"]}}]}
