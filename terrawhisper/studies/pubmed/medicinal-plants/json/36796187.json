Due to multi-components and multi-targets in herbal medicine, it is extremely difficult to systematically explain its mechanisms of action.", "An innovative systematic investigation framework which combines with pharmacokinetic screening, target fishing, network pharmacology, DeepDDI algorithm, computational chemistry, molecular thermodynamics, in vivo and in vitro experiments was performed for deciphering the underlying molecular mechanisms of herbal medicine for treating VR.", "ADME screening and SysDT algorithm determined 75 potentially active compounds and 109 corresponding targets. Then, systematic analysis of networks reveals the crucial active ingredients and key targets in herbal medicine. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis identifies 33 key regulators during VR progression. Moreover, PPI network and biological function enrichment present four crucial signaling pathways, i.e. NF-\u03baB and TNF, PI3K-AKT and C-type lectin receptor signaling pathways involved in VR. Besides, both molecular experiments at animal and cell levels reveal the beneficial effect of herbal medicine on preventing VR. Finally, MD simulations and binding free energy validate the reliability of drug-target interactions.", "Our novelty is to build a systematic strategy which combines various theoretical methods combined with experimental approaches. This strategy provides a deep understanding for the study of molecular mechanisms of herbal medicine on treating diseases from systematic level, and offers a new idea for modern medicine to explore drug interventions for complex diseases as well."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
