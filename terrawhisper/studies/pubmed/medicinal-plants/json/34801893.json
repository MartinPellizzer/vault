Herein, we reported a turn-on near infrared (NIR) fluorescence detection strategy for Gsp based on a metal-organic framework (MOF), QBA-Yb, which was prepared from 4,4'-(quinolone-5, 8-diyl) benzoate with Yb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>\u00b75H<sub>2</sub>O by solvothermal synthesis. The Gsp acted as another \"antenna\" to sensitize the luminescence of Yb<sup>3+</sup>, leading to the turn-on NIR emission upon 467\u00a0nm excitation. As Gsp concentration increased, the NIR emission at 973\u00a0nm enhanced gradually, thus enabling highly sensitive Gsp detection in a turn-on way. The experiment and theoretical calculation results revealed the presence of strong hydrogen bonds between Gsp molecules and the MOF skeleton. The developed QBA-Yb probe showed excellent characteristics for detection of Gsp molecules, accompanied by wide linear range (5-160\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), low detection limit (0.65\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) and short response time (within 10\u00a0min). We have further demonstrated that the QBA-Yb probe was successfully applied for the determination of Gsp in real samples of cottonseeds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
