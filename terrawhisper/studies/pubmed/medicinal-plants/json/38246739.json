Magnetic dispersive micro solid phase extraction (MDMSPE) has been widely used for the separation and adsorption of heavy metal pollutants in medicinal plants and environmental samples. However, the majority of MDMSPE adsorbents have certain drawbacks, including low selectivity, poor anti-interference ability, and small adsorption capacity. Therefore, modifying currently available adsorption materials has gained attention in research.", "In this study, a novel adsorbent MCOF-DES based on a magnetic covalent organic framework (MCOF) modified by a new deep eutectic solvent (DES) was synthesized for the first time and used as an adsorbent of MDMSPE. The MDMSPE was combined with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) for selective separation, enrichment, and accurate determination of trace copper ion (Cu<sup>2+</sup>) in medicinal plants and environmental samples. Various characterization results show the successful preparation of new MCOF-DES. Under the optimal conditions, the enrichment factor (EF) of Cu<sup>2+</sup> was 30, the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.16\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 0.54\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>. The results for the determination of Cu<sup>2+</sup> were highly consistent with those of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), which verified the accuracy and reliability of the method.", "The established method based on a new adsorption material MCOF-DES has achieved the selective separation and determination of trace Cu<sup>2+</sup> in medicinal and edible homologous medicinal materials (Phyllanthus emblica Linn.) and environmental samples (soil and water), which provides a promising, selective, and sensitive approach for the determination of trace Cu<sup>2+</sup> in other real samples."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
