The unsaturated compounds were reduced to their respective 5 alpha-pregnanes, 5 beta-pregnane-3,20-dione was reduced to 5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one and 5 beta-pregnan-3 beta-ol-20-one was isomerized to the respective 3 alpha-pregnane. Suspension cultures of Digitalis lanata, on the other hand, accumulated both the 3 alpha- and the 3 beta-isomer of 5 beta-pregnan-3-ol-20-one when incubated in the presence of 5 beta-pregnane-3,20-dione. When 5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one was administered the cultured cells accumulated large amounts of the 3 beta-isomer together with small amounts of 5 beta-pregnane-3,20-dione, which may be regarded as an intermediate during the isomerization reaction. Cell-free, buffered extracts from light-grown shoots were shown to reduce 5 beta-pregnane-3,20-dione almost exclusively to 5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one when 0.05 M MgCl2 were present in the incubation mixture. Under these conditions the formation of 5 beta-pregnan-3 beta-ol-20-one was inhibited. The enzyme activity could be recovered from membrane-free supernatants. Optimum enzyme activity occurred at pH 7.0 and 42 degrees C. The energy of activation was 56.2 kJ/mol and the enzyme reaction was found to be NADPH-dependent. SH reagents were essential for enzyme activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmazeutisches Institut, Eberhard-Karls-Universit\u00e4t, T\u00fcbingen, Bundesrepublik Deutschland."}], "LastName": "Stuhlemmer", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Haussmann", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Milek", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kreis", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Reinhard", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Z Naturforsch C J Biosci", "NlmUniqueID": "8912155", "ISSNLinking": "0341-0382"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiac Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pregnanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1-", "NameOfSubstance": "3 alpha-hydroxysteroid-5 beta-oxidoreductase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiac Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Darkness"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isomerism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pregnanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8251035", "10.1515/znc-1993-9-1006"]}}]}
