Primary callus was induced by culturing mature tuber pieces on Murashige and Skoog's (MS) medium supplemented with 2.0 mg l(-1) N(6)-benzyladenine (BA) and 0.5 mg l(-1) alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) in darkness. Somatic embryos were induced by subculturing the primary callus on MS medium supplemented with 0.5-4.0 mg l(-1) BA, kinetin, or zeatin, within 2 weeks of culture in light. Embryos with well-developed cotyledonary leaves were transferred in half-strength liquid MS medium supplemented with 1.0 mg l(-1) zeatin riboside for the development of roots. Converted somatic embryos were cultured on half-strength MS medium supplemented with 6% sucrose, and with 0.5-10.0 mg l(-1) abscisic acid (ABA), paclobutrazol, or ancymidol, 0.5-5.0 mg l(-1) GA(3) and 15-100 mg l(-1) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 for further development of plantlets and in vitro tuber formation. The development of somatic embryos over the surface of tuber and/or cotyledonary leaf base region of the converted primary somatic embryo was observed. Before ex vitro establishment of somatic embryo-derived plants, plants with well-developed tubers were cultured on half-strength MS medium with 2% sucrose and 0.1 mg l(-1) GA(3) for 3 weeks."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy, Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute, 189, Chung-Cheng Road, Wufeng, 41301, Taichung, Taiwan"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sagare", "ForeName": "A P.", "Initials": "AP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Y L.", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "T C.", "Initials": "TC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "C C.", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsay", "ForeName": "H S.", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Plant Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9882015", "ISSNLinking": "0168-9452"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11164586", "10.1016/s0168-9452(00)00377-0", "S0168945200003770"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
