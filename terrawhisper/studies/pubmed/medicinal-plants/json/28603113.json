Present work was aimed to study the nephroprotective property of the plant extract through urinary enzymes excretion, to confirm its protective effects and to observe the antibacterial activities of gentamicin in combination with the plant extract. 200mg/kg/day of the plant extracts were administered alone and as co-therapy with gentamicin. Urinary lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and Urinary alkaline phospatase (ALP) excretions were observed through reagents kits with the help of Power-Lab 300. Antibacterial activities were assessed for gentamicin alone and in combination with the extract. Present study showed that the plant extract have excess quantity of flavonoids, which may responsible for attenuating the excessive excretion of urinary LDH. However, Urinary ALP excretion was found remained same throughout the study period in all experimental groups; might be detected in acute damage. Further, the plant also proved to have no decreasing impact on the antibacterial activities of gentamicin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Swabi, Swabi, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ullah", "ForeName": "Naveed", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Malakand, Chakdara, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Mir Azam", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Swabi, Swabi, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Salimullah", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Abasyn University, Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Roohullah", "ForeName": "-", "Initials": "-"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Swabi, Swabi, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Abad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Swabi, Swabi, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Waqar", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gentamicins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Urological Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaline Phosphatase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaline Phosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamomum zeylanicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytoprotection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disk Diffusion Antimicrobial Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Gentamicins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Urological Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28603113"]}}]}
