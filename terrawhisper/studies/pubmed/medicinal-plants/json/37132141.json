The QSAR study indicates that the five chemical descriptors were significantly correlated with anticancer activity. The important pharmacophore features identified were a hydrogen bond acceptor, a hydrophobic centre, and a negative ionizable centre. The model's predictive ability was evaluated against a set of chemically synthesized curcumin analogs. Among the tested compounds, nine curcumin analogs were found with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.10 to 1.86 \u03bcg/mL. The active analogs were assessed for pharmacokinetics compliance. EGFR was identified as a potential target of synthesized active curcumin analogs through docking studies.", "Integrating in silico design, QSAR-driven virtual screening, chemical synthesis, and experimental in vitro</i> evaluation may lead to the early discovery of novel and promising anticancer compounds from natural sources. The developed QSAR model and common pharmacophore generation were used as a designing and predictive tool to develop novel curcumin analogs. This study may help optimize the therapeutic relationships of studied compounds for further drug development and their potential safety concerns. This study may guide compound selection and designing novel active chemical scaffolds or new combinatorial libraries of the curcumin series."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7246-8687"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Computational Biology Unit, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal & Aromatic Plants, P.O.-CIMAP, Lucknow 226015 (Uttar Pradesh), India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-HRDC Campus, Postal Staff College Area, Sector 19, Kamla Nehru Nagar, Ghaziabad 201002 (Uttar Pradesh), India."}], "LastName": "Alam", "ForeName": "Sarfaraz", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1309-1709"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal & Aromatic Plants, P.O.-CIMAP, Lucknow 226015 (Uttar Pradesh), India."}], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Surjeet", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Bioprospection Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal & Aromatic Plants, P.O.-CIMAP, Lucknow 226015 (Uttar Pradesh), India."}], "LastName": "Fatima", "ForeName": "Kaneez", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6568-8107"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Bioprospection Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal & Aromatic Plants, P.O.-CIMAP, Lucknow 226015 (Uttar Pradesh), India."}], "LastName": "Luqman", "ForeName": "Suaib", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2558-6549"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal & Aromatic Plants, P.O.-CIMAP, Lucknow 226015 (Uttar Pradesh), India."}], "LastName": "Srivastava", "ForeName": "Santosh Kumar", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2704-5925"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Computational Biology Unit, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal & Aromatic Plants, P.O.-CIMAP, Lucknow 226015 (Uttar Pradesh), India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-HRDC Campus, Postal Staff College Area, Sector 19, Kamla Nehru Nagar, Ghaziabad 201002 (Uttar Pradesh), India."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Feroz", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "35"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37132141", "10.2174/0929867330666230428162720", "CMC-EPUB-131341"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
