Among them, Sea pens produce valuable chemical compounds being used as anti-cancer drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate anti-cancer property of extracted and purified compounds from marine organism Sea pen and evaluate their effects on inducing of apoptosis. The extracts were prepared from dried colony of Virgularia gustaviana. The compounds (3\u03b2)-Cholest,5en,3ol (cholesterol) (15\u00a0mg), Hexadecanoic acid (2.5\u00a0mg) and 2-Hexadecanol (10.7\u00a0mg) were identified by GC-MS and NMR. The cytotoxic effects of the compounds were evaluated on Hela and MDA-Mb-231 human cancer cell lines with MTT assay. Immunocytochemistry and Western Blot analyses were used to evaluate the expression of apoptosis related markers Caspase 3, Caspase 8, Bax and BCL2 in cancer cells after treating with three compounds. The purified compounds reduced viability of human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and human cervical cancer cell line Hela concentration-dependently. 2-Hexadecanol reduced significantly the viability of both cancer cell lines in comparison to the other purified compounds. Treatment of cancer cells with the three purified compounds increased the expression of caspase-3, caspase-8 and Bax proteins and decreased the relative Bcl-2/Bax ratio, demonstrating induction of apoptosis as possible mechanism of action. According to the results, three purified compounds inhibit the growth of cancer cells by inducing of apoptosis pathway; an effect which needs to be further investigated in the future studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
