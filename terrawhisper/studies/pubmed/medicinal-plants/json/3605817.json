Experimentally induced C roemeriana poisoning in both species resulted in hepatopathic poisoning characterized by a brief survival period (3.9 to 7.9 days), moderate-to-severe hepatocellular damage, and little or no evidence of injury to skeletal muscle or resulted in myopathic poisoning characterized by a longer period of survival, mild-to-severe skeletal myopathy, and mild hepatocellular injury. The minimal dosage that induced hepatopathic poisoning (also the minimal lethal dosage) was 10 g/kg/day for 3 days in calves and for 5 days in goats. The minimal dosage that induced the myopathic syndrome (as determined by the earliest increase in serum creatine kinase activity) was 10 g/kg/day for 6 days for calves and 5 g/kg/day for 10 to 16 days for goats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rowe", "ForeName": "L D", "Initials": "LD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Corrier", "ForeName": "D E", "Initials": "DE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Reagor", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "L P", "Initials": "LP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Vet Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0375011", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9645"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cassia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Goats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3605817"]}}]}
