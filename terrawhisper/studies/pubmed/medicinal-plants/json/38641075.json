This region is not only rich in ethnic and cultural diversity, but it is also a major biodiversity hotspot. The sustainable use of these bioresources can contribute to the region's bioeconomic development.", "The review aimed to deliver various perspectives on the development of bioeconomy from NER bioresources under the tenets of sustainable utilization and socioeconomic expansion.", "Relevant information related to prospects of the approaches and techniques pertaining to the sustainable use of ethnomedicine resources for the growth of the bioeconomy were retrieved from PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Springer from 1984 to 2023.
