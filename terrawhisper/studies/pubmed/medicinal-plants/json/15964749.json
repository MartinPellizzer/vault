The results showed that there were evident difference between the results of Serum Pharmacology and that of Traditional Pharmacology. There was no significant difference between the drug effect of crude GS on nitric oxide (NO) production in ECV304 and that of crude GBE, and the drug effect of GG was superior to that of GS and GBE, respectively. But, compared with GBE serum, the GS serum up-regulation of NO production in ECV304 increased significantly, and the GG serum up-regulation of the NO production in ECV304 was inferior to that of GS serum and GBE serum significantly. The results suggested that Serum Pharmacological study should be adopted in the pharmacological investigation on the Chinese traditional medicine and the drug screening of the Chinese traditional medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Biomechanics & Tissue Engineering under the State Ministry of Education, Bioengineering College, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, PR China. wangbc2000@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bochu", "ForeName": "Wang", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liancai", "ForeName": "Zhu", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "9315133", "ISSNLinking": "0927-7765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelium, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15964749", "10.1016/j.colsurfb.2005.04.013", "S0927-7765(05)00148-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
