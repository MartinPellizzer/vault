The plant relevant for medicinal use is <i>Cannabis</i> <i>sativa</i> that has two pharmacologically active ingredients - delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol that is psychoactive and cannabidiol that does not have psychotropic activity. The policy tapestry of Cannabis has undergone a significant change in the past few decades worldwide. Different countries have diverse policies, ranging from classifying use of Cannabis as illicit, to legalization of its use, both for medicinal and recreational purposes. Cannabis products are approved for use, for instance, in multiple sclerosis and Dravet syndrome (US Food Drug and Administration). Against this backdrop, we find that the knowledge foundations for use of Cannabis in clinical trials in India are still evolving. Conducting ethical research within a clinical trials framework is essential to understand dosing, formulation, shelf life, drug-drug interaction, tolerability, and safety before establishing its utility for various indications. In the absence of guidelines or a regulatory framework for conduct of these studies, the various Institutional Ethics Committees (IECs), which are responsible for reviewing projects related to Cannabis, face unique challenges with respect to the basic requirements. The principal investigators (PIs) are equally strained to find local guidance, recommendations, and literature in support of their application to the respective IEC, thus leading to an impasse and delay in initiating the proposed clinical studies with Cannabis. The present article addresses considerations, questions, and issues that affect the conduct of these clinical studies and recommends mandatory documents and some suggested guidelines for use by both PIs and IECs to take studies with Cannabis forward until such time that an interdisciplinary regulatory framework is firmed up by regulatory authority."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2023 Perspectives in Clinical Research."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tata Memorial Hospital, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Nayak", "ForeName": "Prakash", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tata Memorial Hospital, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Pantvaidya", "ForeName": "Gouri", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tata Memorial Hospital, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Ranganathan", "ForeName": "Priya", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tata Memorial Hospital, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Jiwnani", "ForeName": "Sabita", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tata Memorial Hospital, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Joshi", "ForeName": "Shalaka", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacology, KEM Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Gogtay", "ForeName": "Nithya Jaideep", "Initials": "NJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Perspect Clin Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101551517", "ISSNLinking": "2229-3485"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Touw M.
