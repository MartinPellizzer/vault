Many people, either knowing their effects or not, are using these herbal products. Treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) is yet a complicated clinical challenge and there is need to improve or make new therapeutic targets. Finding new agents for CHF is an important subject in cardiovascular drug research. In this study, we evaluated the effects of ten herbals on treatment of CHF on isoproterenol-induced model.", "Ninety-six male Wistar rats (16 weeks old) were used in 12 groups. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on the rats for confirmation of CHF model by decreasing ejection fraction. After 4 weeks' treatment, hearts were removed and blood samples were collected in tubes to measure plasma levels of laboratory findings. Our results showed that the mean of ejection fraction in model rats was 51.82 \u00b1 3.49 percent and all of our used natural products could significantly increase the ejection fraction (P < 0.01). The most effective herbals in improving the ejection fraction were Allium sativum (30.69 %), Peganum harmala (26.08 %) and Apium graveolens (24.09 %). The best results in decreasing NT-ProBNP, was obtained from Allium sativum, Peganum harmala and Berberis vulgaris respectively. Our results showed that none of natural products had toxic effect on renal and liver tissues.", "Our results showed that Allium sativum, Peganum harmala and Berberis vulgaris could significantly improve cardiac function by improvement of left ventricular remodeling, lowering hs-CRP and NT-ProBNP and echocardiographic indexes without liver or renal side effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
