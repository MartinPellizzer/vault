Tomato has served as a model member of this family largely because of its enriched cytogenetic, genetic, as well as physical, maps. Mapping has helped in cloning several genes of importance such as Pto, responsible for resistance against bacterial speck disease, Mi-1.2 for resistance against nematodes, and fw2.2 QTL for fruit weight. A high-throughput genome-sequencing program has been initiated by an international consortium of 10 countries. Since heterochromatin has been found to be concentrated near centromeres, the consortium is focusing on sequencing only the gene-rich euchromatic region. Genomes of the members of Solanaceae show a significant degree of synteny, suggesting that the tomato genome sequence would help in the cloning of genes for important traits from other Solanaceae members as well. ESTs from a large number of cDNA libraries have been sequenced, and microarray chips, in conjunction with wide array of ripening mutants, have contributed immensely to the understanding of the fruit-ripening phenomenon. Work on the analysis of the tomato proteome has also been initiated. Transgenic tomato plants with improved abiotic stress tolerance, disease resistance and insect resistance, have been developed. Attempts have also been made to develop tomato as a bioreactor for various pharmaceutical proteins. However, control of fruit quality and ripening remains an active and challenging area of research. Such efforts should pave the way to improve not only tomato, but also other solanaceous crops."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics, Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Vikrant", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mathur", "ForeName": "Saloni", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Solanke", "ForeName": "Amolkumar U", "Initials": "AU"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Manoj K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Rahul", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vyas", "ForeName": "Shailendra", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khurana", "ForeName": "Paramjit", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khurana", "ForeName": "Jitendra P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tyagi", "ForeName": "Akhilesh K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Arun K", "Initials": "AK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8505177", "ISSNLinking": "0738-8551"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Genomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}], "NumberOfReferences": "432"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19319709", "10.1080/07388550802688870", "909858211"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
