And through the root isolation treatment, we preliminarily explored the formation mechanism of the four kinds of matching plants of soil physical and chemical properties and soil enzyme activities of S. miltiorrhiza, and chose the matching plants suitable for the establishment of the compound population with S. miltiorrhiza,and provided the basis for constructing high efficiency compound planting pattern of S. miltiorrhiza. The results showed that there were significant differences in soil physical and chemical properties and soil enzyme activitiesof Salvia miltiorrhiza in different compound population mixed.The combination of C. obtusifolia, P. frutescens, Z. mays and S. miltiorrhiza mixed planting were all reduced the soil cation exchange capacity and soil enzyme activities, and increased the soil electric conductivity. The compound planting of P. frutescens and S. miltiorrhiza increased the soil cation exchange capacity and soil enzyme activities, and reduced the soil electric conductivity. Therefore,The compound planting population of P. frutescens and S. miltiorrhiza is conducive to improve soil physical and chemical properties and increase soil microbial activity, which is the best collocation species of S. miltiorrhiza."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China."}], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Qiao-Sheng", "Initials": "QS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chang-Lin", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China."}], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Enzymes"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29950064", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180329.010"]}}]}
