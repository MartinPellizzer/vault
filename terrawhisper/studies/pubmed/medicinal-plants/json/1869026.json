The effect of intraperitoneal administration of Panax ginseng on the development of tolerance to the analgesic and hyperthermic actions of morphine was determined in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were rendered tolerant to morphine to different degrees by the subcutaneous implantation of either four pellets of morphine over a 3-day period or six pellets over a 7-day period. Each pellet contained 75 mg of morphine free base. Rats serving as controls were implanted with placebo pellets. 2. Daily administration of ginseng extract (6.25-50.0 mg/kg) for 3 days inhibited the development of tolerance to the analgesic effect but not to the hyperthermic effect of morphine in the four pellet schedule. 3. In six pellet schedule, daily administration of ginseng extract (25 and 50 mg/kg) for 7 days also inhibited the development of tolerance to the analgesic effect of morphine, but the 100 mg/kg dose had no effect. On the other hand, in six pellet schedule, the administration of ginseng extract (50 and 100 mg/kg) once daily for 7 days inhibited the development of tolerance to the hyperthermic effect of morphine. 4. It is concluded that in appropriate doses, ginseng extract has inhibitory activity on the development of tolerance to the pharmacological actions of morphine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacodynamics University of Illinois, Chicago 60612."}], "LastName": "Bhargava", "ForeName": "H N", "Initials": "HN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ramarao", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "DA-02598", "Acronym": "DA", "Agency": "NIDA NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Gen Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7602417", "ISSNLinking": "0306-3623"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "76I7G6D29C", "NameOfSubstance": "Morphine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Morphine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Reaction Time"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1869026", "10.1016/0306-3623(91)90017-z", "0306-3623(91)90017-Z"]}}]}
