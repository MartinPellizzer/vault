There have been many studies on the therapeutic potential of the natural products against snake envenomation.", "This review has highlighted snake venom inhibitory activity of bioactive compounds and peptides from plants that have found a traditional use in treating snakebite envenomation. We have systematically reviewed the scenario of different phases of natural snake venom inhibitors characterization covering a period from 1994 until the present and critically analysed the lacuna of the studies if any, and further scope for their translation from bench to bedside.", "The medicinal plant-derived compounds used against snakebite therapy were reviewed from the available literature in public databases (Scopus, MEDLINE) from 1994 till 2020. The search words used were 'natural inhibitors against snakebite,' 'natural products as therapeutics against snakebite,' 'natural products as antidote against snake envenomation,' ' snake venom toxin natural inhibitors,' 'snake venom herbal inhibitors'. However, the scope of this review does not include computational (in silico) predictions without any wet laboratory validation and snake venom inhibitory activity of the crude plant extracts. In addition, we have also predicted the ADMET properties of the identified snake venom inhibitors to highlight their valuable pharmacokinetics for future clinical studies.", "The therapeutic application of plant-derived natural inhibitors to treat snakebite envenomation as an auxiliary to antivenom therapy has been gaining significant momentum. Pharmacological reassessment of the natural compounds derived from traditional medicinal plants has demonstrated inhibition of the principal toxic enzymes of snake venoms at various extents to curb the lethal and/or deleterious effects of venomous snakebite. Nevertheless, such molecules are yet to be commercialized for clinical application in the treatment of snakebite. There are many obstacles in the marketability of the plant-derived natural products as snake envenomation antidote and strategies must be explored for the translation of these compounds from drug candidates to their clinical application.", "In order to minimize the adverse implications of snake envenomation, strategies must be developed for the smooth transition of these plant-derived small molecule inhibitors from bench to bedside. In this article we have presented an inclusive review and have critically analysed natural products for their therapeutic potential against snake envenomation, and have proposed a road map for use of natural products as antidote against snakebite."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
