In a 4-week feeding trial, raw limabeans Phaseolus lunatus and extracted limabean fractions were tested as dietary ingredients in broiler starter diets. During the study, parameters such as body weight, lengths of intestinal sections as well as weights and histopathology of some organs (liver, kidney, heart, adrenals, spleen, brain, pancreas and small intestine) were investigated. 2. With the exception of broiler chicks fed on the diet containing soaked/boiled limabeans, growth was severely hindered in chicks fed on diets containing raw limabeans and limabean fractions. 3. Significant treatment differences in lengths of some intestinal sections were observed. The relative weights of the liver and spleen decreased, and the weights of the kidney, adrenals, small intestine and caecum increased in birds fed on diets containing raw limabeans and fractions containing high concentrations of anti-nutritional factors, whereas there was no difference in the weights of these organs in soaked/boiled limabean diet-fed birds. 4. The inclusion of raw limabeans, base-soluble protein, acid-soluble protein, defatted limabean and ether extracted meal in the diets for growing chickens was shown to produce serious histopathological changes within the livers, kidneys, pancreases, spleen and lungs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science, University of Ibadan, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ologhobo", "ForeName": "A D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Apata", "ForeName": "D F", "Initials": "DF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oyejide", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Akinpelu", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br Poult Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "15740290R", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Intestines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8358638", "10.1080/00071669308417606"]}}]}
