In this study, we examined the level of cellular oxidants, cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by hydroalcoholic extract of U. dioica radix (0-2000 \u00b5g/mL) and oxaliplatin (0-1000 \u00b5g/mL, as positive control) in human gastric (MKN45) and colon (HT29) cancer, as well as normal human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells. Exposure to U. dioica or oxaliplatin showed a concentration dependent suppression in cell survival with IC50 values of 24.7, 249.9 and 857.5 \u00b5g/mL for HT29, MKN45 and HFF cells after 72 h treatment, respectively. ROS formation and lipid peroxidation were also concentration-dependently increased following treatment with U. dioica, similar to oxaliplatin. In addition, the number of apoptotic cells significantly increased concomitantly with concentration of U. dioica as compared with control cells, which is similar to oxaliplatin and serum-deprived cancer cells. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that U. dioica inhibited proliferation of gastric and colorectal cancer cells while posing no significant toxic effect on normal cells. U. dioica not only increased levels of oxidants, but also induced concomitant increase of apoptosis. The precise signaling pathway by which U. dioica induce apoptosis needs further research."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mashhad University of Medical Sciences Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Medicine Mashhad Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghasemi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mashhad University of Medical Sciences Neurocognitive Research Center, Faculty of Medicine Mashhad Iran."}], "LastName": "Moradzadeh", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mashhad University of Medical Sciences Medical Toxicology Research Center, Faculty of Medicine Mashhad Iran."}], "LastName": "Mousavi", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mashhad University of Medical Sciences Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Medicine Mashhad Iran sadeghniahr@mums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Sadeghnia", "ForeName": "H R", "Initials": "HR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organoplatinum Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "04ZR38536J", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxaliplatin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Colonic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HT29 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Organoplatinum Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxaliplatin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Urtica dioica"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27755943"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
