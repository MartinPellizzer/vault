Recent studies have shown that ferroptosis may damage glucose-stimulated islets \u03b2 Insulin secretion and programmed cell death of T2DM target organs are involved in the pathogenesis of T2DM and its complications. Targeting suppression of ferroptosis with specific inhibitors may provide new therapeutic opportunities for previously untreated T2DM and its target organs. Current studies suggest that natural bioactive compounds, which are abundantly available in drugs, foods, and medicinal plants for the treatment of T2DM and its target organs, have recently received significant attention for their various biological activities and minimal toxicity, and that many natural compounds appear to have a significant role in the regulation of ferroptosis in T2DM and its target organs. Therefore, this review summarized the potential treatment strategies of natural compounds as ferroptosis inhibitors to treat T2DM and its complications, providing potential lead compounds and natural phytochemical molecular nuclei for future drug research and development to intervene in ferroptosis in T2DM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
