Although substantial medical advances have been made and many therapeutic approaches proposed yet traditional medicine and medicinal plants find an important place in therapy. They have been providing invaluable solutions to the various health problems. Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is a natural anthraquinone derivative found in various Chinese medicinal herbs. Traditionally, it has been used as an active constituent of many herbal laxatives. However, in the last few years, significant progress has been made in studying the biological effects of emodin at cellular and molecular levels and it is emerging as an important therapeutic agent. This review provides an overview of the modulatory effects of emodin in various diseases and cell signaling pathways, which may have important implications in its future clinical use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Science, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, 620024, India."}], "LastName": "Monisha", "ForeName": "B Anu", "Initials": "BA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Radiation and Cancer Therapeutics Lab, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, 110067, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Niraj", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Radiation and Cancer Therapeutics Lab, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, 110067, India. abtiku@mail.jnu.ac.in."}], "LastName": "Tiku", "ForeName": "Ashu Bhan", "Initials": "AB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Adv Exp Med Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0121103", "ISSNLinking": "0065-2598"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "KA46RNI6HN", "NameOfSubstance": "Emodin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Emodin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27671812", "10.1007/978-3-319-41334-1_3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
