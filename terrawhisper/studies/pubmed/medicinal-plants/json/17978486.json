To explore the mechanism underlying this effect, we used 3T3-L1 adipocytes for analyzing the signaling pathways that contribute to glucose transport. Treatment of berberine to 3T3-L1 adipocytes for 6 h enhanced basal glucose uptake both in normal and in insulin-resistant state, but the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was not augmented significantly. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) by wortmannin did not affect the berberine effect on basal glucose uptake. Berberine did not augment tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1. Further, berberine had no effect on the activity of the insulin-sensitive downstream kinase, atypical protein kinase C (PKCzeta/lambda). However, interestingly, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), which have been known to be responsible for the expression of glucose transporter (GLUT)1, were significantly activated in berberine-treated 3T3-L1 cells. As expected, the level of GLUT1 protein was increased both in normal and insulin-resistant cells in response to berberine. But berberine affected the expression of GLUT4 neither in normal nor in insulin-resistant cells. In addition, berberine treatment increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in 3T3-L1 cells, which has been reported to be associated with GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake. Together, we concluded that berberine increases glucose transport activity of 3T3-L1 adipocytes by enhancing GLUT1 expression and also stimulates the GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake by activating GLUT1, a result of AMPK stimulation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life and Food Sciences, Handong Global University, Pohang, Kyonbuk, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "So Hui", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "Eun-Jung", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Eun-Do", "Initials": "ED"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bayaraa", "ForeName": "Tsenguun", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frost", "ForeName": "Susan Cooke", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hyun", "ForeName": "Chang-Kee", "Initials": "CK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose Transporter Type 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Slc2a1 protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0I8Y3P32UF", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "3T3-L1 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adipocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose Transporter Type 1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17978486", "10.1248/bpb.30.2120", "JST.JSTAGE/bpb/30.2120"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
