As different bioactivities continue being discovered and relevant food and pharmaceutical applications gradually emerge for cFF, there is a growing need for establishing convenient and efficient methods to access this type of compound. Here, we present a robust cFF production system which entailed stepwise engineering of the filamentous fungal strain Aspergillus nidulans A1145 as a heterologous expression host. We first established a preliminary cFF producing strain by introducing the heterologous nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene penP1 to A. nidulans A1145. Key metabolic pathways involving shikimate and aromatic amino acid biosynthetic support were then engineered through a combination of gene deletions of competitive pathway steps, over-expressing feedback-insensitive enzymes in phenylalanine biosynthesis, and introducing a phosphoketolase-based pathway, which diverted glycolytic flux toward the formation of erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P). Through the stepwise engineering of A. nidulans A1145 outlined above, involving both heterologous pathway addition and native pathway metabolic engineering, we were able to produce cFF with titers reaching 611\u00a0mg/L in shake flask culture and 2.5\u00a0g/L in bench-scale fed-batch bioreactor culture. Our study establishes a production platform for cFF biosynthesis and successfully demonstrates engineering of phenylalanine derived diketopiperazines in a filamentous fungal host."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 International Metabolic Engineering Society.
