Each individual that lives encounters some manifestation of stress in life. Stress causes certain alterations in the structure and functions of the body and is considered to be a major factor in many health problems. Many synthetic and natural compounds are used for the attenuation of stress induced changes in the body. Medicinal plants are used since ancient times to prevent from neurological disorders. Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) is very efficacious and possesses the ability to improve several neurological disorders. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used against pain and inflammation. However, effectiveness of NSAIDs in the treatment of various psychiatric ailments is also reported. The present study investigated the effects of ibuprofen and lavender oil on stress induced behavioral and biochemical alterations in rats. The rats were subjected to restraint stress and behavioral parameters like open field test (OFT), light/dark transition box activity (LDT) and forced swim test (FST) were used to assess exploratory, anxiolytic and anti-depressant activity, respectively. Corticosterone, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and endogenous antioxidant enzymes activities were also estimated. Results of OFT, LDT and FST showed substantial effects of lavender oil and standard drug ibuprofen. A significant decrease in plasma corticosterone and LPO levels with increase in antioxidant enzyme activities was observed in the study. However, the effects of lavender oil were more as compared to standard drug ibuprofen in diminution of stress induced behavioral and biochemical changes in rats. This study demonstrates that lavender oil is more remedial than ibuprofen in stress related disorders."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurochemistry and Biochemical Neuropharmacology Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry, University of Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Qadeer", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurochemistry and Biochemical Neuropharmacology Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry, University of Karachi, Pakistan / Department of Biochemistry, Jinnah Medical & Dental College Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Emad", "ForeName": "Shaista", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurochemistry and Biochemical Neuropharmacology Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry, University of Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Perveen", "ForeName": "Tahira", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurochemistry and Biochemical Neuropharmacology Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry, University of Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Yousuf", "ForeName": "Sarwat", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurochemistry and Biochemical Neuropharmacology Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry, University of Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sheikh", "ForeName": "Sheeza", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurochemistry and Biochemical Neuropharmacology Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry, University of Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sarfaraz", "ForeName": "Yousra", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurochemistry and Biochemical Neuropharmacology Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry, University of Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sadaf", "ForeName": "Sana", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurochemistry and Biochemical Neuropharmacology Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry, University of Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Haider", "ForeName": "Saida", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "W980KJ009P", "NameOfSubstance": "Corticosterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WK2XYI10QM", "NameOfSubstance": "Ibuprofen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "ZBP1YXW0H8", "NameOfSubstance": "lavender oil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Corticosterone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ibuprofen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lavandula"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Psychological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30058555"]}}]}
