When C57 mice were pretreated with EGb 761 (20, 50, 100 mg/kg/d i.p.) for 7 days and then treated with the same extract 30 min before MPTP injection for 6 days, the neurotoxic effect of MPTP was antagonized in a dose-dependent fashion. Similar treatment with ginkgolides A and B (5, 10, 50 mg/kg/d i.p.) showed no protective effect. When C57 mice were treated with EGb 761 (50 mg/kg/d i.p.) after MPTP-lesion, the recovery of striatal dopamine (DA) levels was accelerated. However, similar treatment with ginkgolides A or B (10 mg/kg/d i.p.) did not show any effect. EGb 761, but not ginkgolides A and B, nonselectively inhibited mouse brain MAO activity in vitro (IC50 = 36.45 +/- 1.56 microg/ml) tested by an improved fluorimetric assay. The results demonstrate that EGb 761 administered before or after MPTP treatment effectively protects against MPTP-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity and that the inhibitory effect of EGb 761 on brain MAO may be involved in its neuroprotective effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of pharmacology, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "W R", "Initials": "WR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "X Z", "Initials": "XZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375521", "ISSNLinking": "0024-3205"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19FUJ2C58T", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginkgo biloba extract"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9P21XSP91P", "NameOfSubstance": "1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VTD58H1Z2X", "NameOfSubstance": "Dopamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Corpus Striatum"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Dopamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nerve Regeneration"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Substantia Nigra"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10416821", "10.1016/s0024-3205(99)00232-5", "S0024320599002325"]}}]}
