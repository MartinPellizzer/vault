Biochemical sensors are now a common part of medical applications, such as detecting blood glucose levels, detecting food pathogens, and detecting specific cancers. As an exciting feature, bio-affinity couples, such as proteins with aptamers, ligands, paired nucleotides, and antibodies with antigens, are commonly used as bio-sensitive elements in electrochemical biosensors. Biotin-avidin interactions have been utilized for various purposes in recent years, such as targeting drugs, diagnosing clinically, labeling immunologically, biotechnology, biomedical engineering, and separating or purifying biomolecular compounds. The interaction between biotin and avidin is widely regarded as one of the most robust and reliable noncovalent interactions due to its high bi-affinity and ability to remain selective and accurate under various reaction conditions and bio-molecular attachments. More recently, there have been numerous attempts to develop electrochemical sensors to sense circulating cancer cells and the measurement of intracellular levels of protein thiols, formaldehyde, vitamin-targeted polymers, huwentoxin-I, anti-human antibodies, and a variety of tumor markers (including alpha-fetoprotein, epidermal growth factor receptor, prostate-specific Ag, carcinoembryonic Ag, cancer antigen 125, cancer antigen 15-3, <i>etc</i>.). Still, the non-specific binding of biotin to endogenous biotin-binding proteins present in biological samples can result in false-positive signals and hinder the accurate detection of cancer biomarkers. This review summarizes various categories of biotin-functional nanoparticles designed to detect such biomarkers and highlights some challenges in using them as diagnostic tools."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1712-9367"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, 94531-55166 Iran. soniafathi92@gmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Advanced Sciences and Technologies in Medicine, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd 9414974877, Iran. soniafathi92@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Fathi-Karkan", "ForeName": "Sonia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2255-5977"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Research Institute of Cellular and Molecular Sciences in Infectious Diseases, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran. sgz.biomed@gmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran. sgz.biomed@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Sargazi", "ForeName": "Saman", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nano Drug Delivery Research Center, Health Technology Institute, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran. shojaeishirin891@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Shojaei", "ForeName": "Shirin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1598-2487"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran.
