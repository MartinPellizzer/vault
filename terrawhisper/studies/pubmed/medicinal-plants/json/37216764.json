Based on the least AAAs in dry roots and rhizomes of Asarum heterotropoides, Asarum sieboldii Miq and Asarum sieboldii var, all of which are enrolled in the Chinese pharmacopeia up to now. AAAs distribution in Aristolochiaceae plants, especially Asarum L. plants, is still obscure and controversial due to few AAAs measured, unverified species of Asarum, and complicated pretreatment in analytical samples making the results more challenging to reproduce. In the present study, a simple ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method in dynamic multiple reaction monitoring mode for simultaneous determination of thirteen AAAs was developed for evaluating the distribution of toxicity phytochemicals in Aristolochiaceae plants. The sample was prepared by extracting Asarum and Aristolochia powder with methanol, and the supernatant was analyzed using the Agilent 6410 system on an ACQUITY UPLC HSS PFP column with gradient elution of water and acetonitrile, containing 1% v/v formic acid (FA) each, at a flow rate of 0.3\u00a0mL/min. The chromatographic condition provided good peak shape and resolution. The method was linear over the specific ranges with the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>)\u00a0>\u00a00.990. Satisfactory intra- and inter-day precisions were achieved with RSD less than 9.79%, and the average recovery factors obtained were in the range of 88.50%\uff5e105.49%%. The proposed method was successfully applied for simultaneous quantification of the 13 AAAs in 19 samples from 5 Aristolochiaceae species, especially three Asarum L. species enrolled in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Except Asarum heterotropoides, the results supported that the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020 Edition) adopting the root with rhizome as medicinal parts of Herba Asari instead of the whole herb for drug safety by providing scientific data."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
