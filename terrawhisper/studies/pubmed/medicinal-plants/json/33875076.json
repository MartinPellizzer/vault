However, the application of nano-preparation has been limited owing to the low content of active ingredients in part TCM. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate plant growth, development, and response to environmental stresses at post-transcriptional regulation level by cleavage or translational inhibition. The molecular functions of miRNAs playing a role in synthesizing active comportments at medicinal plants have been widely researched. Dendrobium nobile is a perennial herb in the orchidaceae family. D. nobile protocorm can produce plant-specific metabolites at a short period. Therefore, it is a good substitute for producing metabolites. To understand the functions of miRNAs in D. nobile protocorm, Illumina sequencing of D. nobile protocorm (Dnp), D. officinale protocorm (Dcp), and D. nobile leaf (Dnl) were carried out. A total of 439, 412, and 432 miRNAs were identified from Dnp, Dcp, and Dnl, respectively. Some specific miRNAs were identified among them. Through combing GO and KEGG function annotation, miRNAs mainly involved metabolic pathways, plant hormone signal transduction, biological regulation, and protein binding. Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (AACT), mevalonate kinase (MK), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (HDS), synthesizing basic precursor isoprene pyrophosphate (IPP) in terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway, were predicted as potential targets of 6 different miRNAs. Twenty-six miRNAs participated in auxin, cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid signal transduction pathway. This report provided valuable candidate genes in Dnp involved in terpenoid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction pathway. At the same time, it can help accelerate the use of dendrobine into nano preparation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jieying", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Qingjun", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sarsaiya", "ForeName": "Surendra", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Leilei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jishuang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lanping", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biomed Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101230869", "ISSNLinking": "1550-7033"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "MicroRNAs"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2115-91-5", "NameOfSubstance": "dendrobine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "MicroRNAs"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33875076", "10.1166/jbn.2021.3036"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
