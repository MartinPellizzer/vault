According to the growth characteristics on the medium for activation, thirty strains of Armillaria were classified into 4 clusters. Two strains with good growth indicators were selected from each cluster and cultiva-ted with immature tuber(Mima) and the branches of the broad-leaved trees in a water-controlled box. The results showed that the Armillaria clusters with uniaxial branches of rhizoid cords, such as clusters \u2162 and \u2163, were excellent clusters in symbiosis with G. elata f. glauca. The soil RWC had significant effects on the growth characteristics of Armillaria strains and the seedling survival rate, yield, and individual weight of G. elata f. glauca. The growth characteristics of Armillaria strains and the seedling survival rate, yield, and individual weight of G. elata f. glauca in the case of the soil RWC being 75% were significantly better than those in the case of other soil RWC. Cultivating Mima with elite strains of Armillaria, together with branches of broad-leaved trees, in the greenhouses with the artificial control of the soil RWC, can achieve efficient seedling production and Mima utilization of G. elata f. glauca."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences Kunming 650000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences Kunming 650000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jin-Yu", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Health Industry, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Nanchang 330115, China Yunnan Key Laboratory of Gastrodia and Fungi Symbiotic Biology, Zhaotong University Zhaotong 657000, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Tian-Rui", "Initials": "TR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "chemistry", "metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrodia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Armillaria"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39041078", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20240215.101"]}}]}
