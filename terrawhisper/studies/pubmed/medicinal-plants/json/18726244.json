In addition to this essentially unrestrained collecting, these plants have been heavily impacted by the cutting and the fragmentation of forest formations throughout the country. Considering the limited availability of natural resources, threats to species diversity, and the necessity of conservation efforts in light of the rapid exhaustion of natural ecosystems, it is becoming exceedingly important to establish conservation priorities. The present work sought to identify the native medicinal plants harvested for industrial purposes and to establish conservation priorities for the species of highest commercial value. To that end, a survey of Brazilian industrial products that use medicinal plants was undertaken in 54 shops in the city of Recife (Pernambuco, NE Brazil). The survey noted information concerning the commercial name of the product, its plant composition and pharmaceutical presentation, therapeutic indications, as well as the laboratory that produced it. Only native species were considered. A total of 74 different native species used to produce more than 300 types of products were encountered in the present survey. Twelve species demonstrated significant versatility (Species which had the highest numbers of different therapeutic indications and body systems), and 58.33% of these plants were trees. Destructive collecting predominates (58.11%), greatly affecting taxa collected exclusively from wild populations (86.49%). The intensive use of exclusively wild species and the destructive harvesting techniques employed in gathering them create serious problems that will threaten the availability of these resources to future generations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laborat\u00f3rio de Etnobot\u00e2nica Aplicada, Departamento de Biologia, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco, Rua Dom Manoel de Medeiros, s/n - Dois Irm\u00e3os, CEP 52171-900, Recife, PE, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Melo", "ForeName": "Joabe Gomes", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Amorim", "ForeName": "Elba L\u00facia Cavalcanti", "Initials": "EL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Albuquerque", "ForeName": "Ulysses Paulino", "Initials": "UP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 2007 Sep;132(1-3):189-206", "ArticleIdList": ["17279457"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 2002 Aug 9;297(5583):935-6", "ArticleIdList": ["12171086"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 2007 Feb;125(1-3):281-90", "ArticleIdList": ["17219240"]}, {"Citation": "J Ethnopharmacol. 2006 Apr 21;105(1-2):173-86", "ArticleIdList": ["16298502"]}, {"Citation": "J Ethnopharmacol. 2007 Dec 3;114(3):325-54", "ArticleIdList": ["17900836"]}, {"Citation": "J Ethnopharmacol. 2007 Mar 1;110(1):76-91", "ArticleIdList": ["17056216"]}, {"Citation": "Ambio. 2005 Dec;34(8):607-10", "ArticleIdList": ["16521835"]}, {"Citation": "J Ethnopharmacol. 2007 Aug 15;113(1):156-70", "ArticleIdList": ["17616289"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18726244", "10.1007/s10661-008-0506-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
