Gallic acid is also a potent anti-oxidant phytochemical possessing numerous medicinal potentials against various ailments such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and other life-threatening diseases including malignancy. Present study was aimed to evaluate acute and sub-acute toxicity of gallic acid in albino mice. The primary aim of the study was to investigate gallic acid prompted PPAR-\u03b1/\u03b3 activation associated adverse events. Acute toxicity of gallic acid was determined in albino mice and 28-days sub-acute toxicity study was carried out in male and female albino mice at three dose levels, 100, 300 and 900\u202fmg/kg/day, p.o. LD<sub>50</sub> of gallic acid was found to be greater than 2000\u202fmg/kg in mice. Hematological investigation did not show any alteration in transaminases and other blood homeostasis parameters. Gross necropsy showed non-significant alteration upon gallic acid administration. Histopathological finding suggested no significant alteration in tissue histology with slight fatty cells in bone marrow indicating non-significant bone marrow suppression, also no obvious effect was observed on hematological parameters. High dose of gallic acid (900\u202fmg/kg/day) for 28 days did not produce any significant alteration in morphological and behavioral parameters. Histopathological finding also supports safety of gallic acid in mice."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
