Plant species have specific genes involved in secondary metabolism which allows them to synthesize various compounds with terpene core. These kinds of plant species are also known as herbal drugs and they are primarily used as components in medicinal products or simply as health foods. This chapter will focus on terpene and terpenoid compounds found in selected edible and aromatic plants belonging to several plant families. Selected plant species are briefly discussed. Biologically active compounds with terpene core are most frequently found in essential oils of the edible and aromatic species, as well as they are separately isolated and identified from the extracts. Health beneficial effects coming from terpene compounds found in edible and aromatic plants are further presented and include antimicrobial, antiviral, cytotoxic, anticancer, anti-inflammatory and many other pharmacological activities."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
