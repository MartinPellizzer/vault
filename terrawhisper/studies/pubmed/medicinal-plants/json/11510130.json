Plant biomass declined significantly at concentrations above 60 ppm of Pb. Roots showed more pronounced impact as compared to shoots. At highest applied concentration of lead (100 ppm), fresh weight of fruits decreased by 33% and dry weight by 52% as compared to control. No significant impact was noticed on the development of mycorrhiza at lower concentrations (15-45 ppm) of lead contamination. At higher concentrations of Pb (60 and 75 ppm), there was a decrease in VAM colonization. VAM hyphae had irregular size and terminated abruptly in outer cortex of root. Number of VAM fungal spores in rhizosphere also decreased with increase in the edaphic Pb concentration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Biology Laboratory, Department of Botany, University of Delhi, Delhi 110007, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koul", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kapoor", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luikham", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Symbiosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11510130"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
