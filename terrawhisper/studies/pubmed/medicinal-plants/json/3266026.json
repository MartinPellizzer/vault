K46M is a strong T-cell mitogen, while K3G and 3-19-2 inhibited cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Resting peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) contained 4-16% K46M+ cells, 8-35% K3G+ cells, and less than 0.3-4% 3-19-2+ cells. After stimulation with T-cell mitogens the proportion of K46M+ and 3-19-2+ cells increased markedly (mean 59 and 30% positive cells, respectively), while the increase in K3G+ cells was less prominent (38%). K46M-reactive structures were expressed on mature T cells and probably also on B cells. K3G reacted with B and T cells while 3-19-2 showed a broader specificity reacting also with erythrocytes. All three MoAb reacted with lipid extracts of resting and activated PBL as well as with purified neutral glycolipids of lymphoid origin. In addition 3-19-2 reacted with lipid extracts of erythrocytes. K46M immuno-precipitated four surface peptides from lectin-stimulated PBL. Their apparent molecular weights were 53,000, 42,000, and 16,000 (doublet). The 53,000 and 42,000 MW peptides were identified as the alpha and beta chains of the T-cell antigen receptor. The identity of the 16,000 MW peptides is presently unknown. K3G and 3-19-2 did not specifically precipitate any lymphocyte surface peptide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, University of Ume\u00e5, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Hammarstr\u00f6m", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Berzins", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aguilar-Santelises", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Andersson", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Perlmann", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hammarstr\u00f6m", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Scand J Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "0323767", "ISSNLinking": "0300-9475"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, Surface"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycopeptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "leukoagglutinins, plants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antigen-Antibody Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, Surface"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites, Antibody"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycopeptides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interphase"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3266026", "10.1111/j.1365-3083.1988.tb01510.x"]}}]}
