Viridulum Baker</i>) is a well-known edible plant with large, white and sweet bulb scales that has important medicinal value (Zhou et al. 2021) and is grown mainly in the Hebei, Shanxi and Henan provinces of China. In May 2021, a case of bulb rot was discovered in a 3.33 hm<sup>2</sup> plantation in Huaihua, Hunan Province, affecting 20% of the area (27\u00b059'30\u2033N, 110\u00b032'20\u2033E). The disease is most severe during the rainy season in May and June. In the early stage, irregular brown spots appeared on the lily scales, the necrosis was depressed and gradually enlarges, and in the later stage, the scales were scattered from the base of the disc and slough off. Ten samples were taken randomly from different plants in the plantation area to isolate the pathogens. After washing with sterile water, they were cut into small pieces and sterilised with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 s, 75% ethanol for 90 s, rinsed three times with sterile water and dried on sterile filter paper, then placed on a water agar plate and incubated in the dark in a constant temperature incubator at 28\u2103 for 3 to 5 days. After 2 days, the mycelium at the edge of the colony was transferred to a PDA plate and incubated for 3-5 days at 28\u00b0C in the dark to obtain pure fungal isolates. Eighteen purified fungal isolates were obtained, of which sixteen looked like <i>Fusarium</i> (88.9% isolation rate) and three representative isolates (BHBR2, BHBR3 and BHBR5) were selected for further study. The surface of this fungus was white with dense aerial mycelium. Some had an orange centre in the medium. Microconidia were oval in shape and appeared either straight or slightly curved. These microconidia were colourless, had 0-1 septa and measured 3.334 to 14.724 \u00d7 2.216 to 5.385 \u03bcm (n=100). Macroconidia were predominantly three-septate, crescent-shaped structures that were thin-walled and slightly curved. Cells at the apex and base were similarly curved. Macroconidia measured 17.956 to 32.150 \u00d7 2.788 to 4.492 \u03bcm (n=100). The mitochondrial small subunit (mtSSU) and translation elongation factor 1-\u03b1 (TEF1) genes were amplified and sequenced using the NMS1/NMS2 and TEF-R/TEF-F primers to verify the identity of the pathogens (Stewart et al. 2006). The sequences were submitted to GenBank (BHBR2: mtSSU, PP273435; TEF, OR900976; BHBR3: mtSSU, PP277729; TEF, OR900977; BHBR5: mtSSU, PP277728; TEF, OR900978). A concatenated phylogenetic tree of the two genes was constructed and analysis showed that BHBR2, BHBR3 and BHBR5 were significantly clustered with <i>Fusarium commune</i>. Based on the results of morphological identification and phylogenetic tree analysis, the three isolates were identified as <i>Fusarium commune</i>. We carried out pathogenicity tests using two methods, one in which 6 \u00d7 6 mm fungal blocks were inoculated on lily (<i>L. brownie var. viridulum Baker</i>) scales and controls inoculated with sterile blocks, and the other in which strain BHBR2 was selected to carry out pathogenicity tests on bulbs of live plants soaked with 50 ml of a 1 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> conidial suspension and bulbs of control plants soaked with sterile water, all in three replicates. They were placed in a growth chamber at 28\u00b0C and 80% relative humidity, and the scales were moistened with moistened sterile filter paper. After 3 days of rearing treated scales, lesions appeared on lily scales inoculated with mycelial blocks and expanded with time, whereas no lesions appeared on lily scales inoculated with sterile blocks. One month later, whole plants soaked in the spore suspension wilted, while the control plants grew well. The pathogens re-isolated from the diseased tissues had the same morphological characteristics as representative isolates. This confirms Koch's hypothesis. <i>Fusarium commune</i> has been shown to be the most important pathogenic fungus causing root rot in Alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i>) (Yang et al. 2022) and blueberry (<i>Vaccinium uliginosum L.</i>) (Li et al. 2023) in China. To our knowledge, this is the first report of <i>Fusarium commune</i> causing lily bulb rot in the world, which will lay the foundation for future control of lily bulb rot."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huaihua University, 71205, No.180 Huaidong Road, Huaihua, China, 418000; leisun248@126.com."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huaihua, China; 17573925120@163.com."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Li Guang", "Initials": "LG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huaihua, China; 3264757254@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Jin Qin", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changsha, China; weixiang@hunau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Xiang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huaihua, China; 2287624576@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qi Dong", "Initials": "QD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huaihua, China; 2166439956@qq.com."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Qiong", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huaihua, China; 954184956@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ling Hai", "Initials": "LH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huaihua, China; 2923941946@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Hao Shi", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huaihua, China; 982016748@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "40"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38499974", "10.1094/PDIS-12-23-2588-PDN"]}}]}
