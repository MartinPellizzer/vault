Dopamine and tyramine are oxidized with abstraction of the pro-R hydrogen by the porcine plasma amine oxidase, the pro-S hydrogen by pea seedling amine oxidase and a net nonstereospecific proton abstraction by the bovine plasma enzyme. This provides the first example in which a reaction catalyzed by enzymes in the same formal class occurs by all three possible stereochemical routes. To assess the underlying mechanistic significance of this heterogeneity, we have established the stereochemical course of the oxidation of tyramine by five additional copper amine oxidases using 1H NMR spectroscopy. Reactions catalyzed by rabbit and sheep serum amine oxidases are nonstereospecific. These enzymes exhibit rare mirror image binding with differential flux through two opposite and stereospecific reaction pathways. Differential primary kinetic isotope effects are observed for each mode, 8 and 4.6 for pro-S abstraction and 2.6 and 2.7 for pro-R abstraction by the sheep and rabbit amine oxidases, respectively. Tyramine oxidations catalyzed by the soybean and chick pea amine oxidases and porcine kidney diamine oxidase, however, are all stereospecific, occurring with loss of the pro-S hydrogen at C-1. Solvent exchange profiles are consistent within each stereochemical class of enzyme; the pro-R and nonstereospecific enzymes exchange solvent into C-2 of product aldehydes, the pro-S enzymes do not."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada."}], "LastName": "Coleman", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Scaman", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Y J", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Palcic", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.3.21", "NameOfSubstance": "Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X8ZC7V0OX3", "NameOfSubstance": "Tyramine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tyramine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2016294", "S0021-9258(20)89570-2"]}}]}
