(ASCLEPIDACEAE) is an important Indian medicinal plant. It is called \"ASTHMA KODI\" OR \"NANJARUPPAN\" IN Tamil in the Siddha system of medicine. Tamil medical literature reveal that it is an ideal plant medicine for respiratory problems and is also a cardiac tonic. For medicinal purposes it is collected only from the wild. It has not yet been brought under cultivation. Its taxonomy, morphology, ecology and medicinal uses were studied. Since, tissue-culture is a costly technology and requiring a high-tech laboratory a low-cost mass- multiplication technique has been invented through water-culture experiments, in order to make its saplings available to the interested herbal farmers in a larger scale. The results are reported in this paper, which will be of immense help and use to the herbal farmers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants research Unit, Department of Botany and Microbiology, AVVM Sri Pushpam College (Autonomous), Poondi-613 350., Thanjavur Dt., Tamilnadu, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dhandapani", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balu", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Anc Sci Life", "NlmUniqueID": "8307589", "ISSNLinking": "0257-7941"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22557081", "PMC3331002"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
