During the last twenty-five years (1990-2015), numerous BAs have been prepared. Both natural BAs and their synthetic derivatives can be used to treat various cancers as well as inflammatory diseases. Areas covered: This review covers patents on therapeutic activities of natural BAs and their synthetic derivatives published in last twenty-five years (1990-2015). Only BA patents to treat cancer and inflammation are available. A discussion about structure-activity relationships (SAR) of these analogs is also included. Expert opinion: BAs possess excellent anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties. A large number of BAs and their analogues have been prepared through modification at the C<sub>3</sub>-OH and C<sub>24</sub>-CO<sub>2</sub>H functional groups. Most importantly, the C-24 amide and amino derivatives demonstrated increased anticancer and anti-inflammatory activity compared with other BA derivatives. Furthermore, BAs have the potential to form conjugates with other anticancer drugs that will synergistically enhance their anticancer effects; and we believe that in order to get lead compounds, there needs to be a greater focus on the synthesis of halo derivatives of BAs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a UoN Chair of Oman's Medicinal Plants and Marine Natural Products , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Hidayat", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a UoN Chair of Oman's Medicinal Plants and Marine Natural Products , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Al-Harrasi", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Organische Chemie , Martin-Luther Universit\u00e4t Halle-Wittenberg , Halle , Germany."}], "LastName": "Csuk", "ForeName": "Rene", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a UoN Chair of Oman's Medicinal Plants and Marine Natural Products , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Shamraiz", "ForeName": "Umair", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Chemistry and Polymer Science , University of Stellenbosch , Stellenbosch , South Africa."}], "LastName": "Green", "ForeName": "Ivan R", "Initials": "IR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d DFG Centre for Functional Nanostructures , Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) , Karlsruhe , Germany."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Ishtiaq", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e National Center for Natural Products Research , University of Mississippi , Oxford , MS , USA."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Ikhlas A", "Initials": "IA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e National Center for Natural Products Research , University of Mississippi , Oxford , MS , USA."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Zulfiqar", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Expert Opin Ther Pat", "NlmUniqueID": "9516419", "ISSNLinking": "1354-3776"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "631-69-6", "NameOfSubstance": "boswellic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patents as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27646163", "10.1080/13543776.2017.1235156"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
