The data indicated that most derivatives exhibited equivalent or better protective activity than the positive control (dimethyl dicarboxylate biphenyl, DDB) under the same conditions. Among them, compound 1b showed the most potent hepatoprotective activity against Con A-induced immunological injury. Mechanistic studies in\u00a0vitro revealed that 1b inhibited cell apoptosis and inflammatory responses caused by Con A treatment via IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Consistently, it also exhibited significant hepatoprotective activity in mice with Con A-induced immunological liver injury. These results clearly indicated that 1b might be a highly potent hepatoprotective agent targeting IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.
