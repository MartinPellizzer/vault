Therefore, it is necessary to screen an efficient method to produce CT derivatives. A green and efficient method by using lipase as catalyst to synthesize a series of CT derivatives, was thus proposed. To obtain optimum reaction conditions, the effects of various parameters on conversion rate were firstly evaluated. An in vitro \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory assay of synthesized compounds was then carried out, and the structure-activity relationship of these compounds was conducted. Under the optimum conditions (MTBE, Nu/S: 2/1, E/S: 20/1, 50\u202f\u00b0C and 24\u202fh), the conversion rates of synthesized compounds were above 65 %. The bioassay results indicated that N-trans-caffeoyltyramine and N-trans-feruloyltyramine had potent activities against \u03b1-glucosidase with IC<sub>50</sub> of 30.08\u202f\u03bcM and 31.94\u202f\u03bcM, respectively. The structure-activity relationship results showed that the presence of -OH or -OCH<sub>3</sub> group at C-3 position could boost the activities of CT derivatives. Meanwhile, the presence of -OH group at C-4 position and double bound on caffeoyl moiety as well as the presence of -OH group at C-4' position was essential for the activities of CT derivatives."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
