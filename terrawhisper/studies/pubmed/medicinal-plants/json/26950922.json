The concentrations of the abiotic elicitors MJ and CD were optimized using central composite design (CCD) and quantification of TA and TX in elicited cultures was done by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis.", "It was observed that MJ at a concentration of 0.2 mM showed good increase in content of TX to 0.032% w/w and at concentrations 0.05 mM, 0.1 mM and 0.2 mM showed similar increase in TA content to 0.018% w/w, whereas CD at the concentration of 25 mM showed highest increase in TX content to 0.036% w/w and at the concentrations of 25 mM, 50 mM showed increase in TA content to 0.023% w/w as compared to the plant root (PR) which showed content of TX as 0.0299% w/w and TA as 0.0169% w/w.", "From the present investigation it was concluded that out of the two abiotic elicitors MJ and CD, CD was found to be more effective to increase TA and TX content in Dandelion cell cultures."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.
