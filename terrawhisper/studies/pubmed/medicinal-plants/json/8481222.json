The study was carried out as a comparison of two independent groups each containing 10 male and 10 female healthy volunteers aged between 18 to 60 years (mean: 40.45 +/- 12.2 years). The batteries of performance tests consisted of seven procedures. It was conducted before treatment without alcohol as well as the 1st, 4th and 8th day of treatment together with alcohol. The results showed no negative multiplicative effects caused by the Kava-special extract WS 1490 together with alcohol. With the concentration test however there was a remarkable advantage of the WS 1490 group at the 4th day of treatment (p < 1%). The collection of well-being data as well as the description of adverse events proved WS 1490 to be well tolerated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "TUV Rheinland, Pr\u00fcfstelle f\u00fcr Medikamenteneinfl\u00fcsse auf Verkehrs- und Arbeitssicherheit, K\u00f6ln, Germany."}], "LastName": "Herberg", "ForeName": "K W", "Initials": "KW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"], "VernacularTitle": "Zum Einfluss von Kava-Spezialextrakt WS 1490 in Kombination mit Ethylalkohol auf sicherheitsrelevante Leistungsparameter."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Blutalkohol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372531", "ISSNLinking": "0006-5250"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Attention"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Automobile Driving"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kava"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Psychomotor Performance"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Reaction Time"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8481222"]}}]}
