The sequence length of four new gene were 1 617, 1 461, 1 746, 1 875 bp, and subsequently, named as PhCCD1,PhNCED2,PhNCED3 and PhCCD4 according to its genetic relationship with Arabidopsis thaliana. The sequence analysis showed that four new gene were all containing REP65 domains and binding sites of ferrous ion, such as histidine, glutamates and aspartates. Analysis phylogeny showed that PhNCED2 and PhNCED3 were the cluster of NCEDs, PhCCD1 and PhCCD4 were the cluster of CCDs. In addition, PhCCD1 and AtCDD1 of Arabidopsis thaliana, PhCCD4 and AtCCD4 of A. thaliana,PhNCED2, PhNCED3 and AtNCED3 of A. thaliana have high similarities. Analysis of real-time fluorescence quantitative showed that PhNCED2 and PhNCED3 were expressed mainly in underground part, the expression quantity of PhNCED2 reached the highest in fibrous root, PhNCED3 keeps higher in phloem and xylem, it may be the key enzymes of ABA biosynthesis genes. Moreover,PhCCD1 and PhCCD4 were expressed mainly in aerial part,the expression quantity of PhCCD1 reached the highest in leaf,PhCCD4 keeps higher in stem and leaf.It may be involved in the biosynthesis of carotenoids for P. heterophylla. The study obtained CDDs gene of P. heterophylla for the first time,this would lay the foundation of developing the response mechanism of P. heterophylla about external stress further,and then exploring the biological approach of quality formation in P. heterophylla."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Deng-Kai", "Initials": "DK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Wei-Ke", "Initials": "WK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Carotenoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.13.11.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Dioxygenases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carotenoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Caryophyllaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Dioxygenases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28905560", "10.4268/cjcmm20161306"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
