We aimed to evaluate aging and longevity in Iranian SM-exposed survivors using some endocrine and molecular biomarkers for the first time. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), prolactin (PRL), cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) were measured in 289 male SM-veterans and 66 age-matched males using the ELISA method. Leukocyte Telomere Length (LTL) measurement and p16<sup>INK4a</sup> expression were measured in the peripheral blood leukocytes of 55 males who were exposed to SM. We found a significantly lower serum DHEAS level and higher serum PRL level in SM-exposed groups (without any related to the severity of lung injuries) compared to healthy controls, but no significant difference in serum levels of cortisol, testosterone, and LH. The molar ratio of DHEAS/cortisol was significantly higher in controls compared to the SM-exposed individuals especially those with severe lung damage. Some biological parameters of allostatic load score such as DHEAS and DHEAS/cortisol ratio significantly decreased long-term after the SM exposure. Additionally, we found that LTL was shorter in SM-exposed veterans rather than unexposed controls while p16<sup>INK4a</sup> gene expression significantly increased in these groups. It seems that DHEAS, DHEAS/cortisol ratio, LTL, and p16<sup>INK4a</sup> gene expression have changed significantly in favor of cellular senescence in SM-exposed patients. Therefore, it seems that SM exposure increases biological age compared to chronological age in SM-exposed survivors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ardestani", "ForeName": "Susan K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7380-0215"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunoregulation Research Center, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jamali", "ForeName": "Tahereh", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Mazandaran, Babolsar, Iran."}], "LastName": "Taravati", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Behboudi", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vaez-Mahdavi", "ForeName": "Mohamad-Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunoregulation Research Center, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Faghihzadeh", "ForeName": "Elham", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunoregulation Research Center, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghazanfari", "ForeName": "Tooba", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "T8KEC9FH9P", "NameOfSubstance": "Mustard Gas"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WI4X0X7BPJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocortisone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3XMK78S47O", "NameOfSubstance": "Testosterone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mustard Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocortisone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cellular Senescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Telomere"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Testosterone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36573392", "10.1080/01480545.2022.2150205"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
