In tumour-bearing mice model, lung tumours were reduced in size in mice treated with intraperitoneal injections of leojapone B at 20 and 30\u00a0mg/kg for 14\u00a0days. The population ratio of CD4<sup>+</sup> /CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in mouse spleens was found to be increased, while regulatory T cells were decreased after leojapone B treatment.", "The inhibitory effects of leojapone B in mouse lung tumours were demonstrated for the first time in this study. The immunomodulatory activity of heteronone B were also demonstrated.
