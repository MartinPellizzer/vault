Their structures were determined by spectroscopic analysis including 1D and 2D NMR and HRESIMS experiments. Limoniumin A is the first hybrid lignanamide of phenylpropanoid and coumarin. All tested lignanamides showed significant inhibitory activity against \u03b1-glucosidase stronger than positive control and remarkable inhibitory effect to PTP1B with IC<sub>50</sub> values less than 10\u00a0\u03bcM. In addition, some lignanamides exhibited moderate cytotoxic activity against HeLa and MCF-7\u00a0cells and anti-inflammatory activity against COX-2 in a dose-dependent way."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
