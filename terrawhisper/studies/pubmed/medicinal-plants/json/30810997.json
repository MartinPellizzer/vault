Overall, 412 crude cell extracts were tested against Candida albicans using disk diffusion assays, with 42% (43/103) of the strains showing the ability to produce antifungal agents. Also, extracts inhibited growth of important human pathogens: Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida glabrata. Based on the established degree and range of antifungal activity, nine isolates, confirmed as streptomycetes by 16S rRNA sequencing, were selected for further testing. Their ability to inhibit Candida growth in liquid culture, to inhibit biofilm formation, and to disperse pre-formed biofilms was assessed with active concentrations from 8 to 250\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. High-performance liquid chromatographic profiles of extracts derived from selected strains were recorded, revealing moderate metabolic diversity. Our results proved that rhizosphere soil of ethno-medicinal plants is a prolific source of streptomycetes, producers of potentially new antifungal compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Vojvode Stepe 444a, Belgrade, 11000, Serbia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Faculty of Technology, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Mojicevic", "ForeName": "Marija", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biosystems Chemistry, Department of Chemistry and Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPSM), Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany."}], "LastName": "D'Agostino", "ForeName": "Paul M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Vojvode Stepe 444a, Belgrade, 11000, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Nikodinovic-Runic", "ForeName": "Jasmina", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Vojvode Stepe 444a, Belgrade, 11000, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Vasiljevic", "ForeName": "Branka", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biosystems Chemistry, Department of Chemistry and Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPSM), Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany."}], "LastName": "Gulder", "ForeName": "Tobias A M", "Initials": "TAM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5083-4287"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Vojvode Stepe 444a, Belgrade, 11000, Serbia. sandravojnovic@imgge.bg.ac.rs."}], "LastName": "Vojnovic", "ForeName": "Sandra", "Initials": "S"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "173048", "Agency": "Ministarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnolo?kog Razvoja", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "Bilateral Project with Republic of Serbia to J Nikodinovi?-Runic and TAM Gulder ? 2016/2017", "Agency": "Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "GU 1233/1-1", "Agency": "Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9816585", "ISSNLinking": "1139-6709"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Bacterial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Ribosomal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Candida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cluster Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Ribosomal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhizosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis, DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Serbia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Streptomyces"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30810997", "10.1007/s10123-019-00054-8", "10.1007/s10123-019-00054-8"]}}]}
