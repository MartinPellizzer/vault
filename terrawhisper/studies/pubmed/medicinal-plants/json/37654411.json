Natural materials generated from medicinal plants have been identified, and their therapeutic potential evaluation has resulted in the development of novel, affordable medicines that can be used to treat a variety of illnesses, including chronic wounds, with limited side effects.", "This study aimed to assess the wound-healing property of Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Athimathuram) plant extracts by using an <i>in vitro</i> scratch assay test, as well as to evaluate their cellular toxicity.", "Using the Soxhlet device, ethanolic extraction of the plant material was done, and the cytotoxicity of the extract on the Vero cell line was examined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. One of the most often utilized mammalian <i>in vitro</i> cell lines in research was Vero cells. To assess the wound healing properties of G. glabra plant extract, an <i>in vitro</i> scratch assay was used, and their potential mechanisms of action were examined.", "Even at higher concentrations, the MTT assay showed that G. Glabra plant extracts had no cytotoxic effects on the cells. <i>In vitro</i> scratch assay showed that the healing process of the cell line was increased by 23.33% when compared with the controlled cell lines.", "Our research demonstrated that G. glabra has <i>in vitro</i> wound healing capabilities. As a result, G. glabra can be suggested as a possible source of compounds that treat wounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2023 Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology, SRM Kattankulathur Dental College and Hospital, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Potheri, Chengalpet Dt., Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Roy", "ForeName": "Ishika", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology, SRM Kattankulathur Dental College and Hospital, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Potheri, Chengalpet Dt, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Magesh", "ForeName": "Karuppur Thiagarajan", "Initials": "KT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology, SRM Kattankulathur Dental College and Hospital, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Potheri, Chengalpet Dt, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Sathyakumar", "ForeName": "Mayilvakanam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology, SRM Kattankulathur Dental College and Hospital, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Potheri, Chengalpet Dt, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Sivachandran", "ForeName": "Annamalai", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, SRM Kattankulathur Dental College and Hospital, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Potheri, Chengalpet Dt, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Purushothaman", "ForeName": "Deenadayalan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology, SRM Kattankulathur Dental College and Hospital, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Potheri, Chengalpet Dt, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Aravindhan", "ForeName": "Ravi", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Bioallied Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101537209", "ISSNLinking": "0975-7406"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Tyavambiza C, Dube P, Goboza M, Meyer S, Madiehe AM, Meyer M.
