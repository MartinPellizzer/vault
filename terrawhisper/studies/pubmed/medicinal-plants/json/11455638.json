The compounds tested were a pyrazoline adduct (2) of parthenin, its cyclopropyl (3) and propenyl (4) derivatives, anhydroparthenin (5), a dihydro-deoxygenated product (6), a formate (7) and its corresponding alcohol (8) and acetate (9), a rearranged product (10), lactone (11) and hemiacetal (12). All these derivatives, along with parthenin, were tried for their antifeedant action against sixth-instar larvae of Spodoptera litura, for insecticidal activity against the adults of store grain pest Callosobruchus maculatus, for phytotoxic activity against Cassia tora, and for nematicidal activity against the juvenile stage-II (J2) of the root knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. Antifeedent bioassay revealed that parthenin is moderately antifeedant. Among the derivatives, the saturated lactone (11) was found to be about 2.25 times more active than parthenin. The pyrazoline adduct (2) was found to be the most effective as an insecticide, with LC50 values after 24, 48 and 72 h of 96, 43 and 32 mg litre-1, respectively, which are comparable with neem extract. Compound 4 was found to be the most effective inhibitor of germination and seedling growth of C tora, with ID50 values for germination, plumule length and radicle length of 136, 326 and 172 compared with 364, 738 and 427 mg litre-1, respectively, for parthenin. Compound 10 was found to be the most effective in terms of nematicidal activity. The LC50 values for this compound were 273 and 104 mg litre-1, respectively, after 48 and 72 h compared with 862 and 512 mg litre-1 observed for parthenin after 48 and 72 h."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Agricultural Chemicals, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi-110 012, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Datta", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saxena", "ForeName": "D B", "Initials": "DB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pest Manag Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "100898744", "ISSNLinking": "1526-498X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antinematodal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Limonins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Uncoupling Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "982DJP4W6A", "NameOfSubstance": "parthenin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O4U1SAF85H", "NameOfSubstance": "azadirachtin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antinematodal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Coleoptera"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Feeding Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactones"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lepidoptera"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limonins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nematoda"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Rosales"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tanacetum parthenium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Uncoupling Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11455638", "10.1002/1526-4998(200101)57:1<95::AID-PS248>3.0.CO;2-J"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
