(STG) has been used as a folk medicine for the treatment of different cancers, especially for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, cervical cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, lung cancer and leukemia in China. However, the main chemical composition and anticancer mechanism of chloroform extract of STG (CESTG) were still not very clear.", "This work was carried out to investigate the anticancer effects and mechanisms of chloroform extract of STG (CESTG) on NPC.", "Cultured NPC CNE1, CNE2 and Np69\u00a0cells were treated with CESTG. Cells were subjected to cell proliferation, colony-forming, migration and invasion assays. Cell cycle and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry. Western blotting and morphological analysis were also performed. Tumor xenografts and drug treatments were made in BALB/c nude mice. The main compounds of CESTG was separated by HPLC.", "CESTG inhibited cell viability, clonal growth and induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner by silencing the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is associated with upregulation of cleaved PARP, caspase 3/7/8/9, cleaved caspase 3/7/8/9, Bax and downregulation of PARP, P-PI3K, PI3K, P-AKT, AKT, P-mTOR, mTOR and Bcl-2. In addition, CESTG arrested cell cycle in the G1/S phase, correlating with decreased levels of cyclin D1/B1, CDK 4 and 6. CESTG decreased cell migration and invasion which correlated with decreased expression of \u03b2-catenin, vimentin and snail. CESTG significantly inhibited the tumor growth without toxicity.", "The results presented here suggest that CESTG could be use as a potential source of NPC therapeutic drug."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).
