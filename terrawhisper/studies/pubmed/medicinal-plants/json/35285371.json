Due to their beneficial constituents, they are classified as functional foods. This study focuses on the chemical composition and biological activities of a wild edible mushroom, <i>Morchella steppicola</i> Zerova. The metal composition of this species reveals high levels of biogenic elements. However, according to the levels of iron and cobalt, and calculated health risk indices, this mushroom can be recommended for occasional consumption. Also, <i>M. steppicola</i> is found to be rich in gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and vanillic acid. Statistical analysis showed that mainly 4-hydroxybenzoic and vanillic acids are responsible for both antioxidant and inhibition of enzymes \u03b1-amylase and tyrosinase. Presented work acknowledges the fact that this mushroom has significant potential to be used for the treatment of several human disorders, similarly to other members of this genus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5094-2520"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Afyonkarahisar Health Sciences University, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Sarikurkcu", "ForeName": "Cengiz", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5921-0027"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mathematics and Science Education, Faculty of Education, Mugla Sitki Kocman University, K\u00f6tekli, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Halil Solak", "ForeName": "Mehmet", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7581-7686"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Czech Advanced Technology and Research Institute, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czechia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of the Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Department of Genetic Resources for Vegetables, Medicinal and Special Plants, Crop Research Institute, Olomouc, Czechia."}], "LastName": "Tarkowski", "ForeName": "Petr", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8534-3146"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Czech Advanced Technology and Research Institute, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czechia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of the Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Department of Genetic Resources for Vegetables, Medicinal and Special Plants, Crop Research Institute, Olomouc, Czechia."}], "LastName": "\u0106avar Zeljkovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Sanja", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Morchella steppicola"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Agaricales"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ascomycota"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "41"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35285371", "10.1080/14786419.2022.2050910"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
