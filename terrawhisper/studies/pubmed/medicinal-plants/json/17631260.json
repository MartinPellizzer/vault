About 88% of all subjects reported an improvement in their emotional outlook.", "The role of placebo and its influence on the study's key features: focus shift from physical pain to emotional outlook, and the importance of the client-practitioner relationship and belief in the therapy.", "The use of Bach flower remedies has brought about positive emotional changes in the majority of clients in this study. Whilst it is difficult to draw a definitive conclusion as to significance of the therapeutic value of these remedies in relation to pain above that of a placebo, the results are encouraging. In particular, relief of negative emotions and promotion of positive thought including how clients opened up about, and dealt with, emotional issues. The indication is that potential for Bach flower remedies as a therapeutic agent in the relief of pain does exist and is worthy of further qualitative and quantitative investigation through robust, purpose-designed studies to replicate and progress the results shown here."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Bach Centre, Mount Vernon, Sotwell, Wallingford, Oxon OX10 0PZ, England, UK. judy@bachcentre.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Howard", "ForeName": "Judy", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Complement Ther Clin Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "101225531", "ISSNLinking": "1744-3881"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "England"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["education", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patient Satisfaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Placebo Effect"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Students, Health Occupations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17631260", "10.1016/j.ctcp.2007.03.001", "S1744-3881(07)00005-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
