MS(1)-MS(3)/MS(4) spectra of the both modes were analyzed, and they all gave fragments in line and shared common fragmentation patterns. Key fragments from MS(n) spectra of both the modes and their proposed fragmentation pathways were constructed with examples illustrated for the formation of characteristic fragments in the saponins. Two special fragmentation patterns were proposed: (1) the formation of fragments by cleavage of CH(2)O from Delta(12)-14alpha-CH(2)OH of the oleanene-type saponin aglycone in both positive and negative MS(n) (n > or = 2) modes; (2) the occurrence of fragments by cleavage of CO(2) and 3-glucose as the characteristic structure feature of 23-COOH at the oleanene-type saponin aglycones coupled with 3-Glc substitutes in the negative MS(n) (n > or = 2) modes. Peak intensities in MS(n) spectra were also correlated with structural features and fragmentation preferences of the investigated saponins, which are discussed in detail. In general, fragments formed predominantly by cleavages of glycosidic bonds in the positive mode, while selective cleavages of acyl bonds preceded that of glycosidic bonds in negative MS(n) (n > or = 2) mode, both of which could well be applied to the structural analysis of these saponins. Interpretation of MS(n) spectra presented here provided diagnostic key fragment ions important for the structural elucidation of saponins in P.tenuifolia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jiangyun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xuedong", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Jiuming", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Lizhen", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Shilin", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "9504818", "ISSNLinking": "1076-5174"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polygala"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17554809", "10.1002/jms.1210"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
