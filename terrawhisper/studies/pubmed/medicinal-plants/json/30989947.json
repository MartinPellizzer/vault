The ITS2 and psbA-trnH regions were amplified and sequenced bi-directionally. The Codon Code Aligner V 7. 0. 1 was used to proofread and assemble the contigs and generated consensus sequences. All the sequences were submitted to Traditional Chinese Medicine DNA Barcode Database and NCBI Gen Bank to get information of the species identifications. If the maximum similarity of the identification result is \u2265 97%,exact species can be known. If it is between 97% and 90%,samples' genus can be confirmed; If it is <90%,then we can only confirm its family. Finally there are 17 samples can be identified to species level,5 can be identified to genus level and 1 can be identified to family level. This shows that DNA barcoding used in medicinal plants molecular identification,can identify unknown species rapidly and accurately."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Resources Conservation and Development of Southern Medicine,Hainan Branch of the Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Haikou 570311,China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Xin-Yun", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing for Identification and Safe Evaluation of Chinese Medicine,Institute of Chinese Meteria Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing for Identification and Safe Evaluation of Chinese Medicine,Institute of Chinese Meteria Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing for Identification and Safe Evaluation of Chinese Medicine,Institute of Chinese Meteria Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Xiang-Xiao", "Initials": "XX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing for Identification and Safe Evaluation of Chinese Medicine,Institute of Chinese Meteria Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Yu-Hua", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing for Identification and Safe Evaluation of Chinese Medicine,Institute of Chinese Meteria Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Lan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics,Dongzhimen Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Li-Li", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Resources Conservation and Development of Southern Medicine,Hainan Branch of the Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Haikou 570311,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wei-Jie", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Resources Conservation and Development of Southern Medicine,Hainan Branch of the Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Haikou 570311,China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Xi-Long", "Initials": "XL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis, DNA"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30989947", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20181106.002"]}}]}
