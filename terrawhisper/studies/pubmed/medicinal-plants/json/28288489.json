The rats were pretreated for 8 consecutive days with breviscapine injection (20\u2009mg/kg/day, i.\u2009v.), followed by administration of simvastatin through gavage (40\u2009mg/kg). The control rats received the corresponding volume of saline solution for the pretreatment. Blood samples were collected at varied time points after simvastatin administration and the liver was harvested after the last collection of the blood sample for measurement of the CYP3A4 mRNA expression. Pre-treatment with breviscapine injection led to increased plasma concentration of simvastatin, showing 57% increase for AUC<sub>0-\u221e</sub> (P<0.01)<sub>,</sub> 31% increase for C <sub>max</sub> (P<0.01), and 36% decrease for the total plasma clearance, compared with the control. Pre-treatment with breviscapine injection also inhibited the mRNA expression of the hepatic CYP3A4. These findings indicate that pre-treatment with breviscapine injection could increase the plasma concentration of simvastatin, possibly by inhibiting the expression of the hepatic CYP3A4, and combined use of breviscapine with simvastatin may improve the simvastatin efficacy and reduce its adverse reactions through reduced its dosage."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Harbin, China."}], "LastName": "Ju", "ForeName": "Aixia", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Harbin, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yang Yang", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Harbin, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Zhe", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Harbin, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qiuhong", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Drug Res (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101602406", "ISSNLinking": "2194-9379"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "116122-36-2", "NameOfSubstance": "breviscapine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AGG2FN16EV", "NameOfSubstance": "Simvastatin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyp3a2 protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Area Under Curve"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Herb-Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Simvastatin"}], "CoiStatement": "Conflict of Interest: The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28288489", "10.1055/s-0042-118170"]}}]}
