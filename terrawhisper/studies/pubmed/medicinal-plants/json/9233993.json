The transcriptionally inactive and late-replicating heterochromatin regions proved to be hypoacetylated at lysine positions 5, 8 and 12. The remaining chromatin showed average fluorescence. These patterns were altered when deacetylase was blocked by exposure of root tip meristems to trichostatin A for more than 2 h prior to fixation. Under these conditions, all lysine positions, except lysine 8, appeared to be hyperacetylated at the NOR and in addition at the prominent heterochromatin domains. This observation represents a hitherto unique switch of histone acetylation pattern during the cell cycle. This is apparently caused by deposition of acetylated H4. Ac5, 12 and 16 or by acetylation directly after replication, which later on becomes reduced (H4.Ac16) or even reversed (H4.Ac5 and 12) by deacetylase before cells enter mitosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chromatin and Gene Expression Group, Department of Anatomy, Medical School, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK."}], "LastName": "Belyaev", "ForeName": "N D", "Initials": "ND"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Houben", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Baranczewski", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schubert", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Chromosoma", "NlmUniqueID": "2985138R", "ISSNLinking": "0009-5915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Histones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibody Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Histones"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nucleolus Organizer Region"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9233993", "10.1007/s004120050239"]}}]}
