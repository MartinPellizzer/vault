We show that manipulation of the SlDREB3 gene in tomato alters ABA responses and thereby sensitivity of stomatal closure to ABA. SlDREB3 suppression lines show ABA hypersensitivity and rapid stomatal closure in response to ABA while over-expression lines show reduced sensitivity to ABA and open stomata even at high ABA levels with rapid water loss after 10 days of water stress. This is accompanied with high ROS levels and increased membrane damage due to senescence of leaves and drastically reduced survival in drought. The relative water content (RWC) of OEx lines is much reduced even when grown under well-watered conditions. In contrast, suppression lines show greater tolerance to water stress and almost complete survival to 10-day water stress. They show much reduced ROS levels, reduced membrane damage, higher RWC and reduced leaf water loss. These changes are associated with higher expression of ABA signalling pathway genes in suppression lines while these are highly reduced in OEx lines. The studies suggest that control of ABA signalling by SlDREB3 can help in withstanding severe drought."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
