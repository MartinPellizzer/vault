The results show that aqueous enzymatic extraction of deer oil not only has a high extraction yield and has a small effect on the content of active ingredients. Deer oil can reduce total stomach injury. Without affecting the blood lipid level, it can reduce the oxidative stress, which is manifested by reducing the content of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and enhancing the activity level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). It also enhances the expression of defense factors prostaglandin (E2), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and somatostatin (SS), it inhibits apoptosis evidenced by the enhanced of Bcl-2 and decreased expression of cleavage of caspase-3 and Bax. At the same time, it reduces inflammation, which is manifested by reducing the expression of IL-1\u03b2, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) gastric tissue pro-inflammatory cytokines, and enhancing the expression of anti-inflammatory factors IL-4 and IL-10, and inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase/nuclear factor kappa B (MAPK/NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway in gastric tissue."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Xia, Sun, Liu, Li, Ren, Mu, Zhang, Bo, Zhao and Wang."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Yun-Shi", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Yin-Shi", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Engineering, Changchun University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chang", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhi-Man", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Duo-Duo", "Initials": "DD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Mu", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yan-Ting", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Bo", "ForeName": "Pan-Pan", "Initials": "PP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Li-Juan", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zi", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Front Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "101642264", "ISSNLinking": "2296-861X"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Chen W, Wu D, Jin Y, Li Q, Liu Y, Qiao X, et al. .
