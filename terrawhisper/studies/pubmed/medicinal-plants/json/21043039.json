In the case of pharmaceutical compounds, not only the extraction procedure but also the analysis method should be efficient, precise, fast and easy.", "The essential pharmaceutical characteristics and trace concentration of withanolides led us to modify and optimise the previously reported extraction and quantification procedure for withaferin A (WA) as a candidate for withanolides.", "The WA from the air-dried aerial part of Withania somnifera Dunal. was extracted using a microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) technique. Four variables affecting the extraction procedure were optimised using the central composite design approach. The method of high-performance thin-layer chromatography assay was validated and applied for the quantification of each experiment.", "The optimum values of factors were: extraction time (150\u2009s), extraction temperature (68\u00b0C) and 17\u2009mL of methanol\u2009:\u2009water in the ratio 25\u2009:\u200975 as extracting solvent. The solvent system consisted of ethyl acetate\u2009:\u2009toluene\u2009:\u2009formic acid\u2009:\u20092-propanol (7.0\u2009:\u20092.0\u2009:\u20090.5\u2009:\u20090.5, v/v/v/v), and densitometric scanning at 220\u2009nm was applied for the analysis. The dynamic linear range, LOD, LOQ and recovery with the inter-day, and intra-day RSDs of the developed method indicated the validity of the method.", "A pressurised MAE method for extracting WA from the plant's aerial part was optimised using factorial-based design. The net effect of time, temperature, solvent volume and its ratio suggests that the yield of WA increases until each factor reaches its optimum value, and decreases with further increase in temperature or solvent ratio."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mirzajani", "ForeName": "Fateme", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghassempour", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jalali-Heravi", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mirjalili", "ForeName": "Mohammad Hossein", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochem Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "9200492", "ISSNLinking": "0958-0344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Withanolides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L6DO3QW4K5", "NameOfSubstance": "withaferin A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Densitometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microwaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Software"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Withania"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Withanolides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21043039", "10.1002/pca.1230"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
