Diets were offered 2 weeks before and 2 weeks following DMBA treatment (25 mg/kg body wt). An additional group was fed the 2% garlic powder diet throughout the 20 week study. Although food intake and weight gain were not influenced, dietary garlic powder supplementation did significantly delay the onset of first tumors (P < 0.01) and did reduce the final mammary tumor incidence (P < 0.01). Consumption of garlic powder also significantly depressed the in vivo binding of DMBA to mammary cell DNA. Binding of both anti- and syn-dihydrodiol epoxides to DNA was depressed in rats fed supplemental garlic powder. The activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) in mammary and liver tissue from rats fed 2% dietary garlic powder was higher than observed in tissues from rats fed the basal diet. No further increase in GST activity occurred when the dietary garlic content was increased from 2 to 4%. Final mammary tumor incidence was found to correlate positively with total DMBA-DNA binding and the quantities of individual DMBA-DNA adducts. The present studies demonstrate that garlic powder is effective in inhibiting DMBA-induced mammary tumors, possibly by reducing DMBA-DNA binding."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition, Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "R I", "Initials": "RI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Milner", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA 44567", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Carcinogenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8008055", "ISSNLinking": "0143-3334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-DNA adduct"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Adducts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-97-6", "NameOfSubstance": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Adducts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mammary Glands, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1423843", "10.1093/carcin/13.10.1847"]}}]}
