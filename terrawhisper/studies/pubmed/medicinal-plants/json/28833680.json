Nowadays, it is a well-known spice that possesses worth pharmacological effects. However, some relevant articles have revealed negative impacts of licorice in health. By considering the great wishes in using herbal medicine, it is important to show adverse effects of herbal medicine in health. At present, there are misunderstandings toward the safety of herbal medicines. Herein, we gathered scientific research projects on the toxicity effects of licorice and glycyrrhizin to highlight their safety. In this regards, we categorized our findings about the toxicity effects of licorice and glycyrrhizin in acute, sub-acute, sub-chronic, and chronic states. Besides, we discussed on the cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity of licorice and glycyrrhizin as well as their developmental toxicity. This review disclosed that G. glabra and glycyrrhizin salts are moderately toxic. They need to be used with caution during pregnancy. G. glabra and glycyrrhizin possess selective cytotoxic effects on cancerous cells. The most important side effects of licorice and glycyrrhizin are hypertension and hypokalemic-induced secondary disorders. Licorice side effects are increased by hypokalemia, prolonged gastrointestinal transient time, decreased type 2 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities, hypertension, anorexia nervosa, old age, and female sex.
