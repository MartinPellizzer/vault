Pattern recognition technique may assist the manufacturers to achieve this purpose and effectively control the quality of their products. In this work, a widely used method in chemometrics, orthogonal projection (OP) technique, was applied to discrimination analysis and identification of fingerprints of the herbal medicine houttuynia cordata Thunb. (HCT) and its final injection products. The advantages of the OP technique are clearly shown after comparing with the conventional methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), Mahalanobis distance (MD), and similarity comparison method (SCM). Three different sources of medicinal material HCT and its final injection products from six different manufacturers were studied under 'sixfold', 'threefold' and 'threefold-bis' cross-validation procedures. The good performance of the proposed method in determination and identification of unknown samples shows it could be a powerful tool for quality control in herbal medicine production and other related research fields."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Research Center of Modernization of Chinese Medicines, Central South University, Changsha, 410083, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Zhong-Da", "Initials": "ZD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Yi-Zeng", "Initials": "YZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chau", "ForeName": "Foo-Tim", "Initials": "FT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ya-Li", "Initials": "YL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Anal Bioanal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101134327", "ISSNLinking": "1618-2642"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry Techniques, Analytical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cluster Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Houttuynia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Principal Component Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16622674", "10.1007/s00216-006-0405-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
