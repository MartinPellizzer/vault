Data was obtained from the cross-sectional National Health Survey 2013 (NHS), which had 145,580 adults aged 18 or over were interviewed. The outcome was the use of any ICP over the last 12 months and independent variables were macro-region, sex, age, educational attainment, skin color/race, and chronic disease. The results show that the prevalence of ICPs use in Brazil was 4.1%, while the most used types were medicinal plants and phytotherapy (2.5%), acupuncture (0.9%) and homeopathy (0.6%). The prevalence of ICPs use was higher in the North Region, among older people, women, participants with higher educational attainment, and with a higher number of chronic diseases. The findings from the current study provide valuable evidence that can inform future evidence-based public policies in Brazil."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
