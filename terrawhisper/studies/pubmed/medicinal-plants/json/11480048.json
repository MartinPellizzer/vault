The healthy persons (n = 14) with the same habit and the normal controls without the habit (n = 44) were studied at the same time. The results showed that the frequency of SCEs in the first two groups were obviously higher than that in the last one (P < 0.001). The frequency of SCEs in the patients were also higher than that of the healthy persons with the habit (P < 0.001). These suggest that there are some substances in the areca nuts which can induce the mutation and/or malignant transformation of cells. The habit of chewing areca nuts might seriously disturb the stability of chromosome. OSF is a precancer condition. The occurrence of it perhaps has some hereditary background or genetic susceptibility."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Stomatology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Hunan Medical University."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Hua Xi Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "9422648", "ISSNLinking": "1000-1182"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Oral Submucous Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sister Chromatid Exchange"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11480048"]}}]}
