Removal of glucose residue at position 29 of chikusetsusaponin V by partial hydrolysis increased the activity more than 30-fold. Methylation of the carboxyl group at position 28 increased the activity furthermore by about 10-fold, showing HD50 value of 3.77 microM. On the other hand, removal of the sugar chain at position 3 of chickusetsusaponin V by partial hydrolysis completely lost the activity. These facts suggest that the sugar chain at position 3 of oleanolic acid is essential but that at position 29 is pernicious for the activity. The cytolytic agents, whose target has been regarded as membrane cholesterol, were inactivated not only by cholesterol but also by sapogenins such as oleanolic acid, gitogenin and hederagenin. Among saponins tested, akebia saponin B and C were inactivated by cholesterol, but not by the genins, probably because their affinities for the genins are too low to form complexes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hase", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kobashi", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mitsui", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Namba", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yoshizaki", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tomimori", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Pharmacobiodyn", "NlmUniqueID": "7901854", "ISSNLinking": "0386-846X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sapogenins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SMK8R7TGJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sapogenins"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7328484", "10.1248/bpb1978.4.833"]}}]}
