The objective of this research was to elucidate the molecular pharmacological activity and the effective components in the ethanol extract of GT. We found that GT had potent anti-inflammatory effects on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated murine macrophages, RAW264.7. GT downregulated LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by blocking its transcription. GT also caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the release of prostaglandin E(2) by repressing the promoter activity of the inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) gene. Moreover, GT exerted a dose-dependent inhibition of the LPS-stimulated release of the proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-12. To determine the mechanism by which GT inhibits LPS signaling, we focused on nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation. Western blot analysis revealed that GT abolished LPS-induced inhibitor-kappa B phosphorylation. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that GT abolished LPS-mediated kappa B DNA binding activity. Moreover, macrophages were transfected with a vector coding for the luciferase reporter gene under the control of NF-kappa B cis-acting elements, and the transfected macrophages showed that the LPS-stimulated luciferase activity was GT-sensitive. These results suggest that GT attenuates inflammatory mediator synthesis of activated macrophages through an NF-kappa B-dependent pathway. The active components of GT were identified as oleanolic acid and luteolin-7-glucoside. Both of these compounds inhibited LPS-stimulated inflammatory mediator production and NF-kappa B activation. We conclude that GT inhibits NF-kappa B-mediated gene expression and downregulates inflammatory mediator production in murine macrophages."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2004 National Science Council, ROC and S.
