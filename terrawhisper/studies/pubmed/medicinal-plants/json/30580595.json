Mal\u00fd) Murb., an endemic species of southeastern Dinaric Alps was performed for the first time. The phenolic composition measured via UHPLC-MS/MS of four extract with different polarity suggested this plant species is very rich in both phenolic acids and flavonoids. Ethanol extract was chemically the most versatile containing 12 compounds with quercitrin and rosmarinic acid as the majors, while water extracts were rich in 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, salicylic acid, morin, and apigenin. All extracts showed high antioxidant potential measured spectrophotometrically with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging 0.139 - 0.021\u2009mg/mL. Antimicrobial testing using agar diffusion test showed that ethanol extract was the most potent against all tested organisms. Also, these activities are correlated with the content of phenolic compounds, which suggest they are active ingredients of the extracts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Plant Physiology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina."}], "LastName": "Karalija", "ForeName": "Erna", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Plant Physiology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina."}], "LastName": "Pari\u0107", "ForeName": "Adisa", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Plant Physiology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina."}], "LastName": "Dahija", "ForeName": "Sabina", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Microbiology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina."}], "LastName": "Be\u0161ta-Gajevi\u0107", "ForeName": "Renata", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of the Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Department of Genetic Resources for Vegetables, Medicinal and Special Plants, Crop Research Institute, Olomouc, Czech Republic."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of the Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Central Laboratories and Research Support Faculty of Science, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "\u0106avar Zeljkovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Sanja", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2Y8906LC5P", "NameOfSubstance": "quercitrin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7V515PI7F6", "NameOfSubstance": "Apigenin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8NFQ3F76WR", "NameOfSubstance": "morin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Apigenin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Verbascum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30580595", "10.1080/14786419.2018.1538221"]}}]}
