Effective resistance detection techniques could alleviate treatment cost and mortality associated with this crisis. In this review, the conventional and modern analysis methods for monitoring of drug resistance are presented. Also, various types of emerging rapid and sensitive techniques including electrochemical, electrical, optical and nano-based methods for the screening of drug resistance were discussed. Applications of various methods for the sensitive and rapid detection of drug resistance are investigated. The review outlines existing key issues in the determination which must be overcome before any of these techniques becomes a feasible method for the rapid detection of drug resistance. In this review, the roles of nanomaterials on development of novel methods for the monitoring of drug resistance were presented. Also, limitations and challenges of conventional and modern methods were discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
