Upregulation of Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a negative regulator of insulin signalling, has been well studied as a key regulator in prognosis to insulin resistance. It has been widely studied as a desirable molecular therapeutic target. The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of leaf extract of the medicinal plants Silybum marianum on the inhibition of PTP1B activity. It also explored the synergistic effect with extracts of Gymnema sylvestre (leaves), Momordica charantia (seeds), and Trigonella foenum graecum (seeds). The S. marianum leaves showed dose-dependent inhibition of PTP1B ranging from 9.48-47.95% (25-1000\u2009\u03bcg mL-1). Assay with individual plant extracts showed comparatively lesser inhibition of PTP1B as compared to metformin as a control (38% inhibition). However, a synergistic effect showed nearly 45% PTP1B inhibition (higher than metformin) after the assay was done with selected four plant extracts in combination. The effect of leaf extracts of S. marianum was studied for glucose uptake efficiency in yeast cell lines which was found to be increased by 23% as compared to the control (without extract). Metformin improves glucose upake by yeast cells by ~15-31%. GC-MS analysis revealed 23 phytochemicals, some of which possessed anti-diabetic properties. A dose-dependent increase in antioxidant activity of S. marianum leaves extracts was observed (40-53%). The findings of the study highlighted the presence of various phytochemicals in leaves extracts that are effective against PTP1B inhibition and may help in reinvigorating drug development."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Environmental Sciences, Amity University, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Rath", "ForeName": "Prangya", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Herbal Research and Studies, Amity University Noida, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Prakash", "ForeName": "Dhan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2592-9716"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Biology and Biotechnology, Southern Federal University, Rostov-on-Don, Russia."}], "LastName": "Ranjan", "ForeName": "Anuj", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Environmental Toxicology, Safety and Management, Amity University, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Chauhan", "ForeName": "Abhishek", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Environmental Toxicology, Safety and Management, Amity University, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Jindal", "ForeName": "Tanu", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Consultant Family Medicine, Ministry of Health, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alamri", "ForeName": "Sultan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Family and Community Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine in Rabigh, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alamri", "ForeName": "Turki", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Yousef Abdul Lateef Jameel Chair of Prophetic Medicine Application, Faculty of Medicine, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Harakeh", "ForeName": "Steve", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research and Scientific Studies Unit, College of Nursing and Allied Health Sciences, Jazan University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Haque", "ForeName": "Shafiul", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Genet Eng Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "8510274", "ISSNLinking": "0264-8725"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36641593", "10.1080/02648725.2022.2162236"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
