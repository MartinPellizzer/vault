Numerous topical treatments have been proposed, yet few have been studied experimentally. The present study was designed to examine the comparative efficacy of recommended treatments. Hair on the hind legs of rats was removed and 48 hours later 70% HF was applied. Calcium gluconate, Zephiran (benzalkonium chloride), A + D Ointment, aloe gel, and magnesium ointment were applied topically and burn development was monitored. Calcium gluconate significantly reduced burn size as early as one hour after application. Significant protection continued for seven days after the single application. The other treatments were not effective in decreasing or delaying HF burn development. The results indicated that calcium gluconate ointment was the most effective topical treatment for HF burns."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bracken", "ForeName": "W M", "Initials": "WM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cuppage", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "McLaury", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kirwin", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Klaassen", "ForeName": "C D", "Initials": "CD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Occup Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7502807", "ISSNLinking": "0096-1736"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzalkonium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ointments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11103-57-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-16-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin D"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3A3U0GI71G", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7487-88-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium Sulfate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RGL5YE86CZ", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrofluoric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SQE6VB453K", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Gluconate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aloe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Benzalkonium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Burns, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Gluconate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "First Aid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gels"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrofluoric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium Sulfate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ointments"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["injuries"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin D"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4067676"]}}]}
