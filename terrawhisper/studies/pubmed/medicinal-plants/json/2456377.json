The various names proposed for these lesions reflect the lack of agreement regarding their pathogenesis. One theory advanced claims that the process represents a foreign-body granulomatous reaction to implanted vegetable particles, more specifically those of pulses/legumes. In this study an animal model was developed where homogenized cooked legumes were implanted into the orofacial region of rats. Animals were killed at varying intervals ranging from one day to six months and the tissues associated with the implanted material were removed and processed for light microscopy. The experimentally produced lesions had many features similar to those found in humans, the similarities becoming more pronounced with time. The results indicate that the cellulose moiety of food particles of plant origin accidentally implanted into human tissues may cause the granulomatous reaction known as oral pulse granuloma."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Medicine and Surgery, University of Melbourne, Faculty of Dental Science, Victoria, Australia."}], "LastName": "Talacko", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Radden", "ForeName": "B G", "Initials": "BG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "J Oral Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "0342050", "ISSNLinking": "0300-9777"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9004-34-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Cellulose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cellulose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Foreign-Body Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Granuloma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hyalin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}], "NumberOfReferences": "29"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2456377", "10.1111/j.1600-0714.1988.tb01894.x"]}}]}
