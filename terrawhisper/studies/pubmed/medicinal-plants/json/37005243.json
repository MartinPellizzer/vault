The cannabinoids analyzed in this study were tetrahydrocannabinol acid (THCA), \u0394<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u0394<sup>9</sup>-THC), cannabidiol acid (CBDA), cannabidiol (CBD), \u0394<sup>8</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u0394<sup>8</sup>-THC), cannabinol (CBN), cannabichromene (CBC), cannabidivarin (CBDV), cannabigerolic acid (CBGA), cannabigerol (CBG) and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV). As a result, THCA was detected in the bracts at 28.4\u2009\u00b5g/mg, in the buds at 24.8\u2009\u00b5g/mg, and in the leaves at 5.1 to 10.5\u2009\u00b5g/mg in the drug-type cannabis plant. In addition, \u0394<sup>9</sup>-THC, CBGA, CBN, CBG, CBC, and THCV were mainly detected in bracts, buds, and leaves. On the other hand, as for the fiber-type cannabis plant, CBDA was detected in the bracts at 27.5\u2009\u00b5g/mg, in the buds at 10.6\u2009\u00b5g/mg, and in the leaves at 1.5-3.3\u2009\u00b5g/mg. In addition, \u0394<sup>9</sup>-THCA, CBD, \u0394<sup>9</sup>-THC, CBC, and CBG were mainly detected in bracts, buds, and leaves."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacognosy, Phytochemistry and Narcotics, National Institute of Health Sciences."}], "LastName": "Tanaka", "ForeName": "Rie", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacognosy, Phytochemistry and Narcotics, National Institute of Health Sciences."}], "LastName": "Mizutani", "ForeName": "Sakumi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacognosy, Phytochemistry and Narcotics, National Institute of Health Sciences."}], "LastName": "Kawamura", "ForeName": "Maiko", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Medicinal Plant Resources, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition."}], "LastName": "Fuchino", "ForeName": "Hiroyuki", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Medicinal Plant Resources, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Kochi Prefectural Makino Botanical Garden."}], "LastName": "Kawahara", "ForeName": "Nobuo", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacognosy, Phytochemistry and Narcotics, National Institute of Health Sciences."}], "LastName": "Kikura-Hanajiri", "ForeName": "Ruri", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "7J8897W37S", "NameOfSubstance": "Dronabinol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19GBJ60SN5", "NameOfSubstance": "Cannabidiol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K4497H250W", "NameOfSubstance": "cannabichromene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FJX8O3OJCD", "NameOfSubstance": "cannabidiolic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cannabinoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7UYP6MC9GH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cannabinol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cannabis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dronabinol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cannabidiol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cannabinoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cannabinol"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "32"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37005243", "10.1248/yakushi.22-00198"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
