Gaertn., a healthy, green vegetable with low sugar and high protein contents and high medicinal value, is severely affected by autotoxicity, which is a leading factor in the formation of plant disease. To help characterize the autotoxicity mechanism of P. cornutum (L.) Gaertn., we performed transcriptomic and metabolic analysis of the roots of P. cornutum (L.) Gaertn. response to phthalic acid, an autotoxin from P. cornutum (L.) Gaertn.", "In this study, high-throughput sequencing of nine RNA-seq libraries generated from the roots.of P. cornutum (L.) Gaertn. under different phthalic acid treatments yielded 37,737 unigenes. In total, 1085 (703 upregulated and 382 downregulated) and 5998 (4385 upregulated and 1613 downregulated) DEGs were identified under 0.1 and 10\u2009mmol\u00b7L<sup>-\u20091</sup> phthalic acid treatment, respectively, compared with the control treatment. Glutathione metabolism was among the top five important enriched pathways. In total, 457 and 435 differentially accumulated metabolites\u00a0were detected under 0.1 and 10\u2009mmol\u00b7L<sup>-\u20091</sup> phthalic acid treatment compared with the control, respectively, of which 223 and 253, respectively, increased in abundance. With the increase in phthalic acid concentration, the accumulation of ten metabolites increased significantly, while that of four metabolites decreased significantly, and phthalic acid, dambonitol, 4-hydroxy-butyric acid, homocitrulline, and ethyl \u03b2-D-glucopyranoside were 100 times more abundant under the 10\u2009mmol\u00b7L<sup>-\u20091</sup> phthalic acid treatment than under the control. Seventeen differentially expressed genes significantly associated with phthalic acid content were identified. In addition, the L-histidinol content was highest under 0.1\u2009mmol\u00b7L<sup>-\u20091</sup> phthalic acid, and a total of eleven differentially expressed genes were significantly positively correlated with the L-histidinol content, all of which were annotated to heat shock proteins, aquaporins and cysteine proteases.", "Accumulation of autotoxins altered the metabolic balance in P. cornutum (L.) Gaertn. and influenced water absorption and carbon and nitrogen metabolism. These important results provide insights into the formation mechanisms of autotoxicity and for the subsequent development of new control measures to improve the production and quality of replanted plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022.
