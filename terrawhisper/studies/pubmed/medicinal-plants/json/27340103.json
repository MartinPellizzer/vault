The absolute configuration of fladin A (1) was further confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The compounds were evaluated for their antifungal activity against the athlete's foot fungus Trichophyton rubrum. They were further evaluated for their antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity against the dental pathogens Streptococcus mutans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Candida albicans.", "Phytochemical and biological studies of I. flavidus led to the discovery of two antifungal compounds, fladin A (1) and lophanic acid (2). Fladin A (1) is a novel diterpene with an unprecedented cyclic ether group formed between C-4 and C-9. Lophanic acid (2) displayed inhibition activity against the athlete's foot fungus Trichophyton rubrum with an MIC value of 7.8\u03bcg/mL, and fladin A (1) also showed inhibition activity against the fungus with a MIC value of 62.5\u03bcg/mL.", "Our identification of two antifungal compounds provided strong evidence for the Miao people to use I. flavidus as a medicinal plant for treatment of athlete's foot disease.
