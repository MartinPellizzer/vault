Phenylethanoid glycosides (PhG), derived from Herba cistanche, are known to exert protective effects on cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the underlying mechanisms of this herbal extract on cognitive performance remain unclear. The aim of this study was thus to examine the protective mechanism attributed to PhG on cognitive deficits in an AD senescence accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) model. Cognitive deficit parameters examined included (1) Morris water maze (MWM) assessing cognitive performance and (2) quantification of dendritic spine density in hippocampal CA1 region by Golgi staining, a molecular biomarker of synaptic function. In addition, levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and gluthathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were determined to examine the potential role of oxidant processes in cognitive dysfunction. Data showed that PhG significantly decreased escape latency and path length, associated with a rise in the percentage of time spent in the target quadrant and number of platform crossings. In addition, PhG significantly increased dendritic spine density in the hippocampal CA1 region accompanied by elevated expression levels of synaptophysin (SYN) and post synaptic density 95 (PSD-95), reduced MDA content, and elevated the activities of SOD and GSH-Px. Data suggest that the ability of PhG to ameliorate cognitive deficits in SAMP8 mice may be related to promotion in synaptic plasticity involving antioxidant processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Human Anatomy , Baotou Medical College , Inner Mongolia , China."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Jian-Xin", "Initials": "JX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Human Anatomy , Baotou Medical College , Inner Mongolia , China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Xu-Sheng", "Initials": "XS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Human Anatomy , Baotou Medical College , Inner Mongolia , China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Zhi-Ping", "Initials": "ZP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Human Anatomy , Baotou Medical College , Inner Mongolia , China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Human Anatomy , Baotou Medical College , Inner Mongolia , China."}], "LastName": "Huo", "ForeName": "Dong-Sheng", "Initials": "DS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Human Anatomy , Baotou Medical College , Inner Mongolia , China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Bai-Feng", "Initials": "BF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b School of Health Sciences , University of Newcastle , Newcastle , Australia."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "He", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Human Anatomy , Baotou Medical College , Inner Mongolia , China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Zhan-Jun", "Initials": "ZJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cistanche"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cognition"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cognitive Dysfunction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28880744", "10.1080/15287394.2017.1367097"]}}]}
