Plant-derived chemotherapeutic agents such as taxol, etoposide or vincristine, currently used in cancer therapy, are prominent examples in this regard. However, there is a need for new and nat- ural anticancer compounds with low or without toxicity to normal cells. One of the active compounds responsible for the immune effects is \u03b2-glucan derived from cereals, fungi, seaweeds, yeasts and bacteria. The recent data suggest that \u03b2-glucans are potent immunomodulators with anticancer properties. Antitumor properties of fungi and yeast derived \u03b2-glucans have been widely recognized, but those polysaccharides are mostly insoluble, creating several problems especially in topical formulation. To overcome the issue of low water solubility, in the current study a more soluble \u03b2-glucan type from oats was chosen for the investigation of its antitumor activities. Cytotoxic effects were studied using a human melanoma cell line (Me45). The effect of electroporation on the antitumor activity of oat \u03b2-glucan was investigated as well. Cellular viability assessment, immuno-cytochemistry and immunofluochemistry were employed to evaluate biologic effects. Our results indicate strong anticancer properties of oat \u03b2-glucan, enhanced by electroporation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Choromanska", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kulbacka", "ForeName": "Julita", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Harasym", "ForeName": "Joanna", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dubinska-Magiera", "ForeName": "Magda", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saczko", "ForeName": "Jolanta", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pol Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "2985167R", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6837"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-Glucans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-43-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochromes c"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "CASP12 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "CASP3 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 12"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Avena"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 12"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochromes c"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Melanoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "beta-Glucans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29624267"]}}]}
