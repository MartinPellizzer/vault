Fundamentally, this review offers an excellent solution using MOFs-based sensors (e.g., fluorescent, electrochemical, electrochemiluminescence, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and colorimetric sensors) to detect food contaminants such as pesticide residues, mycotoxins, antibiotics, food additives, and other hazardous candidates. More importantly, their application scenarios and advantages in food detection are also introduced in more detail. Therefore, this systematic review analyzes detection limits, linear ranges, the role of functionalities, and immobilized nanoparticles utilized in preparing MOFs-based sensors. Additionally, the main limitations of each sensing type, along with the enhancement mechanisms of MOFs in addressing efficient sensing are discussed. Finally, the limitations and potential trends of MOFs-based materials in food contaminant detection are also highlighted."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
