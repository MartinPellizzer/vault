The loss of CYP3A4 activity was independent of NADPH. CYP3A4 competitive inhibitor ketoconazole and nucleophile <i>N</i>-acetylcysteine (NAC) slowed the inactivation. No recovery of CYP3A4 activity was observed after dialysis. Dihydrochelerythrine hardly inhibited CYP3A4, suggesting that the iminium group was primarily responsible for the inactivation. UV spectral analysis revealed that the maximal absorbance of CHE produced a significant red-shift after being mixed with NAC, suggesting that 1,2-addition possibly took place between the sulfhydryl group of NAC and iminium group of CHE. Molecular dynamics simulation and site-direct mutagenesis studies demonstrated that modification of Cys239 by the iminium group of CHE attributed to the inactivation. In conclusion, CHE is an affinity-labeling inactivator of CYP3A4. The observed enzyme inactivation resulted from the modification of Cys239 of CYP3A4 by the iminium group of CHE."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, College of Pharmacy, Mudanjiang Medical University, Mudanjiang 157011, PR China."}], "LastName": "Mao", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Guode", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shuangyashan Disease Control and Prevention Center, Shuangyashan 155100, PR China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Junqi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7921-3727"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Weiwei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, PR China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8187-2147"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, PR China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Jiang", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9716531", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2623"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "E3B045W6X0", "NameOfSubstance": "chelerythrine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzophenanthridines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzophenanthridines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38330258", "10.1021/acs.jmedchem.3c01943"]}}]}
