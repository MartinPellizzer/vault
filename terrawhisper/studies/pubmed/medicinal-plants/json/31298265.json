Chromatographic separation was optimized on a C18 column using a gradient elution of water/acetonitrile with the flow rate of 1.0\u00a0mL/min at 25\u00b0C at 280\u00a0nm. Sample preparation approach is rapid and energy efficient, and it requires no pre-concentration before analysis. Validation showed a good analytical performance in terms of specificity, linearity (r2\u00a0>\u00a00.999), precision (% RSD\u00a0<\u00a01.08), recovery (97-100.4%) and sensitivities (limits of detection: 12.48 and 14.95\u00a0ng/mL; limit of quantification: 41.61 and 49.85\u00a0ng/mL) of PZ and PT, respectively. Developed approach was employed for targeted phytochemical analysis in the bark and fruits of M. sikkimensis. The PZ content in the bark and leaves was highest (12-13\u00a0mg/100\u00a0mg), about 90-fold higher than fruits. PT was only present in the leaves (0.57\u00a0mg/100\u00a0mg). The comparative data on PZ and PT content in various wild apple species/cultivar from different countries have also been discussed. The reliability of the validated method was established by analyzing global and expanded uncertainties in two DHC determinations in wild apple. The present method fulfills the technical requirement of ISO 17025:2017 for quality control of M. sikkimensis."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.
