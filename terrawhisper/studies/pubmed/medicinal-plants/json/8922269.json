Crude extract of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) or purified lectin from red kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) in combination with selenomethionine were more effective in inhibiting the colony formation of Hela cells than when these cells were treated with these agents alone. Extracts of saffron (Crocus sativus) and selenite have previously been shown to inhibit the colony formation and nucleic acid synthesis by Hela cells in vitro. In the present study we examined the effects of saffron extract in combination with selenite on the colony formation and DNA and RNA synthesis in Hela cells. We found that the treatment of tumor Hela cells with saffron extract in combination with selenite increased the level of inhibition of the colony formation and nucleic acid synthesis in comparison with cells that were treated with only one of these agents. The inhibitory effect of saffron extract in combination with selenite was modified by intracellular sulfhydryl compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Research and Postgraduate Studies, Autonomous University of Queretaro, Mexico."}], "LastName": "Abdullaev", "ForeName": "F I", "Initials": "FI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gonzalez de Mejia", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biofactors", "NlmUniqueID": "8807441", "ISSNLinking": "0951-6433"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Selenium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "63231-63-0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "964MRK2PEL", "NameOfSubstance": "Selenomethionine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "HIW548RQ3W", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Selenite"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "RNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Selenium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Selenomethionine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Selenite"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spices"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8922269"]}}]}
