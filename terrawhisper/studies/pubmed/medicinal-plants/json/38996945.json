The ethnomedicinal knowledge are different among ethnic groups since the local flora and people's health beliefs generally vary among biocultural backgrounds. China with its diverse biocultural environment is rich in culturally important plant species including MPs. They are also essential in the context of conservation of plant resources and the related traditional medical knowledge, requiring an integrated perspective on these MPs.", "Focusing on the MPs used by the minority ethnic groups, this study assesses the diversity of MPs in China used in local indigenous traditions, as well as their conservation needs.", "The MPs used by the 18 selected minority ethnic groups were extracted from an ethnic MP dictionary. After standardizing, the names then were compiled as an inventory. Next, following statistics were computed: the number of species in each order and family, species used by each ethnic group, species documented in the national herbal resource dataset, species adopted in drug standards, and species at different levels of conservation lists. The overall similarity of the MPs used by the ethnic groups included was achieved using a cluster and principal component analysis.", "In total 5886 vascular plant species are reported as medicines in the 18 ethnic groups, which belong to 1657 genera and 243 families. It is found that 3195 species are used exclusively by one ethnic group, indicating their cultural salience and potential restrictedness in ecological terms. Moreover, 1159 species are included in national/regional drug standards, indicating their importance in the national medical flora. However, only 3541 species of them are documented in the national herbal resource dataset, and 761 species are at different levels of threatened status, highlighting the conservation needs of Chinese MPs and the related traditional medical knowledge.", "Using a quantitative approach, for the first time the present study reveals the high level of taxonomic diversity of MPs used by minority ethnic groups of China. However, of these species, 40% are still not inventoried in the national herbal resource dataset, and more than half are used exclusively by one ethnic group, and around 13% are included in the conservation lists of different levels. These together urge the conservation of MP resources and related traditional medical knowledge. Additionally, we recommend fostering the cross-cultural communication the regional ethnomedicinal knowledge, for the purpose of maximizing the benefits of regional plants to human."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
