Liver is a vital body organ which not only performs metabolic activities but also aids in detoxification, storage and digestion of food. Now a day's malnutrition, alcohol consumption and drug addiction are major causes of liver diseases throughout the world. In fact, there is no possible outcome to compensate liver malfunction for long term, and transplantation of liver is the only option left after the irretrievable injury of hepatic function. Subsequently, natural based therapeutic approaches are in the process of scrupulous testing as strong hepatoprotective mediator. In this regard plants are well thought hepatoprotective agents having multiple active components. In this review, based on species' pharmacology and safety we have compiled some plants which show strong hepatoprotective activity, main phytoconstituents with biological activities and few commercially used herbal formulations.", "Ethnopharmacological information was gathered by an extensive literature survey like WHO monographs on selected herbal medicinal plants (Vol 1-Vol 4); Principles and Practice of Phytotherapy, Mills S and Bone K, Churchill Livingstone, London, UK; Herbal Drugs and Phytopharmaceuticals, Wichtl M Medpharm Press, Stuttgart 3rd edn; Pharmacology and Applications of Chinese Materia Medica Vols 1 and 2, Chang H-M and But P P-H World Scientific, Singapore; British Herbal Compendium Vol. 2, Bradley P British Herbal Medicine Association, Bournemouth, UK; ESCOP Monographs 2nd edn. Thieme, Stuttgart, Germany; as well as by using electronic databases such as Pubchem, Chemspider, http://www.herbal-ahp.org; http://www.ahpa.org; http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2003/9241546271.pdf; http://www.escop.com, Pubmed, HubMed and Scopus.", "Data for more about 29 plants have been accomplished for their bioactive constituent(s), biological activities and medicinal uses. Some of the plants have been identified as strong hepato-modulator. Such knowledge about traditional medicinal plants can be globally applied for safe and evidence based use in pharmacological applications.", "With the rise in liver risks a meek struggle has been made to draw attention toward herbal therapy. Hepatoprotective constituents of said plants are expressed with chemical structures. However, for certain plants active constituents are not still isolated/purified but overall plant extract was found effective in providing protection against hepatic injury. As a future perspective, there is need to purify plant active constituents for ethnomedical rationale."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
