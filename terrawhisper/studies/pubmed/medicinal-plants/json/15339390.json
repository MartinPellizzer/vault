Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) was also determined by immunohistochemistry. PNS 10, 30, and 50 mg/kg were administered iv per day from 2 d before to 4 weeks after operation.", "The endothelium was denudated completely after BED. At the 4th week the endothelium was repaired in some degree, then recovered gradually at 6 and 8 week. The degree of intimal thickening at 4 week was significantly greater than that at 0, 6, or 8 week. The sequence of VEGF or MMP-2 staining from strong to weak was 4, 6, 0, 8 week, and normal control. However at 4 week, endothelial regeneration in PNS 30 and 50 mg/kg groups was significantly faster than that in saline group. The intimal thickness was significantly decreased and expressions of VEGF and MMP-2 were both down-regulated in PNS 30 or 50 mg/kg groups compared with saline control group.", "PNS promoted the endothelial regeneration and reduced ECM thickening, which was related to regulation of the expression of VEGF and MMP-2. PNS may have sustained antirestenotic effect after BED."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, the 4th Affliated Hospital of Ji-nan University, Pharmacy College, Ji-nan University, Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Si-Wei", "Initials": "SW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hong", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Kai-He", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Zuo-Feng", "Initials": "ZF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Xian-Da", "Initials": "XD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Catheterization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Down-Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelium, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["injuries", "metabolism", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Iliac Artery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15339390"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
