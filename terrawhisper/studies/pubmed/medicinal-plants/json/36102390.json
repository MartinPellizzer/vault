The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of hederagenin on decreasing blood lipid and anti-oxidative stress in oleic acid-induced HepG2 cells and hyperlipidemic rats, and explore underlying mechanisms. In vitro, TG was used as the index to verify the lipid-lowering effect of hederagenin in oleic acid-induced HepG2 cells. In vivo, TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C were used as direct indicators to study the antilipemic effect of hederagenin in hyperlipidemic rats. MDA, SOD, and GSH-PX were measured to analyze the anti-oxidative effect of hederagenin. The signaling pathways of anti-oxidation were evaluated using Western blot. Our results showed that hederagenin (250\u03bcmol/L) increased significantly TG clearance rate. In addition, treatment with hederagenin, XZK and simvastatin reduced effectively TC, TG, LDL-C and MDA content, and increased HDL-C, SOD and GSH-PX in HFD rats. Moreover, the phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK was inhibited after administration of hederagenin, XZK and simvastatin. Our results revealed that hederagenin possessed beneficial potentials for hypolipidemic effects, especially in TG clearance. The mechanism might be associated with inhibition of lipid absorption, reduction of lipid oxidation, and down-regulation of p38MAPK phosphorylation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0857-2815"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Engineering, Jiang Su Food & pharmaceutical science college, China, 4, Meicheng Road, Huaian 223003, PR China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0426-0585"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Engineering, Jiang Su Food & pharmaceutical science college, China, 4, Meicheng Road, Huaian 223003, PR China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4290-2187"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Engineering, Jiang Su Food & pharmaceutical science college, China, 4, Meicheng Road, Huaian 223003, PR China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qiaoling", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "An Acad Bras Cienc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503280", "ISSNLinking": "0001-3765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2UMI9U37CP", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SMK8R7TGJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AGG2FN16EV", "NameOfSubstance": "Simvastatin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RQF57J8212", "NameOfSubstance": "hederagenin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hep G2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Simvastatin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "53"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36102390", "10.1590/0001-3765202220201909", "S0001-37652022000600603"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
