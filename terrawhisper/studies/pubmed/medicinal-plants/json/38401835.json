These larvae belong to the diverse family Scarabaeidae and are typically harvested from the wild during their immature stage based on morphological characteristics. However, rapid and accurate identification becomes challenging when relying solely on external morphological features, as the lack of clarity on biological sources raises safety concerns for clinical applications. The application of DNA metabarcoding provides a solution by enabling the determination of the biological source of a large sample. In the current study, we collected 19 batches of Grubs, consisting of 11,539 individuals, from the market and analyzed their biological composition through metabarcoding. We identified 49 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs), 21 of which were Grubs. The 21 ASVs were classified into seven Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) through species delimitation, which revealed that commercially available Grubs are predominantly sourced from Protaetia brevitarsis seulensis, while species of Rutelinae, Anomala, and Holotrichia were also abundant in some commercial batches. Among the identified ASVs, 28 belonged to non-Grub species and indicated adulteration from different animal families; high abundances of these ASVs were detected for Bombycidae, Tabanidae, and Viviparidae. Our findings underscore the complexity of Grubs' species composition and advocate for a deeper understanding of the wildlife sources contributing to herbal products. This research contributes valuable insights into the molecular identification of Grubs, paving the way for enhanced quality assurance in traditional medicine applications to provide safe and effective medicines for humanity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
