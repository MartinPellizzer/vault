When cultured on MS medium without hormone, light promoted the elongation and lateral root formation of type II hairy root, but not of type I hairy root. Among three tested hormones, IAA at low concentration was the best for growth of type I hairy root, while 1 mg x L(-1) IBA was the most suitable for growth of type II hairy root. With the increase of hormone level added into MS medium, callusing frequencies of type I, II hairy roots were increased, at the same time, the formation of lateral root from hairy root or callus was inhibited."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Shantou University, Shantou 515063, China. hzh@stu.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Zhong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yi-Xin", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yi-Rui", "Initials": "YR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lighting"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Lycium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16570792"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
