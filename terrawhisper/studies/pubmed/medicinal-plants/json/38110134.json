There are numerous applications for them, such as treating leukemia, AIDS, and liver cancer. It should be noted that around 20% of these plants have shown harmful side effects when used in clinical applications, including solid irritations to the skin and mucous membranes, carcinogenic effects, organ damage, vomiting, and diarrhea.", "This paper aims to review the toxic side effects, toxic compounds, toxic mechanisms, and detoxification methods of Traditional Herbals in Thymelaeaceae, guiding their safe clinical uses.", "This review employed the keywords \"Thymelaeaceae,\" 48 different \"genus,\" 966 \"species,\" and the combination of \"toxicity\" to identify the medicinal value and toxicity of plants from Thymelaeaceae in scientific databases (Pubmed, SciFinder Scholar, Elsevier, Web of Science, and CNKI). Information relevant to the toxicity of Traditional Herbals from Thymelaeaceae up to June 2023 has been summarized. The plant names have been checked with \"World Flora Online\" (www.worldfloraonline.org).", "28 toxic Traditional Herbals from 13 genera within the Thymelaeaceae family were categorized. Toxicities were summarized at the cellular, animal, and clinical levels. The toxic substances are primarily concentrated in the Daphne L. and Wikstroemia Endl. genera, with terpenes being the main toxic components. The toxicity mechanism is primarily associated with the mitochondrial pathways. Detoxification and enhanced efficacy can be achieved through processing methods such as vinegar-processing and sweat-soaking.", "Medicinal plants in the Thymelaeaceae exhibit significant pharmacological activities, such as anti-HIV and anti-tumor effects, indicating a broad potential for application. However, their clinical uses are hindered by their inherent toxicity. Researching the toxic components and mechanisms of these Traditional Herbals and exploring more effective detoxification methods can contribute to unveiling the latent value of these medicinal plants from Thymelaeaceae."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
