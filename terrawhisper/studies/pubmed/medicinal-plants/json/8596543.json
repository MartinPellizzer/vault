In other countries, people prefer ripe and dried areca nut without husk. In this study, we compared the reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative DNA damage in isolated DNA and CHO-K1 cells between treatments with tender areca nut extract (ANE) and ripe ANE. Incubation of these two ANE preparations with isolated DNA generated 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) in an alkaline environment in a dose-dependent manner. Ripe ANE generated higher levels of 8-OH-dG compared to tender ANE. The addition of iron(II) (100 microM) resulted in 1.4- and 3.1-fold increases of 8-OH-dG when incubated with 1 mg/ml each of tender and ripe ANE. In testing the effect of ANE to cellular DNA, CHO-K1 cells were used for its documented sensitivity to reactive oxygen species. In CHO-K1 cells, ripe ANE was more cytotoxic than tender ANE following an 18-h incubation. The cytotoxicity to CHO-K1 cells was positively correlated with the formation of 8-OH-dG following tender (r=0.97) and ripe (r=0.91) ANE treatment. Addition of the iron chelating agent o-phenanthroline (10 and 20 microM) to cells prior to ri ANE exposure significantly increased (p<0.05) the survival of CHO-K1 cells. In addition, ripe ANE induced dichlorofluorescein-mediated fluorescence which indicated the formation of hydrogen peroxide in CHO-K1 cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that ANE-induced oxidative damage to isolated and cellular DNA which may result from the generation of hydrogen peroxide, and iron may serve as a catalyst in this process. Furthermore, ripe ANE generated higher oxidative DNA damage levels compared to tender ANE."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Research, Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "T Y", "Initials": "TY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chi", "ForeName": "C W", "Initials": "CW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenanthrolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "88847-89-6", "NameOfSubstance": "8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G9481N71RO", "NameOfSubstance": "Deoxyguanosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "W4X6ZO7939", "NameOfSubstance": "1,10-phenanthroline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "CHO Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetinae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Deoxyguanosine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fishes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nuts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenanthrolines"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spermatozoa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8596543", "10.1016/s0165-1218(96)90018-x", "S0165-1218(96)90018-X"]}}]}
