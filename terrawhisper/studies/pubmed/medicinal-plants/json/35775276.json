Pennel) is a medicinal aquatic herb used to treat diseases in South Asia. Various regeneration protocols have been developed or modified in vitro to ensure the availability of biomass and secondary metabolites of <i>Bacopa</i>. We applied hydrothermally treated titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) nanoparticles (NPs) (TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs) at different concentrations. Three explants, distal portion of half leaf (DPHL), proximal portion of half leaf (PPHL) and full leaf (FL), were used to evaluate response to TiO<sub>2</sub>. Regeneration from the three explants in vitro was similar except for shoot length. Application of TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs exerted significant, but variable, effects on all parameters except percentage of shoot formation, which was 100%. Interactive effects of explant and TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs exhibited significant, but variable, effects on fresh weight and percentage of callus formation. All explants produced more shoots using TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs compared to control treatments. DPHL explants with application of 8\u2009mg/l TiO<sub>2</sub> produced more shoots than controls. Similarly, FL explant treated with 2\u2009mg/l TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs produced more shoots/explant than controls. All concentrations of TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs produced significantly longer shoots compared to controls. Increased elongation of shoots justifies use of TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs for propagation of plants in vitro during acclimatization. Use of TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs for rapid elongation of shoots ultimately fosters survival of plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8524-9029"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sivas University of Science and Technology, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Aasim", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sivas University of Science and Technology, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Korkmaz", "ForeName": "Ecenur", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Karamanoglu Mehmetbey University, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Culu", "ForeName": "Ayse", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sivas University of Science and Technology, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kahveci", "ForeName": "Burak", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Karamanoglu Mehmetbey University, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Sonmezoglu", "ForeName": "Ozlem Ates", "Initials": "OA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biotech Histochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9107378", "ISSNLinking": "1052-0295"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacopa"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regeneration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35775276", "10.1080/10520295.2022.2087236"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
