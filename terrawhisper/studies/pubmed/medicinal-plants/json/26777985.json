In this work, we compared the content of saponin in cultivation and adventitious root. The total content of saponins in adventitious root (8.48\u00a0mg\u22c5g<sup>-1</sup> ) was found lower than in the native one (3-year-old) (34.34\u00a0mg\u22c5g<sup>-1</sup> ). To enhance the content of bioactive compounds, we applied elicitors jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl dihydrojasmonate (MDJ) to the adventitious root culture. It was observed that the highest total content of saponins (71.94\u00a0mg\u22c5g<sup>-1</sup> ) was achieved after treatment with 5\u00a0mg\u22c5L<sup>-1</sup> JA, which was 2.09-fold higher than native roots and 8.45-fold higher than the control group. The findings from high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analysis showed that six new compounds were present after the treatment with the elicitors. Furthermore, we found that JA and MDJ significantly upregulated the expression of the geranyl diphosphate synthase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, squalene synthase, squalene epoxidase, dammarenediol synthase, and CYP716A47 and CYP716A53v2 (CYP450 enzyme) genes; downregulated the expression of the cycloartenol synthase gene; and increased superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jinxin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin ZhongXin Pharmaceuticals R&D Center, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Xiaolei", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Dahui", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Industrial Fermentation Microbiology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jianli", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Industrial Fermentation Microbiology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Shujie", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wenyuan", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Appl Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "8609465", "ISSNLinking": "0885-4513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxylipins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ethyl dihydrophaseate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "14351-29-2", "NameOfSubstance": "dammarenediol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6RI5N05OWW", "NameOfSubstance": "jasmonic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxylipins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Panax notoginseng"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26777985", "10.1002/bab.1477"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
