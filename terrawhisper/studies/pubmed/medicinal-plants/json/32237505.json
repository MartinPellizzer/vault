A diversity of plants rich in indigo compounds belong to traditional Chinese herbal medicines. Indigo compounds have a variety of biological and pharmacological activities, including anticonvulsant, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral and anticancer activities. A substantial progress in indigo biosynthesis has been made lately. This paper summarizes the value of indigo from the aspects of cultural history, biosynthetic pathways and the medicinal activities of its related derivatives involved in the pathways. In addition, the latest research advancements in indigo biosynthetic pathways is demonstrated in this paper, which would lay the theoretical foundation for the exploration and utilization of natural indigo."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Landscape Architecture, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou 350002, China Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of China Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration for Orchid Conservation and Utilization, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yi-Ming", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Landscape Architecture, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou 350002, China Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration for Orchid Conservation and Utilization, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yuan-Zhen", "Initials": "YZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of China Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Hui-Hua", "Initials": "HH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration for Orchid Conservation and Utilization, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou 350002, China College of Forestry, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ze-Xin", "Initials": "ZX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of China Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Landscape Architecture, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou 350002, China Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration for Orchid Conservation and Utilization, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Sha-Sha", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Landscape Architecture, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou 350002, China Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration for Orchid Conservation and Utilization, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Zhai", "ForeName": "Jun-Wen", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of China Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Mi", "ForeName": "Yao-Lei", "Initials": "YL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D3741U8K7L", "NameOfSubstance": "Indigo Carmine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biosynthetic Pathways"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Indigo Carmine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Indigofera"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32237505", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20191204.102"]}}]}
