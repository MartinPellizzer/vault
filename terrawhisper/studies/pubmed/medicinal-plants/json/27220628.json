Therefore, we assessed 22 medicinal plants growing naturally on tannery pollutant contaminated (Site-C) and non-contaminated (Site-NC) sites for their ability to accumulate chromium (Cr). The Cr contents in soil and various plant parts were estimated using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Translocation and bioconcentration factors were calculated. The soil at Site-C had 27-fold higher concentration of total Cr than at Site-NC. Chromium accumulation is reported for the first time in 50\u00a0% of the medicinal plants examined and varied significantly among the sites. Shoots of Ricinus communis and Amaranthus viridis had maximum concentrations of Cr at Site-C, whereas in Site-NC, none of the plants had Cr accumulation >30\u00a0ppm. Ricinus communis, Amaranthus viridis, and Amaranthus spinosus had translocation factor (TF) greater than the one in the Site-C and Lantana camara had TF >1 in Site-NC. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) was >1 only for Ricinus communis at both the sites. The majority of the medicinal plants at Site-NC had Cr content exceeding the permissible limit of 2\u00a0ppm suggested for herbal raw material. The results of the study clearly emphasize the need for screening plants of therapeutic value for the presence of HMs even when collected from non-contaminated soils. Moreover, proportional allocation of Cr in different plant parts provided an insight on the safety of these parts when specifically used in herbal preparations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Root and Soil Biology Laboratory, Department of Botany, Bharathiar University, Coimbatore, 641046, Tamilnadu, India."}], "LastName": "Jaison", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Root and Soil Biology Laboratory, Department of Botany, Bharathiar University, Coimbatore, 641046, Tamilnadu, India. tmkum@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Muthukumar", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biol Trace Elem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7911509", "ISSNLinking": "0163-4984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0R0008Q3JB", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amaranthus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chromium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ricinus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27220628", "10.1007/s12011-016-0740-1", "10.1007/s12011-016-0740-1"]}}]}
