All plants have to maintain the reactive oxygen species within certain levels for normal cellular homeostasis by means of their antioxidant systems, which can be classified as enzymatic and non-enzymatic. Plants under drought stress generate an excess production of reactive oxygen species. At high concentrations, this can be detrimental by producing damage to the protein structures and inhibiting enzymes, as well as oxidizing macromolecules, which may eventually lead to cell death. There has been increasing attention paid to the antioxidant capacity of aromatic/medicinal plants, with a high antioxidant content having been reported in some plant extracts, such as in Mentha piperita (peppermint). Peppermint plants cultivated under drought stress also present high levels of phenolic compounds, peroxidase enzyme activity and lipid peroxidation of membranes. A simple and inexpensive laboratory class is proposed for teaching some mechanisms that plants have evolved to avoid reactive oxygen species damage. The series of lab experiments described is aimed at demonstrating the antioxidant status in aromatic plants subjected to drought stress, by measuring total phenolic compound content (non-enzymatic antioxidant compound), peroxidase activity (enzymatic antioxidant) and malondialdehyde, as convenient biomarkers for lipid peroxidation. The proposed class will be carried out by undergraduate students of the advanced biochemistry course, as part of our biology and agronomy studies. The experiment presented is intended to be used as a vehicle to emphasize the concepts that students have learned in their lectures. This lab exercise to be carried out by the students has dual goals: to apply a methodology only learned superficially on previous courses, and also to increase their understanding of how plants developed resistance mechanisms in order to tolerate drought stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Biolog\u00eda Molecular, Universidad Nacional de R\u00edo Cuarto, Argentina."}], "LastName": "Chiappero", "ForeName": "Julieta", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Biolog\u00eda Molecular, Universidad Nacional de R\u00edo Cuarto, Argentina."}], "LastName": "Cappellari", "ForeName": "Lorena Del Rosario", "Initials": "LDR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Biolog\u00eda Molecular, Universidad Nacional de R\u00edo Cuarto, Argentina."}], "LastName": "Palermo", "ForeName": "Tamara Belen", "Initials": "TB"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2436-922X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Biolog\u00eda Molecular, Universidad Nacional de R\u00edo Cuarto, Argentina."}], "LastName": "Giordano", "ForeName": "Walter", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8588-587X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Biolog\u00eda Molecular, Universidad Nacional de R\u00edo Cuarto, Argentina."}], "LastName": "Banchio", "ForeName": "Erika", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Mol Biol Educ", "NlmUniqueID": "100970605", "ISSNLinking": "1470-8175"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["education"], "DescriptorName": "Biomedical Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Droughts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mentha piperita"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Tas S, Tas B.
