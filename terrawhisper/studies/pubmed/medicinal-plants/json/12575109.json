The results showed cell growth and rosmarinic acid content reached the maximum on the 12th day and lithospermic acid B content on the 16th day after incubating cells in the subculture medium MS + 2, 4-D 1 mg/L + KT 0.1 mg/L. This cell line was a growth-product-associated. With the same concentration (1 mg/L), 2, 4-D stimulated the cell growth but prohibited the formation of lithospermic acid B; GA3 inhabited the cell growth but stimulated the formation of two depsides; The effects of BA is between 2, 4-D and GA3. The concentration optimum of phytohormones tested displayed 3 mg/L for BA and 1 mg/L for GA3. For the optimum time of adding BA and GA3 was in med-term (the 8th day) and early term (at the beginning) of culture period respectively. The synergiatic function of BA and GA3 on the depside formation was also showed that adding GA3 (1 mg/L) was favour for the formation of lithospermic acid B of the suspension cell cultured in the medium containing BA 3 mg/L. The suitable time of adding GA3 was the 6the day after incubating cells in the medium of MS + BA 3 mg/L."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200032."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzofurans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cinnamates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Depsides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "C1GQ844199", "NameOfSubstance": "salvianolic acid B"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Benzofurans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Depsides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rosmarinic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12575109"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
