In order to clarify the pharmacological mechanism and involved metabolic pathways of P. japonicas,the gene expression of Tetrahymena thermophila under P. japonicus treatment was analyzed through high-throughput transcriptome sequencing in this study. Based on the transcriptome analysis,3 544 differentially expressed genes were identified in control group,of which 1 945 genes showed up-regulated expression and 1 599 genes showed down-regulated expression. Under P. japonicas treatment in the experiment group,3 312 differentially expressed genes were screened,of which 1 `493 genes showed up-regulated expression and 1 819 genes showed down-regulated expression. GO enrichment analysis indicated that in control group,the genes in the cells in a series of fundamental biological process were down-regulated,such as DNA replication and protein synthesis; while the signal transduction process and fatty acids oxidizing process were enriched. Whereas in the experiment group,down-regulated genes were mainly enriched in oxidation-reduction,cofactor metabolic process and vitamin metabolic process; up-regulated genes were enriched in signal transduction process and protein modification process. In the analysis using KEGG database,cell cycle pathway was enhanced and autophagy pathway was inhibited under the condition of P. japonicas treatment. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction( RT-qPCR) was used to detect the expression differences between 6 up-regulated and 4 down-regulated genes in related metabolic pathways. The RT-q PCR results and RNA-Seq data were highly correlated and consistent with each other. This study could provide important direction and basis for further study on the mechanism of cell growth regulation with the treatment of P. japonica."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation,Institute of Hydrobiology,Chinese Academy of Sciences Wuhan 430072,China University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing 100049,China."}], "LastName": "Chai", "ForeName": "Xiao-Cui", "Initials": "XC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation,Institute of Hydrobiology,Chinese Academy of Sciences Wuhan 430072,China University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing 100049,China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Wen-Tao", "Initials": "WT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Geriatrics,Hubei University of Chinese Medicine Wuhan 430065,China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation,Institute of Hydrobiology,Chinese Academy of Sciences Wuhan 430072,China University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing 100049,China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xue-Feng", "Initials": "XF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation,Institute of Hydrobiology,Chinese Academy of Sciences Wuhan 430072,China."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Geriatrics,Hubei University of Chinese Medicine Wuhan 430065,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation,Institute of Hydrobiology,Chinese Academy of Sciences Wuhan 430072,China."}], "LastName": "Miao", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Networks and Pathways"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Tetrahymena thermophila"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31359727", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190304.001"]}}]}
