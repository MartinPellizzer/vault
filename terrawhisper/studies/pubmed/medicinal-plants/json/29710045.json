Ninety percent of the diabetic population suffers from type-2 diabetes, which still needs an effective, safe and economical oral hypoglycemic therapy. Plants are rich sources of various therapeutic molecules. More than 400 medicinal plants of interesting phytochemical diversity have been reported for their antidiabetic potential. Naphthoquinones are a group of phytochemicals, which have a wide range of pharmacological potential, including antidiabetic activity. Naphthoquinones exert their antidiabetic effects through various mechanisms such as the inhibition of \u03b1-glucosidase and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, increased glucose uptake in myocytes and adipocytes via glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and GLUT2 translocations, enhanced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) ligand activity, and by normalizing carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes in the liver. Moreover, naphthoquinone inhibits adipogenesis by both upstream and downstream regulation to control obesity, which is one of the important risk factors for diabetes. Naturally occurring naphthoquinones, as well as their plant sources, are therefore of interest for exploring their antidiabetic potential. The present review aims to overview the antidiabetic potential of naphthoquinones and their plant resources in Thailand."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Prince of Songkla University."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Muhammad Ajmal", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research and Horticulture Department, Gardens by the Bay."}], "LastName": "Keach", "ForeName": "James E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Prince of Songkla University."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytomedicine and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology Excellence Center, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Prince of Songkla University."}], "LastName": "Panichayupakaranant", "ForeName": "Pharkphoom", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0377775", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2363"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthoquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.48", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.20", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Glucosidases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Adipogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Glucosidases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29710045", "10.1248/cpb.c17-00529"]}}]}
