Some herbs are used to reduce PP pain. Due to the anti-inflammatory properties of <i>Triticum sativum</i> (wheat) germ, this study was conducted to investigate the effect of wheat germ on PP pain.", "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial performed on 90 women who had a vaginal delivery and complained of moderate to severe PP pain. The participants were randomly divided into two groups. In the intervention group, a capsule containing 500 mg of wheat germ was taken every 6 hr for 2 days and in the control group, a placebo capsule was taken in the same order. The severity of PP pain was measured before and one hour after receiving the capsule by using the Visual Analogue Scale.", "The two groups were not different in terms of pain severity before the intervention. The PP pain in women with moderate pain was significantly reduced in both groups, the reduction was greater in the wheat germ group (GEE=0.04) but this reduction was not significant. The PP pain in women with severe pain was significantly reduced in both groups, however, the reduction was significantly greater in the wheat germ group (GEE=0.63, p=0.007). Moreover, the results showed that the use of mefenamic acid in the wheat germ group was significantly lower than the control group (p=0.04). Moreover, no side effect was reported after consuming the wheat germ.", "It seems that wheat germ reduces severe PP pain. Further research on this plant is recommended."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery & Reproductive Health, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mehravar", "ForeName": "Samira", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Midwifery and Reproductive Health Research Center, Department of Midwifery and Reproductive Health, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amir Ali Akbari", "ForeName": "Sedigheh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic sciences, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nasiri", "ForeName": "Malihe", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mojab", "ForeName": "Faraz", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Preventative Gynecology Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbasi", "ForeName": "Hajar", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Avicenna J Phytomed", "NlmUniqueID": "101586220", "ISSNLinking": "2228-7930"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that there is no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Abbasi M, Hashemipour S, Hajmanuchehri F, Kazemifar AM.
