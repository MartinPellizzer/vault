Clarke (Acanthaceae), a rare medicinal shrub, was achieved through callus-free axillary meristem proliferation from stem node explants of field-grown plants cultured in SH medium. Shoot multiplication was a function of cytokinin activity but sustained growth of the shoots was dependent on the synergistic effect with the auxin, IAA. An optimum number of 5-10 shoots per explant were obtained in 6 weeks using 3.0 mg.l(-1) BAP, 0.5 mg.l(-1) 2-ip and 1.0 mg.l(-1) IAA, Upon subculture, vertical halves of the precultured node with the differentiated shoots yielded a larger aggregate number of shoots (23-27) than the uncut precultured node left intact (15-17). Shoot multiplication was rapid and consistent over prolonged periods when the hormonal concentrations were reduced to 1.0 mg.l(-1) BAP and 0.2 mg.l(-1) IAA during subculture, and reculture of the nodal explants derived from shoot cultures. Rooting of 3-5 cm shoots thus obtained was greatly accelerated in stationary liquid medium containing 0.2 mg.l(-1) IBA or IAA. Hardening of the rooted plantlets in the humidity chamber was essential for high frequency (95%) survival. Micropropagated plants established in the field flowered after fifteen months and were free from apparent defects in cytological, growth and flowering characteristics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Biotechnology Unit, Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute, 695 562, Thiruvananthapuram, India."}], "LastName": "Sudha", "ForeName": "C G", "Initials": "CG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Seeni", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "9880970", "ISSNLinking": "0721-7714"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Cell Rep. 1992 May;11(4):200-3", "ArticleIdList": ["24202986"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Cell Rep. 1989 May;8(1):44-7", "ArticleIdList": ["24232594"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24193652", "10.1007/BF00239893"]}}]}
