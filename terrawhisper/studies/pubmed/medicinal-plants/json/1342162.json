Seeds germination was carried out in darkness at 25 degrees C and 85% RH during 72 hours, previously soaked overnight in a solution of sodium hypochlorite at a concentration of 50 ppm. Germination capacity was assessed by determining hypocotyl and epicotyl lengths and percent of sprouted seed. The seeds were milled and freeze-dried for the chemical analysis. Germination promoted a significant increase in crude protein content and reduction also significant in phytates levels. These changes were attributed to an increase of proteases and phytase activities. In fact, this enzyme would make a solubilization of phytates and would release soluble protein and minerals. A significant reduction of flatulence oligosaccharides took place, which was also explained by an increase of alpha-galactosidase concentration. Sprouted seeds showed a higher content of almost all amino acid than crude legumes, although this change was variable. Significant increase of riboflavin was also found. Finally, germination decreased ashes and fat contents. These findings were determined in all legumes, although both cultivars of beans showed a higher response to the biochemical changes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unidad de Agroindustrias, Universidad de Chile, Santiago."}], "LastName": "Camacho", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sierra", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Campos", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guzm\u00e1n", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Marcus", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Cambios nutricionales inducidos por la germinaci\u00f3n de leguminosas de consumo habitual en Chile."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7IGF0S7R8I", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TLM2976OFR", "NameOfSubstance": "Riboflavin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Riboflavin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1342162"]}}]}
