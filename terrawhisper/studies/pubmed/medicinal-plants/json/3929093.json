When seeds were surface disinfected, mold fungi were detected in 73% of the seeds whereas 81% of the seed that was not disinfected produced mold fungi. Aspergillus spp. was most frequently present while Penicillium spp. occurred in seed of 4 varieties and in less than 4% of the seed. Twelve isolates of A. flavus and A. parasiticus were examined for their ability to produce aflatoxins. Whether aflatoxins were produced and the amount of each varied according to the origin of the isolate and the species of Aspergillus. For example all A. parasiticus isolates produced at least 2 aflatoxins whereas 4 of the A. parasiticus isolates were non-toxigenic. When ground seeds of winged beans were inoculated with an aflatoxigenic strain of A. parasiticus the level of aflatoxins that occurred varied with the variety, however, the level of aflatoxin was higher in winged bean than in peanut tissue and 6 of the 12 winged bean varieties contained higher levels of aflatoxins than rice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bean", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fernando", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mycopathologia", "NlmUniqueID": "7505689", "ISSNLinking": "0301-486X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DY38VHM5OD", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus flavus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Penicillium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Appl Microbiol. 1975 Apr;29(4):522-6", "ArticleIdList": ["1168442"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 1962 Sep 15;195:1062-3", "ArticleIdList": ["14479064"]}, {"Citation": "J Assoc Off Anal Chem. 1976 May;59(3):662-5", "ArticleIdList": ["944693"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3929093", "10.1007/BF00436729"]}}]}
