Litsemene A (1) possessed a unique 8-member ring through unexpected cyclization of the methyl group on C-10 of guaiane. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques including IR, UV, NMR, HR-ESI-MS, and their absolute configurations were assigned by ECD calculations. All isolated sesquiterpenoids were analyzed by bioinformatics and evaluated for their neuroprotective effects against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced injury in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 China Pharmaceutical University.
