The three bacterial species exhibited differential survival on leaves, in soil, and in guts and fecal pellets (frass) of the insects. High numbers of Enterobacter cloacae(pBR322) were detected in all samples, while the other species were unable to establish residence in the insect. To assess the impact of this colonization on site-to-site transport of microorganisms, larvae were fed plants that had been sprayed with the bacteria and then were transferred to uninoculated plants. Cutworms were efficient carriers of Enterobacter cloacae(pBR322), as indicated by its rapid appearance on uninoculated leaves and continued persistence in the insects for 3 days after transfer. Few Erwinia herbicola(pBR322) and K. planticola(pBR322) were obtained from larvae after transfer, although up to 10(3) CFU/g were detected in soil and on plants. Differences in bacterial survival and growth were confirmed by incubating frass overnight and observing the change in population numbers. The proportion of total samples showing at least a 25-fold increase during incubation was 68% for Enterobacter cloacae(pBR322), 39% for K. planticola(pBR322), and 0% for Erwinia herbicola(pBR322). Our results emphasize the role that cutworms and possibly other insects have in persistence and growth of microorganisms in the environment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Terrestrial Microbial Ecology/Biotechnology Program, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Corvallis, Oregon 97333."}], "LastName": "Armstrong", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Porteous", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wood", "ForeName": "N D", "Initials": "ND"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Environ Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7605801", "ISSNLinking": "0099-2240"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Enterobacteriaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Insect Vectors"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Intestines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Larva"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lepidoptera"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plasmids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "J Med Entomol. 1978 Feb 10;14(5):597-8", "ArticleIdList": ["344884"]}, {"Citation": "J Bacteriol. 1941 Dec;42(6):757-90", "ArticleIdList": ["16560484"]}, {"Citation": "Recomb DNA Tech Bull. 1984 Mar;7(1):20-30", "ArticleIdList": ["6587444"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Microbiol. 1972 Oct;24(4):575-80", "ArticleIdList": ["4628796"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1982 Sep;44(3):708-14", "ArticleIdList": ["6814361"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1988 May;54(5):1174-81", "ArticleIdList": ["16347630"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2802606", "PMC203056", "10.1128/aem.55.9.2200-2205.1989"]}}]}
