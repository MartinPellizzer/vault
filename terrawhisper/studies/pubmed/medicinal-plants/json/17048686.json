Mice were divided into normal control group, model control group, positive control group-Li kejun tablet group and three different dose (high, middle, low-dose) groups of SHSB granule. The peripheral hemogram, thymus index (TI), spleen index (SI), bone marrow nucleated cell (BMNC) and colony forming unit-spleen (CFU-S) were evaluated. The proliferation of bone marrow cells was determined. The in vitro cultured colony forming unit granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) was estimated. The index of CD34+ cell in BMNC were determined by flow cytometry. The ultra-micro structure of bone marrow were observed by electromicroscope.", "(1)SHSB rranule could increase the WBC of model mice; (2)SHSB granule could increase BMNC and promote the proliferation of bone marrow cell; (3)SHSB granule could increase CFU-S, CFU-GM and CD34+ cell index in BMNC of model mice significantly; (4)SHSB Granule could also protect the bone marrow hemotopoietic microenvironment from the harm of radiation; (5)SHSB granule could increase the SI of model mice, indicating the enhancement of immunological function.", "SHSB granule has apparent leukogenic function.
