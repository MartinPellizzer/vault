The analytical procedure is based on ultrasonic assisted extraction and liquid-liquid extraction (LLE). After solvents were added, the raw material or granule sample was sonicated in an ultrasonic water bath and then centrifuged, filtered, and cleaned up by LLE. The infusion sample was extracted with petroleum ether by LLE. The pesticide residues were determined by capillary gas chromatography with electron-capture or flame photometric detection. Recoveries with the method at concentrations between 0.4 microg/kg and 10 mg/kg ranged from 70.2 to 119.5% for raw material, 73.2 to 105.1% for granule formulation, and 72.8 to 113.3% for infusion formulation. The relative standard deviation values were <20% for all of the pesticides studied. The pesticide detection limits were within the ranges 0.3-0.5 microg/L for endosulfan, 3-7.5 microg/L for pyrethroids, 0.7-32.5 microg/L for organophosphorus pesticides, and 0.1-0.6 microg/L for the other pesticides. The proposed methods are simple and rapid and provide simultaneous determination of pesticide residues in Isatis indigotica Fort. with acceptable recoveries and repeatability and an adequate limit of determination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, Anhui, 230036, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yue", "ForeName": "Yongde", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hua", "ForeName": "Rimao", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Shimei", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J AOAC Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9215446", "ISSNLinking": "1060-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organophosphorus Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrethrins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OKA6A6ZD4K", "NameOfSubstance": "Endosulfan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Endosulfan"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Isatis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Organophosphorus Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrethrins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sonication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrasonics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16001845"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
