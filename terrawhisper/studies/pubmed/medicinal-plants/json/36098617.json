The ability of vaccines to protect immunocompromised individuals and from emerging new strains are major concerns. Hence antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 are essential. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease M<sup>pro</sup> is vital for replication and an important target for antivirals. Using CMap analysis and docking studies, withaferin A (wifA) and withanone (win), two natural products from the medicinal herb <i>Withania somnifera</i> (ashwagandha), were identified as promising candidates that can covalently inhibit the viral protease M<sup>pro</sup>. Cell culture, enzymatic, LC-MS/MS, computational, and equilibrium dialysis based assays were performed. DFT calculations indicated that wifA and win can form stable adducts with thiols. The cytotoxicity of M<sup>pro</sup> was significantly reduced by wifA and win. Both wifA and win were found to irreversibly inhibit 0.5 \u03bcM M<sup>pro</sup> with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.54 and 1.8 \u03bcM, respectively. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed covalent adduct formation with wifA at cysteines 145 and 300 of M<sup>pro</sup>. The natural products wifA and win can irreversibly inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease M<sup>pro</sup>. Based on the work presented here we propose that both wifA and win have the potential to be safely used as preventative and therapeutic interventions for COVID-19."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science, Shiv Nadar University, Greater Noida, UP 201314, India."}], "LastName": "Chakraborty", "ForeName": "Shayantani", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Presidency University, Kolkata 700073, India."}], "LastName": "Mallick", "ForeName": "Dibyendu", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3057-8239"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, School of Advanced Sciences, Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, TN 632014, India."}], "LastName": "Goswami", "ForeName": "Mausumi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7458-3048"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37235, United States."}], "LastName": "Guengerich", "ForeName": "F Peter", "Initials": "FP"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1609-8722"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science, Shiv Nadar University, Greater Noida, UP 201314, India."}], "LastName": "Chakrabarty", "ForeName": "Anindita", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1397-8684"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Independent Researcher, Greater Noida, UP 201314, India."}], "LastName": "Chowdhury", "ForeName": "Goutam", "Initials": "G"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 GM118122", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "3C-like proteinase, SARS-CoV-2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Cysteine Endopeptidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protease Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Nonstructural Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L6DO3QW4K5", "NameOfSubstance": "withaferin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GY036XA633", "NameOfSubstance": "withanone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19 Drug Treatment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cysteine Endopeptidases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pandemics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protease Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viral Nonstructural Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Withania"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36098617", "10.1021/acs.jnatprod.2c00521"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
