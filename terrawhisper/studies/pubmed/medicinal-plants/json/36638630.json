However, as a first-class carcinogen designated by IARC, clinical studies have shown that long-term chewing of areca nut is associated with oral mucosal diseases and even oral cancer. Moreover, the incidence of these diseases varies regionally, suggesting that it may be related to edible methods in different regions. In this study, UPLC-Q-TOF-MSE was combined with feature-based molecular networking to systematically characterise the chemical ingredients of areca nut. Based on these results, the ingredients of different edible parts and edible methods was rapidly compared. The compositional changes during the production process were also analysed. The obtained results provide a foundation for the scientific utilisation of areca nut."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
