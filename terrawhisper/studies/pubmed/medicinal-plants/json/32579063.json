The structure of caulerpin was characterized by IR, H<sup>1</sup>NMR, C<sup>13</sup> NMR, HSQC, HMBC, EI-MS spectroscopy. Antifungal results suggest that caulerpin has been inhibited <i>Cryptococcus neoformas</i> (12\u2009mm) and <i>Candida albicans</i> (7\u2009mm) than other microbes. <i>In vitro</i> anticancer activity of caulerpin has been explored by cell viability assay against new human cancer cell line (liver-HepG2). The results show that caulerpin has low IC<sub>50</sub> value (24.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1\u2009\u00b5g/mL) against HepG-2. Based on the least toxic activity of caulerpin, these results encourage for future <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> anticancer study. The binding of caulerpin molecule with the two nucleobases (T/U) bases has been studied by DFT methods. According to the AIM analysis, there are two types of interactions between caulerpin and T/U bases partially covalent partially electrostatic and electrostatic in gas and water phases. Based on NBO analysis, the charges were transferred from the lone-pair (n) in orbitals of O atoms of caulerpin to the \u03c3* orbitals of T/U bases atoms. \u0394E<sub>bin</sub> in the state of caulerpin-T bases complexes are lower than those in the caulerpin-U bases complexes in both gas and water phase. MD simulation supported that caulerpin-T/U bases complexes are stable in presence of explicit water phase. Thus, the findings of our study will be useful for giving an insight into the caulerpin/bases complexes that could be helpful in future experimental studies to develop the performance of caulerpin molecules as natural candidate drug.
