For 25\u00a0years, clinical pharmacologists researching BDS have confronted a litany of issues unlike those encountered with conventional medications. Foundational to these concerns is the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, which exempted BDS from premarket safety and efficacy trials. In the ensuing period, safety concerns regarding multi-ingredient products formulated as \"proprietary blends\" and herb-drug interactions have garnered significant attention. Idiosyncrasies unique to BDS can affect the outcome and interpretation of in vitro and in vivo studies, and although \"omics\" approaches hold promise in uncovering BDS efficacy mechanisms, purposeful adulteration threatens their safety. Despite a quarter century of public use, healthcare professionals still know little about BDS, thus it falls to industry, government, and academia to join forces in promoting a new paradigm for BDS research and product development."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA."}], "LastName": "Gurley", "ForeName": "Bill J", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."}], "LastName": "Yates", "ForeName": "Charles R", "Initials": "CR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacotherapy and Translational Research, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA."}], "LastName": "Markowitz", "ForeName": "John S", "Initials": "JS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Clin Pharmacol Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "0372741", "ISSNLinking": "0009-9236"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Consumer Product Safety"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "classification", "history", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herb-Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 21st Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patient Safety"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "classification", "history", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "classification", "history", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Terminology as Topic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29882958", "10.1002/cpt.1131"]}}]}
