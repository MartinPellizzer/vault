The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of pomegranate seed oil (PSO) on serum biochemical parameters, cardiomyopathy and nephropathy induced by diabetes mellitus.", "W/A adult rats were divided into four groups (12 each): group 1, received saline (1\u2009mL/kg), group 2, received streptozotocin (STZ, 65\u2009mg/kg, a single dose as i.p.), groups 3 and 4, received STZ\u2009+\u2009PSO (0.4 and 0.8\u2009mL/kg, daily by gavage, respectively). After three weeks, six rats of each group and one week later the remaining animals were anesthetized, blood samples were taken for measuring serum biochemical parameters. Sections of heart and kidneys were used for histopathological studies and the remaining tissues were homogenized for measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) and total sulfhydryl groups.", "Significant elevation of serum creatinine and urea, LDL, triglyceride, glucose levels as well as urine markers, MDA levels in tissue homogenates and a significant decrease in total thiol content and serum HDL were observed in STZ-treated group as compared with control group. PSO treatment resulted in a significant decrease in tissue MDA content, serum creatinine and urea levels as well as urine markers as compared with STZ-treated group. Lipid profile was ameliorated with PSO treatment. PSO also significantly reversed STZ-induced depletion in thiol content and histological abnormality. Effect of PSO was more specific at 28th than 21th days of study.", "The results showed that PSO has a protective effect against diabetes complications in rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran ;"}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran ;"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Neurocognitive Research Center, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran ;"}], "LastName": "Sadeghnia", "ForeName": "Hamid R", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran ;"}], "LastName": "Hoseini", "ForeName": "Azar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Ghem Hospital, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Farzadnia", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran ;"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran ;"}], "LastName": "Boroushaki", "ForeName": "Mohammad Taher", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ren Fail", "NlmUniqueID": "8701128", "ISSNLinking": "0886-022X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Creatine Kinase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiomyopathies"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Creatine Kinase"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lythraceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27453190", "10.1080/0886022X.2016.1207053"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
