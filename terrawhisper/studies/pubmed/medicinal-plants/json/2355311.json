The concentration of G in the plasma was determined by high performance liquid chromatography. It was found that the time required for a maximum concentration (Tmax) of G was 8 h after administration of licorice extract. On the other hand, G reached a maximum plasma concentration at less than 6 h after administration of G. The plasma level of G fell slowly within 24 h after their oral administration, and it was still detected in the plasma even after 24 h. The maximum concentration (Cmax) of G in the plasma after oral administration of licorice extract was somewhat lower than that of G. On the other hand, the area under the plasma-time curve (AUC24h) of G after oral administration of licorice extract was almost the same as that of G. The effects of licorice extract and G on excretive urine volume was also investigated in rats. Licorice extract and G, at the dose used in this experiment, did not show any effect as compared with a control group."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, National Institute of Hygienic Sciences, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ozaki", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Noguchi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kamakura", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Harada", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6FO62043WK", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P540XA09DR", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycyrrhetinic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "analogs & derivatives", "blood", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhetinic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2355311", "10.1248/yakushi1947.110.1_77"]}}]}
