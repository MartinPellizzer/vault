Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin. After 3\u00a0days, they were initiated CURC and PLAC solutions and insulin administrations, daily for 30\u00a0days. This included a period of 19\u00a0days prior to EP induction (ligature at the first mandibular and the second maxillary molar) and then additional 11\u00a0days. Specimens from the mandible were processed for morphometric examination of bone level. Gingival tissues from mandibular molars were collected for quantification of IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-17, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 using a Luminex/MAGpix assay. Gingivae from maxillary molars were subjected to RT-PCR for assessment of Runx2, RANKL, OPG, SIRT, Dkk1, and Sost levels.", "Lower linear bone loss was detected in ligated molars of DM\u00a0+\u00a0CURC\u00a0+\u00a0INS vs DM\u00a0+\u00a0PLAC and DM\u00a0+\u00a0INS groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In ligated sites from DM rats treated with CURC\u00a0+\u00a0INS, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, INF-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 levels were the lowest in comparison with PLAC and/or INS and CURC as monotherapies (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). CURC, independently of INS, increased Runx2 and SIRT when compared to DM\u00a0+\u00a0PLAC (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in ligated sites, whereas only CURC\u00a0+\u00a0INS reduced the RANKL/OPG ratio when compared to DM\u00a0+\u00a0PLAC (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).", "Natural CURC, when associated with INS, reduces the DM-induced loss of supporting alveolar bone and promotes favorable modulation on osteo-immune-inflammatory mediators."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
