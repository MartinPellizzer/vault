The drug is prepared from the dried roots of several morning glories, all of which have been identified as members of the genus Ipomoea. Analysis of several commercial samples was assessed by generating HPLC and 13C NMR spectroscopic profiles of the glycosidic acids obtained through saponification of the resin glycoside contents. These profiles distinguish the three Mexican jalaps currently in frequent use and can serve as analytical tools for the authentication and quality control of these purgative herbal drugs. Ipomoea purga, the authentic \"jalap root\", yielded two new hexasaccharides of convolvulinic and jalapinolic acids, purgic acids A (1) and B (2), respectively. Scammonic acid A (3), a tetrasaccharide, was produced from Ipomoea orizabensis, the Mexican scammony or false jalap. Operculinic acid B (4), a pentasaccharide, was identified in Ipomoea stans. Semipreparative HPLC was performed to obtain pure samples of new compounds 1 and 2 in sufficient quantity to elucidate their structure by high-field NMR spectroscopy. Purgic acid A (1) was identified as (11S)-hydroxytetradecanoic acid 11-O-beta-D-quinovopyranosyl-(1-->2)-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->3)-O-[beta-D-fucopyranosyl-(1-->4)]-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)-O-beta-D-quinovopyranoside, while purgic acid B (2) was characterized with (11S)-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid as its aglycon but having the same glycosidation sequence in the oligosaccharide core."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Farmacia, Facultad de Qu\u00edmica, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico City 04510 DF, Mexico. pereda@servidor.unam.mx"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pereda-Miranda", "ForeName": "Rogelio", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fragoso-Serrano", "ForeName": "Mabel", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Escalante-Sanchez", "ForeName": "Edgar", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hernandez-Carlos", "ForeName": "Beatriz", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Linares", "ForeName": "Edelmira", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bye", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cathartics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Resins, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "operculinic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "purgic acid A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "purgic acid B"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cathartics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ipomoea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Resins, Plant"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17067162", "10.1021/np060295f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
