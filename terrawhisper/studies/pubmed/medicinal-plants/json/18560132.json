Sixteen studies testing different HM were included. Out of the 15 HM monotherapy studies, 13 reported HM to be significantly better than OM or placebo; one reported similar efficacy between HM and OM. Only the HM adjuvant study reported significant efficacy. No major adverse events for HM were reported and HMs were found to reduce the adverse effects arising from OM. Imbalance in ethnicity among participants was observed; gender distribution was unclear. Heterogeneity in diagnostic criteria, interventions and outcome measures hindered comprehensive data analysis. Studies comparing HM with OM suggest that HM can be a safe, effective treatment for AD, either alone or in conjunction with OM. Methodological flaws in the design of the studies, however, limited the extent to which the results could be interpreted. Among various HMs, the safety and tolerability of EGb761 was best established. Further multi-center trials with large sample size, high methodological qualities and standardized HM ingredients are necessary for clinical recommendations on the use of HM in treating AD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Medicine, Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Man", "ForeName": "Sui Cheung", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Durairajan", "ForeName": "Siva Sundara Kumar", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kum", "ForeName": "Wan Fung", "Initials": "WF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Jia Hong", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jian Dong", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Ching Fung", "Initials": "CF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Vincent", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Alzheimers Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9814863", "ISSNLinking": "1387-2877"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nootropic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Nootropic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}], "NumberOfReferences": "117"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18560132", "10.3233/jad-2008-14209"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
