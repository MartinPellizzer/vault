These plants have been extensively used in traditional medicine for the treatment of various gastrointestinal diseases including abdominal colic. This study was conducted to determine the spasmolytic effect of DCD-684 (100% v/v) and its individual plant components on isolated rabbit jejunum (in vitro) and their possible mechanism of action. The effects were evaluated on spontaneous and pre-contracted tissues using KCl (80mM) and other contractile agonists including acetylcholine (0.3\u00b5M), carbamylcholine (0.3\u00b5M), serotonin (10 \u00b5M) and histamine (100\u00b5M) in the presence and absence of DCD-684. The various concentrations of DCD-684 (0.1-3% v/v) demonstrated spasmolytic effects on both spontaneous (IC50=0.75%) and KCl-induced contractions (IC<sub>50</sub>=1.6%), respectively. It also inhibited the contractions induced by acetylcholine (IC<sub>50</sub>=0.45%), carbamylcholine (IC<sub>50</sub>=0.95%), serotonin (IC50=0.95%) and histamine (IC<sub>50</sub>=0.87%). The DCD-684 exhibited synergistic effect due to its five plant components suggesting that spasmolytic cascade is probably governed by muscarinic and/or nicotinic receptors, serotonergic histaminergic, as well as calcium channel blocking mechanisms. Thereby, providing the pharmacological basis of its therapeutic use in the gastrointestinal motility disorders and related inflammatory ailments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, Dow Diagnostic Reference and Research Laboratory, Laboratory Animal Sciences, Dow International Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Roome", "ForeName": "Talat", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, Dow Diagnostic Reference and Research Laboratory, Laboratory Animal Sciences, Dow International Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan/ Medics Laboratories (Pvt.)
