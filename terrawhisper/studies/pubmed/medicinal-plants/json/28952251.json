The associated genetic parameters were calculated by POPGENE1.31. The systematic diagram of genetic relationship were clustered by TREECONW. The results showed that a total of 434 bands were produced by using 28 primers, of which 430 were polymorphic loci. There was a high level of genetic diversity among species (PPB=99.1%,Na=1.990 6,Ne=1.329 3,H=0.212 2,I=0.337 8). However, genetic diversity was lower within species, the average of genetic parameters wasPPB=16.8%,Na=1.168 2, Ne=1.073 0,H=0.043 7,I=0.067 7. The Nei's genetic differentiation coefficient was 0.794 0, that indicated that most of the genetic variation existed among species. By clustering analysis, different individuals gathered in the same group. The results confirmed that SCoT marker can be used as one of the effective methods to reveal the genetic diversity and relationship among medicinal species of Coptis."], "CopyrightInformation":
