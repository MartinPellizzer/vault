In the present study, the inhibitory effects of SSG on a thrombosis in rats, induced by endotoxin treatment were examined. The anti-thrombic properties of SSG were also investigated with respect to blood parameters. The extracts of SSG and five of the seven herbs, except Cnidii Rhizoma and Carthami Flos, inhibited both endotoxin-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and thrombosis in rats. The extract also inhibited the endotoxin-induced decrease in blood platelets and fibrinogen, and the endotoxin-induced increase in fibrin degradation products (FDP) on disseminated intravascular coagulation in normal rats. In conclusion, the artificially induced, protective effects of SSG on ischemic infarction might be related to their inhibitory effects on DIC, platelet coagulation and thrombotic action."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Diagnosis, Dongguk University COM and National Research Laboratory for Glycobiology, Korean Ministry of Science and Technology, KyungJu, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Won-Hwan", "Initials": "WH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "Jong-Chan", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyung-Min", "Initials": "HM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Young-Choon", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Cheorl-Ho", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fibrinolytic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "silsosangami"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Fibrinolytic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15103669", "10.1002/ptr.1429"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
