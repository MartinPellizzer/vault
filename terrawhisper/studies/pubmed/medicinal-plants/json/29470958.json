Despite the extensive studies on pharmacological activities, the toxicity or undesirable effects of AMF are rarely reported. In this study, the inhibitory effects of AMF on human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) were carefully investigated. AMF displayed strong inhibition towards most of human UGTs including UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A7, 1A8, 1A9, 1A10, 2B4 and 2B17, with the IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.12\u202f\u03bcM to 16.81\u202f\u03bcM. Inhibition constants (K<sub>i</sub>) of AMF against various human UGTs varied from 0.29\u202f\u03bcM to 11.51\u202f\u03bcM. Further investigation demonstrated that AMF was a noncompetitive inhibitor of UGT1A1 mediated NCHN-O-glucuronidation but functioned as a competitive inhibitor of UGT1A1 mediated 4-MU-O-glucuronidation. In addition, AMF was a competitive inhibitor of UGT1A4 mediated TFP-N-glucuronidation in both UGT1A4 and human liver microsomes, while functioned as a competitive inhibitor of UGT1A9 mediated propofol or 4-MU-O-glucuronidation. These findings demonstrated that AMF was a strong and broad-spectrum natural inhibitor of most human UGTs, which might bring potential risks of herb-drug interactions (HDIs) via UGT inhibition. Additionally, this study provided novel insights into the underlying mechanism of AMF-associated toxicity from the perspective of UGT inhibition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
