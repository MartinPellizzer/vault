In this report, we have studied the ability of Anacardium occidentale bark extract to neutralize enzymatic as well as pharmacological effects induced by Vipera russelii venom. The extract neutralized the viper venom hydrolytic enzymes such as phospholipase, protease, and hyaluronidase in a dose dependent manner. These enzymes are responsible for both local effects of envenomation such as local tissue damage, inflammation and myonecrosis, and systemic effects including dysfunction of vital organs and alteration in the coagulation components. In addition, extract neutralized the pharmacological effects such as edema, hemorrhage, and myotoxic effects including lethality, induced by venom. Since, it inhibits both hydrolytic enzymes and pharmacological effects; it may be used as an alternative treatment to serum therapy and, in addition, as a rich source of potential inhibitors of hydrolytic enzymes involved in several physiopathological diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Mysore, Manasagangothri, Mysore, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ushanandini", "ForeName": "Sampath", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nagaraju", "ForeName": "Shivaiah", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nayaka", "ForeName": "Siddaiah Chandra", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Krishnegowda Harish", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kemparaju", "ForeName": "Kempaiah", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Girish", "ForeName": "Kesturu Subbaiah", "Initials": "KS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8800150", "ISSNLinking": "0892-3973"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunosuppressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viper Venoms"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Anacardium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunosuppressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Bark"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Snakes"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Viper Venoms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19874230", "10.3109/08923970902911909"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
