The growth rate and saponin content of the cells cultured in such medium (KNO33300 mg/l) increased 65.1% and 166.2% respectively as compared with that cultured in the regular medium. The application of oligosaccharins from Panax ginseng and Dendrobium candidum also increased their saponin content and growth rate. Especially, the content of Rg group saponins was apparently raised. It took more than 25 days for the cell suspension cultures to produce saponins in large amounts. The curve of saponin formation lagged slightly behind the growth curve in cell suspension culture and fermentation culture. The cell fermentation culture with a stabilized pH value was better than the culture with the pH value changing spontaneously on saponin content, growth rate and biomass. Finally, the culture patterns of P. quinque folium cells were compared and discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kumming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "L G", "Initials": "LG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "G Z", "Initials": "GZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "S L", "Initials": "SL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Chin J Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "9100855", "ISSNLinking": "1042-749X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2132128"]}}]}
