Male laboratory-bred Swiss albino mice were given one of three concentrations of the freshly prepared extract (100 mg, 50 mg, and 25 mg/kg body weight) as a dietary supplement by gavage for 6 consecutive days. On the seventh day the mice were administered a single acute dose of two known clastogens, mitomycin C(1.5 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (25 mg/kg) or sodium arsenite (2.5 mg/kg), simultaneously with garlic extract. After 24 hr, chromosome preparations were made from the bone marrow cells. The endpoint studied were chromosomal aberrations and damaged cells. Garlic extract alone induced a low level of chromosomal damage. The clastogenicity of all three mutagens were reduced significantly in the animals which had been given garlic extract as dietary supplement. The extent of reduction was different for the three clastogens and may be attributed to the interaction with the different components of the extract."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Calcutta, India."}], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Roychoudhury", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Talukder", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Mol Mutagen", "NlmUniqueID": "8800109", "ISSNLinking": "0893-6692"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "48OVY2OC72", "NameOfSubstance": "sodium arsenite"}, {"RegistryNumber": "50SG953SK6", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitomycin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8N3DW7272P", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclophosphamide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N712M78A8G", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Arsenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arsenites"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Marrow"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Aberrations"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclophosphamide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mitomycin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8491218", "10.1002/em.2850210410"]}}]}
