Meanwhile, studies on the sensory quality of HSs showed that EOs composition does not translate to the profile of volatiles emitted from plants; therefore, they do not provide a background for sensory quality assessment. Thus, in this study, the differences in the composition of the EOs and the patterns of emission of unlimited (pure EOs) or limited (presence of a plant matrix) volatiles by headspace were measured for three chemotypes of mint, namely menthol, carvone, and linalool ones. The results have demonstrated that the presence of a plant matrix may change the contribution of main volatiles even up to 47 percentage points, what allows suggesting that EOs chemical analysis is not a reliable method for the determination of sensory quality of HSs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
