The objective of this review is to present up-to-date information from the scientific literature about the phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology of Bistorta. At present, there is a lack of a comprehensive review that consolidates the various scientific studies conducted on the genus Bistorta. To address this knowledge gap, a global review has been compiled on the genus Bistorta, which emphasizes ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacology. To gather information about Bistorta, relevant keywords were used to search internet databases including Google scholar, PubMed, ResearchGate, Web of Science, Europe PMC, CNKI, and Wiley Online Library. Additionally, published books that provided an overview of existing literature studies were consulted for reference purposes. Chemical structures and formulas of compounds were verified using the PubChem database and drawn using Chem Draw Ultra 6.0. The scientific nomenclature utilized in this review follows The World Flora Online and The Plant of the World Online (PoWo). A comprehensive evaluation of literature sources revealed that the genus Bistorta has been recognized for its ethnomedical properties and has been used in traditional healthcare for several millennia. Chemical analysis has identified various compounds such as phenolics, flavonoids saponins, terpenes, sterols, and coumarins which have been shown to have significant pharmacological effects such as anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant anti-rheumatic and anti-microbial properties. The pharmacological research has only partially validated the traditional and local uses of Bistorta species. Further research is required to investigate the mechanisms of the plant's active compounds, as well as its potential therapeutic applications in treating conditions like diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, there is no clinical evidence to provide the health benefits of these plants. To confirm the pharmacological activities, clinical efficacy, and non-toxicity of Bistorta species, more comprehensive and systematic preclinical studies, and clinical trials are needed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
