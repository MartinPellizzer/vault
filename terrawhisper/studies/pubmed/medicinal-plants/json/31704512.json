There are several processes which can cause AD, including mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated oxidative stress (OS), intracellular buildup of hyper-phosphorylated tau as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and excessive buildup of extracellular amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaques, and/or genetic as well as the environmental factors. Existing treatments can only provide symptomatic relief via providing temporary palliative therapy which can weaken the rate of AD-associated cognitive decline. Plants are the fundamental building blocks for the environment and produce various secondary metabolites. Biflavonoids are one among such secondary metabolite that possesses the potential to mediate noticeable change in the aggregation of tau, A\u03b2 and also efficiently can decrease the toxic effects of A\u03b2 oligomers in comparison with the monoflavonoid moieties. Nevertheless, the molecular processes remain to be exposed, flavonoids are found to cause a change in the A\u03b2 and tau aggregation pathway to generate non-toxic aggregates. In this review, we discuss the neuroprotective action of small molecule biflavonoid to reduce the neurodegenerative events of AD. Furthermore, this appraisal advances our knowledge to develop potential new targets for the treatment of AD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
