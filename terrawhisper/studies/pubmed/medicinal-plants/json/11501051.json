MAO activity was determined radiochemically with [14C]5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and [14C]beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA) used as MAO A or B specific radiolabled substrates, respectively. The Ki and KI values were obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plot using linear regression analysis.", "Liquiritigenin and isoliquiritigenin were found to be inhibitory against both MAO A and B in a dose-dependent manner. IC50 (95% of confidence limits) of liquiritigenin and isoliquiritigenin were 32 (26-36) and 13.9 (12.8-15.6) mumol/L for the inhibition of MAO A, and 104.6 (89.0-118.9) and 47.2 (39.5-54.5) mumol/L for that of MAO B, respectively. Lineweaver-Burk transformation of the MAO A inhibition data indicated that the inhibition was non-competitive for both liquiritigenin and isoliquiritigenin whereas their inhibition of MAO B was of mixed type. Regarding MAO A inhibition, the Ki values of liquiritigenin and isoliquiritigenin were 31.5 mumol/L and 14.3 mumol/L, respectively. As to the inhibition of MAO B, the Ki and KI data for liquiritigenin were 164.7 and 15.2 mumol/L, and those for isoliquiritigenin were 62.2 and 9.3 mumol/L, respectively.", "Liquiritigenin and isoliquiritigen inhibited the activity of MAO A and B in rat brain mitochondria, and the latter was more active than the former."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Functional Biomolecules, State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "L D", "Initials": "LD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "R X", "Initials": "RX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5S5A2Q39HX", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "B9CTI9GB8F", "NameOfSubstance": "isoliquiritigenin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.3.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoamine Oxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T194LKP9W6", "NameOfSubstance": "liquiritigenin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chalcone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chalcones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavanones"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Monoamine Oxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11501051"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
