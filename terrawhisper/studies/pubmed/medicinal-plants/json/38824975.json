Walp. (Leguminosae) methanol (80%) leaf extract and solvent fractions against Plasmodium berghei-induced malaria in mice model.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "118413", "MedlinePgn": "118413"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Novel drugs are needed to address the issue of malarial infection resistance; natural items can be a different source of these medications. Albizia malacophylla (A. Rich.) Walp. (Leguminosae) is listed as one of the antimalarial medicinal plants in Ethiopian folk medicine. However, there are no reports regarding the biological activity or phytochemistry of the plant.", "Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the A. malacophylla crude extract and solvent fractions' in vivo antimalarial activity utilizing 4-day suppressive, preventative, and curative tests in mice infected with P. berghei.", "The parasite Plasmodium berghei, which causes rodent malaria, was used to infect healthy male Swiss Albino mice, weighing 23-28\u00a0g and aged 6-8 weeks. Solvent fractions such as methanol, water, and chloroform were given in addition to an 80% methanolic extract at 100, 200, and 400\u00a0mg/kg doses. A Conventional test such as parasitemia, survival time, body weight, temperature, and packed cell capacity were employed to ascertain factors such as the suppressive, curative, and preventive tests.", "Every test substance dramatically reduced the number of parasites in every experiment. Crude extract (with the highest percentage suppression of 67.78%) performs better antimalarial effect than the methanol fraction, which is the most efficient solvent fraction with a percentage suppression of 55.74%. With a suppression value of 64.83% parasitemia level, the therapeutic effects of 80% methanolic crude extract were greater than its curative and preventative effects in a four-day suppressive test. The survival period (17 days) was longer with the hydroalcoholic crude extract dose of 400\u00a0mg/kg than with other doses of the materials under investigation.", "The results of this investigation validate the antimalarial characteristics of A. malacophylla leaf extract. The crude extract prevented weight loss, a decline in temperature, and a reduction in PCV. The results demonstrate that the plant has a promising antimalarial effect against P. berghei, hence supporting the traditional use of the plant. Therefore, it could serve as a foundation for the development of new antimalarial drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
