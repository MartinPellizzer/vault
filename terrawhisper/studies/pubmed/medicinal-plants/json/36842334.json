Due to the heterogeneity and non-standardization of the processing procedures, the subtypes and contents of the differential compounds between different processed products still remained indistinct, causing great risk in their proper use. In order to achieve the comparison and quality evaluation of different processed products of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata and develop new processed products with less toxicity, a quantification and pseudotargeted metabolomics method was developed based on the dynamic MRM mode of triple quadrupole (QqQ) mass spectrometry, and multivariate statistical analysis methods were applied to compare different processed products. Method validation results indicated good specificity, linearity, repeatability, precision, stability and recovery of the established quantification method and good linearity, precision and stability of the pseudotargeted metabolomics method. Differential compounds of different processed products were screened out and further confirmed by the quantification results. At last, the processing procedures were optimized to obtain new processed products of \"Heishunpian\" (black slices) with less toxicity, in which the contents of the toxic diester-type diterpenoid alkaloids were reduced from 106.98\u00a0\u03bcg/g to 0.85-12.96\u00a0\u03bcg/g. This study provided a valuable reference for the establishment of comprehensive quality evaluation methods of herbal medicines and a scientific basis for the optimization of processing procedures of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
