It was observed that the activities of serum marker enzymes, hepatic enzymes and NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation were significantly elevated after treatment with CCl4. However, in rats given Liv-52 at the same time as CCl4, the levels of all the marker enzymes were closer to those found in control animals. A similar trend was seen in the case of lipid peroxidation after Liv-52 treatment. CCl4 alone caused severe liver damage, but when Liv-52 was simultaneously given, there was much less effect on the structure of the organ. Circulating T3 and T4 concentrations were also determined after 6 weeks of simultaneous treatment with Liv-52 and CCl4. Concentrations of T3 were significantly lowered after CCl4 treatment alone, but Liv-52 administration together with CCl4 resulted in maintenance of the T3 activity within normal limits, thus suggesting indirect beneficial effects of Liv-52 on the regulation of thyroid hormone concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics, Panjab University, India."}], "LastName": "Dhawan", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Goel", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Res Exp Med (Berl)", "NlmUniqueID": "0324736", "ISSNLinking": "0300-9130"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thyroid Hormones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "06LU7C9H1V", "NameOfSubstance": "Triiodothyronine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "54847-94-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Liv 52"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CL2T97X0V0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q51BO43MG4", "NameOfSubstance": "Thyroxine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Thyroid Hormones"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Thyroxine"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triiodothyronine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8091017", "10.1007/BF02576381"]}}]}
