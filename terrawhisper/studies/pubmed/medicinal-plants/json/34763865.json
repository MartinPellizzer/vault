The phytohormone auxin is a crucial regulator of almost every process involved in plant growth and development. Several studies have demonstrated the involvement of miRNA(s) in the regulation of the auxin signaling pathway and plant development. However, very few studies have identified the auxin-mediated regulation of miRNA(s). In this study, we reveal the detailed mechanism of auxin-mediated regulation of the cell wall-related miR775- Galactosyl transferase (GalT) module, which plays an important role in root growth in Arabidopsis thaliana. We also showed two interdependent mechanisms by which miR775 regulates root growth: miR775-GalT and light-mediated sucrose-dependent pathways. Treatment of GUS reporter lines with Indole Acetic Acid (IAA), sucrose, and light apparently enhanced the abundance of miR775 in root tissue. miR775 overexpressing (miR775OX) lines showed changes in root architecture, including increased primary root growth and root hair, by targeting GalT. miR775OX lines also showed tolerance toward low Pi. These results provide new insights into the auxin regulation of cell wall-related miR775 and suggest its significant role in plant root growth and development by modifying the cell wall."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR-NBRI), Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow, 226001, India; Department of Botany, University of Lucknow, Lucknow, 226007, India."}], "LastName": "Gaddam", "ForeName": "Subhash Reddy", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR-NBRI), Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow, 226001, India; Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Bhatia", "ForeName": "Chitra", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR-NBRI), Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow, 226001, India; Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Ashish", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR-NBRI), Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow, 226001, India; Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Badola", "ForeName": "Poorwa Kamal", "Initials": "PK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Lucknow, Lucknow, 226007, India."}], "LastName": "Saxena", "ForeName": "Gauri", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR-NBRI), Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow, 226001, India; Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, 201002, India; CSIR- Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CSIR-CIMAP) P.O.
