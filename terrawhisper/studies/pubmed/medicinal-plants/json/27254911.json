Light response curve data showed the ability of using the strongest light was in June. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters values also displayed that, openness of reflect center and photochemical efficiency of leaves' photosystem II were the highest, which also had the fastest rate of electron transfer in June. Morphological indicators showed that the single leaf area and leaf area of Inula nervosa were significantly higher in June than those in other months. The content of total phenols were much higher than that of total flavonoids in Inula nervosa. And the medicinal ingredient content of the underground part was higher than that in the aerial part.", "The best harvest time of underground part of Inula nervosa should be after autumn, when the weight and active ingredients are accumulated to a considerable level."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "An-na", "Initials": "AN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Li-xue", "Initials": "LX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Xian-jin", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Shui-ping", "Initials": "SP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosystem II Protein Complex"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Inula"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Photosystem II Protein Complex"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27254911"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
