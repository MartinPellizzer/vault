Anisaldehyde/sulfuric acid reagent and thymol/sulfuric acid reagent were used to visualize separated components on the chromatograms. Antioxidant activity and \u03b1-amylase inhibition were assessed with 2 bioassays, DPPH assay to detect free radical scavengers and starch-iodineassay method to detect compounds that inhibit \u03b1-amylase. The highest antioxidant activity of 10.12\u00a0\u03bcg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per 20\u00a0\u00b5L of extract was measured in extract from Tagetes flowers and the lowest in the extract from Calendula leaves with 5.10\u00a0\u03bcg of GAE. Multiple zones of \u03b1-amylase inhibition were detected. A detailed analysis of the ATR-FTIR spectra from the bands at R<sub>F</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.24 suggest that faradiol esters and saturated fatty acids esters, palmitic acid, myristic acid, and lauric acid are responsible for \u03b1-amylase inhibition, unsaturated fatty acids for the band at R<sub>F</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.51 and phytoecdysteroids for the band at R<sub>F</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.53."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
