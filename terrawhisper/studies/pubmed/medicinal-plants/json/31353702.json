Both EFAA and 4,5-diCQA were effective in improving cognitive function on HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction. In brain tissue analysis, it was confirmed that EFAA and 4,5-diCQA inhibited the reduction of neurotransmitters as well as oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, they inhibited amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation by increasing the expression of insulin-degrading enzyme and consequently prevented apoptosis. In conclusion, it is presumed that Artemisia argyi may help to improve the cognitive impairment due to the HFD, and it is considered that this effect is closely related to the physiological activity of 4,5-diCQA. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Artemisia argyi is used in traditional herbal medicine in Asia. Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been proven by a variety of epidemiological studies to be a risk factor for cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease. This study confirmed that 4,5-diCQA is a bioactive compound of Artemisia argyi on improving HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction. Therefore, this study can provide useful information to the effect of Artemisia argyi and related substance."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 plus), Institute of Agriculture and Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Jin Yong", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 plus), Institute of Agriculture and Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Seon Kyeong", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 plus), Institute of Agriculture and Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jong Min", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 plus), Institute of Agriculture and Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Su Bin", "Initials": "SB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 plus), Institute of Agriculture and Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Yoo", "ForeName": "Seul Ki", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 plus), Institute of Agriculture and Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Hye Ju", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Dae Ok", "Initials": "DO"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3560-2007"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 plus), Institute of Agriculture and Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Heo", "ForeName": "Ho Jin", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "7706045", "ISSNLinking": "0145-8884"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "caffeoylquinic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "058C04BGYI", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.56", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulysin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cognitive Dysfunction"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Diet, High-Fat"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Insulysin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quinic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31353702", "10.1111/jfbc.12855"]}}]}
