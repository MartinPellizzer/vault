In order to extract the information of local Chinese medicinal materials more quickly and simply,we try to apply remote sensing technology to the extraction of Chinese medicinal materials. This paper will use Weiyuan county of Gansu province as the research area,and use the domestic ZY-3 Satellite multi-spectral remote sensing image as the data source to find out the spectral characteristics of the party's participation in other remote sensing images. The visual interpretation method was used to extract the planting area of the C. pilosula in Weiyuan county. The estimated value of the planting area of C. pilosula using satellite remote sensing technology was 75 965 mu( 1 mu\u2248667 m<sup>2</sup>),which was basically consistent with the field survey data of the local medicinal materials office. After the accuracy verification,it was found that the precision of C. pilosula planted by visual interpretation was more than 70%. It is concluded that the satellite remote sensing technology can be used to extract the information of C. pilosula and it can provide the relevant information of the planting area of Chinese medicinal materials quickly and accurately."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy,Gansu University of Chinese Medicine Lanzhou 730000,China."}], "LastName": "Lyu", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy,Gansu University of Chinese Medicine Lanzhou 730000,China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Fei-Fei", "Initials": "FF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy,Gansu University of Chinese Medicine Lanzhou 730000,China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Wei-Wei", "Initials": "WW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy,Gansu University of Chinese Medicine Lanzhou 730000,China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs,Chinese Medicine Resource Center,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs,Chinese Medicine Resource Center,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Ting-Ting", "Initials": "TT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy,Gansu University of Chinese Medicine Lanzhou 730000,China Research Institute of Chinese( Tibetan) Medicinal Resources Lanzhou 730000,China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Codonopsis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Remote Sensing Technology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31872687", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190731.108"]}}]}
