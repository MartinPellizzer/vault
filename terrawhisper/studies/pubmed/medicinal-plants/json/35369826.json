(cv. Le-Conte) (pears) and <i>Malus domestica</i> Borkh. (cv. Anna) (apples) are economic fruit crops cultivated in Egypt. Their leaves were assessed for their beta-sitosterol content and found to have 9.4\u2009mg/g dried leaves wt and 5\u2009mg/g dried leaves, respectively. So we used the lipoidal leaves extracts in the formulation of eight beta-sitosterol-rich emulgels from which the most stable formulae were tested for their antimicrobial activity. Finally, the formulae which exerted antimicrobial activity were biologically evaluated for wound healing against well-known wound healing ointment Mebo\u00ae which is composed mainly of 0.25% beta-sitosterol in a base of sesame oil and beeswax. Wound contraction was statistically different in both formulae F3 and F8 from both control and Mebo<sup>\u00ae</sup> groups which indicated better wound healing activity of these formulae ensured by further histopathological study of the healed wounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Plants and Natural Products, National Organization for Drug Control and Research (NODCAR), recently Egyptian Drug Authority (EDA), Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hammam", "ForeName": "Walaa E", "Initials": "WE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, National Organization for Drug Control and Research (NODCAR), recently Egyptian Drug Authority (EDA), Giza, Egypt."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Sinai University, El Ismailia, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Gad", "ForeName": "Amany M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, National Organization for Drug Control and Research (NODCAR), recently Egyptian Drug Authority (EDA), Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Gad", "ForeName": "Mary K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Kirollos", "ForeName": "Farid N", "Initials": "FN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Medical Research Division, National Research Centre, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Yassin", "ForeName": "Nemat A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Plants and Natural Products, National Organization for Drug Control and Research (NODCAR), recently Egyptian Drug Authority (EDA), Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Tantawi", "ForeName": "Mona Elmahdy El", "Initials": "MEE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "El Hawary", "ForeName": "Seham Salah Eldin", "Initials": "SSE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "5LI01C78DD", "NameOfSubstance": "gamma-sitosterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Malus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pyrus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35369826", "10.1080/14786419.2022.2056181"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
