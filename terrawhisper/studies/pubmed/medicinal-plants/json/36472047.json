The development concept of Chinese materia medica(CMM) ecological agriculture and the emergence of new technologies provide momentum for the supply of high-quality green ecological products. As special ecological products, Dao-di herbs have medicinal, economic, ecological, and cultural values. The ecological planting of CMM and the value realization of ecological products are of great significance for the high-quality development of CMM agriculture and for prospering agriculture by improving quality. Therefore, this paper reviews the development status and typical cases, and puts forward the advantages of ecological product value realization of Dao-di herbs. On this basis, a value accounting system for ecological products of CMM was constructed from three aspects: supply services, ecological services, and cultural services. Finally, the suggestions for realizing the value of CMM ecological products are put forward.(1)It is suggested to strengthen the practice of ecological planting and production of CMM, and innovate the value realization model of ecological products.(2)The ecological planting bases of Dao-di herbs should be constructed to enhance the supply capacity of high-quality ecological products.(3)The quality and safety of ecological CMM should be improved to create the ecological planting brand of Dao-di herbs.(4)The ecological product value system and mechanism should be improved for realizing the value of CMM ecological products.(5)The education and publicity should be strengthened to raise the public awareness of the value of CMM ecological products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Chuan-Zhi", "Initials": "CZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Lyu", "ForeName": "Chao-Geng", "Initials": "CG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Sheng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Xiu-Fu", "Initials": "XF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The National Agro-Tech Extension and Service Center Beijing 100125, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Jing-Yi", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology Kunming 650031, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "33"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36472047", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220515.104"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
