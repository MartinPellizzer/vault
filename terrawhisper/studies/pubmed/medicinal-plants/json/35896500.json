However, the taraxerol content in medicinal plants is low, and chemical extraction requires considerable energy and time, so taraxerol production is a problem. It is a promising strategy to produce taraxerol by applying recombinant microorganisms. In this study, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain WKde2 was constructed to produce taraxerol with a titer of 1.85\u00a0mg\u00b7l-1, and the taraxerol titer was further increased to 12.51\u00a0mg\u00b7l-1 through multiple metabolic engineering strategies. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) size regulatory factor INO2, which was reported to increase squalene and cytochrome P450-mediated 2,3-oxidosqualene production, was overexpressed in this study, and the resultant strain WTK11 showed a taraxerol titer of 17.35\u00a0mg\u00b7l-1. Eventually, the highest reported titer of 59.55\u00a0mg\u00b7l-1 taraxerol was achieved in a 5\u00a0l bioreactor. These results will serve as a general strategy for the production of other triterpenoids in yeast."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.
