Often, our industry has had to introduce best practices and self-regulation to ensure the safety of our products and customers, as well as to help any regulating body in building such frameworks. This article will focus on how OutCo has implemented Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) protocols to ensure the safety of every aspect of the production pipeline. The prevention of mold growth in drying flowers would be a classic example of food safety and is our prime example of how HACCP has informed our approach to this task. HACCP also contributed to the prevention of pesticide contamination, worker safety, and cannabis oil formulation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "OutCo, 8157 Wing Ave, El Cajon, CA 92020."}], "LastName": "Roggen", "ForeName": "Markus", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J AOAC Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9215446", "ISSNLinking": "1060-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cannabis"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Safety"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Food-Processing Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30157992", "10.5740/jaoacint.18-0205"]}}]}
