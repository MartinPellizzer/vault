The product, available as an over-the-counter dietary supplement, is not considered a drug and therefore does not require approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Preliminary data suggest that SPV-30 is effective in increasing CD4 and CD8 counts while decreasing viral load in patients with HIV. About 200 HIV-positive Americans have already enrolled in the U.S. study. Those interested may receive a free six-month supply of SPV-30 in exchange for filling out a questionnaire and sending in complete blood work and a battery of tests. For more information about the trial, contact Boston AIDS activist David Stokes at (614) 424-9195."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": [], "GeneralNote": [], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "11362383", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1995", "Month": "05", "Day": "25"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1523-2883", "JournalIssue": {"PubDate": {"Year": "1995", "Season": "May-Jun"}}, "Title": "Positively aware : the monthly journal of the Test Positive Aware Network", "ISOAbbreviation": "Posit Aware"}, "ArticleTitle": "SPV-30 may offer CD4 increase.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "7", "MedlinePgn": "7"}, "PublicationTypeList": ["Newspaper Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Posit Aware", "NlmUniqueID": "9413754", "ISSNLinking": "1523-2883"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Placebos"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "CD4 Lymphocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "HIV Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Placebos"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11362383"]}}]}
