However, the status of hypoxia-driven genes in HCC is largely unknown. In the present study, 368 HCC tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas were divided into high and low hypoxia groups according to their hypoxia signatures. A total of 1,142 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the two groups, and 34 of these DEGs were highly expressed in HCC tissues compared with adjacent tissues, especially in HCC tissues from patients with stage III-IV HCC. After constructing a protein-protein interaction network and applying the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression method for 34 DEGs, a three-gene signature (complement factor H related 3 [<i>CFHR3</i>], egl-9 family hypoxia inducible factor 3 [<i>EGLN3</i>], and chromogranin A [<i>CHGA</i>]) was constructed and had prognostic value to predicted outcome of patients with HCC. This three-gene signature was suitable for classifying patients with HCC in the International Cancer Genome Consortium. CFHR3 shows remarkable diagnostic value in HCC. Hypoxia decreased CFHR3 expression, but increased HCC cell proliferation and motility. Overexpression of CFHR3 in HCC cells under hypoxia reversed the stimulatory effects of hypoxia and suppressed cell proliferation and metastasis <i>in vivo</i>. In conclusion, we identified a novel hypoxia-driven gene signature (<i>CFHR3, EGLN3</i>, and <i>CHGA</i>) for reliable prognostic prediction of HCC, and demonstrated that overexpression of CFHR3 may be a potential strategy to overcome hypoxia and treat HCC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pathogenesis & Drug Research on Common Chronic Diseases, Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Zhirui", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3789-4186"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pathogenesis & Drug Research on Common Chronic Diseases, Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pathogenesis & Drug Research on Common Chronic Diseases, Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jingya", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yushi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pathogenesis & Drug Research on Common Chronic Diseases, Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Lan", "ForeName": "Jinzhi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pathogenesis & Drug Research on Common Chronic Diseases, Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Qianting", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pathogenesis & Drug Research on Common Chronic Diseases, Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Precision Medicine Research Institute of Guizhou Medical University, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Tengxiang", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Xiaojiang", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Bioengineered", "NlmUniqueID": "101581063", "ISSNLinking": "2165-5979"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers, Tumor"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoxia"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prognosis"}], "CoiStatement": "No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s)."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Serper M, Parikh ND, Thiele G, et al.
