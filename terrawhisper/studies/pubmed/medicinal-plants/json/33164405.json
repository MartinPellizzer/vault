Secondary metabolites are important raw materials of pharmaceutical and chemical industry, which have attracted extensive attention due to their economic and medicinal value. With the development of biotechnology, plant hormones have played an important role in regulating the synthesis of secondary metabolites. This paper mainly introduces the synthesis pathway, signal transduction mechanism and regulation of secondary metabolites of auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin, abscisic acid, ethylene, brassinosteroids and methyl jasmonate in plants. Researching the accumulation of secondary metabolites from a micro aspect is helpful to better understand the formation of plant hormones and their development in the process of secondary metabolism. In additionally, it provides a reference for the rational utilization of plant hormones and the scientific and efficient improvement of the production of secondary metabolites in plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Capital Medical University Beijing 100069, China."}], "LastName": "Rui", "ForeName": "Zhang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Capital Medical University Beijing 100069, China."}], "LastName": "Xiu-Juan", "ForeName": "Wang", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Capital Medical University Beijing 100069, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Gao", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Brassinosteroids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gibberellins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "72S9A8J5GW", "NameOfSubstance": "Abscisic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abscisic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brassinosteroids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gibberellins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "40"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33164405", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190129.007"]}}]}
