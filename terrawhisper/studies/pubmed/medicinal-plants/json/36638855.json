Certain species have been reported to have significant therapeutic effects in fever, inflammatory disorders, cancer, gastric ulcer, virus infection and other diseases.", "we performed a comprehensive review of the ten-year research progress in phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicity, along with bibliometrics research of the genus Bupleurum, aiming to identify knowledge gaps for future research.", "All the literatures are retrieved from library and electronic sources including Web of Science, PubMed, Elsevier, Google Scholar, CNKI and Baidu Scholar. These papers cover studies of the traditional use, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology of the genus Bupleurum.", "There is a long history of using the genus Bupleurum in traditional herbal medicine that dated back to over 2000 years ago. Twenty-five species and 8 varieties with 3 variants within this genus have been reported to be effective to treat fever, pain, liver disease, inflammation, thoracolumbar pain, irregular menstruation and rectal prolapse. The main phytochemicals found in these plants are triterpene saponins, volatile oil, flavonoid, lignans, and polysaccharides. Many of these compounds have also been shown to have anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antimicrobial, immunoregulation, neuroregulation, hepatoprotective and antidiabetic activities. Meanwhile, improper usage of Bupleurum may induce cytotoxic effects, and polyacetylenes may be the main poisonous compounds.", "This article summarized recent findings about Bupleurum research from many different aspects. While a small number of Bupleurum species have been investigated through modern pharmacology methods, there are still major knowledge gaps due to inadequate studies and ambiguous findings. Future research could focus on more specific phytochemistry studies combined with mechanistic analysis to provide better guidance to utilize Bupleurum as medicinal resources."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
