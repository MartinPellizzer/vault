Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in stroke pathogenesis and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are prominent targets for ROS management. Although recent research has shown antioxidant effect of berberine (BBR), little is known regarding its effect upon ROS-PPARs signaling in stroke. The aim of this study is to explore whether BBR could target on ROS-PPARs pathway to ameliorate middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced stroke. Herein, we report that BBR is able to scavenge ROS in oxidation-damaged C17.2 neural stem cells and stroked mice. PPAR\u03b4, rather than PPAR\u03b1 or PPAR\u03b3, is involved in the anti-ROS effect of BBR, as evidenced by the siRNA transfection and specific antagonist treatment data. Further, we have found BBR could upregulate NF-E2 related factor-1/2 (NRF1/2) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) following a PPAR\u03b4-dependent manner. Mechanistic study has revealed that BBR acts as a potent ligand (Kd\u00a0=\u00a0290\u00a0\u00b1\u00a092\u00a0nM) to activate PPAR\u03b4 and initiates the transcriptional regulation functions, thus promoting the expression of PPAR\u03b4, NRF1, NRF2 and NQO1. Collectively, our results indicate that BBR confers neuroprotective effects by activating PPAR\u03b4 to scavenge ROS, providing a novel mechanistic insight for the antioxidant action of BBR."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
