However, the volatile composition of the herb remained unclear. Apart from that, the extraction of volatile compounds through essential oil presents challenges due to the low yield and the degradation of volatile active compounds at high temperatures. This study used multiple sample preparation methods including headspace (HS), needle trap device (NTD), and liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to analyze the volatile compounds from the areal part of P. harmala L.. A total of 93 compounds were identified with NTD facilitating the first detection of harmine among the volatile organic compounds. Through network pharmacology and protein interaction analysis, the compounds' potential therapeutic targets of the compounds were explored, and 23 key targets were obtained (AKT1, ALB, PTGS2, MAOA, etc). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated significant involvement in neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions and serotonergic synapses. The results enhanced the understanding of P. harmala's pharmacological mechanisms and supported its ethnopharmacological use."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
