The purpose of this study was to develop a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method for serum RTS determination in mice. Serum samples were deproteinated by acetonitrile, separated on a C<sub>18</sub> -PFP column and delivered at 0.8\u00a0ml/min with an eluting system composed of water containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid as mobile phases. RTS and the internal standard S-hexylglutathione (H-GSH) were quantitatively monitored with precursor-to-product transitions of m/z 352.1\u2009\u2192\u2009120.1 and m/z 392.2\u2009\u2192\u2009246.3, respectively. The method showed excellent linearity over the concentration range 0.05-50\u2009\u03bcg/ml, with correlation coefficient r<sup>2</sup> \u2009=\u20090.9992. The extraction recovery was >86.34%, and the matrix effect was not significant. Inter- and intra-day precisions (RSD) were <4.99%. The validated LC-MS/MS method was successfully applied to study the toxicokinetic profiles of serum RTS in mice after intravenous, oral administration and co-treated with ketoconazole, which showed that RTS displayed a long half-life (~11.05\u2009h) and good bioavailability (81.80%). Co-administration of ketoconazole (KTZ) increased the peak serum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve and decreased the clearance and mean residence time. Summing up, a new standardized method was established for quantitative determination of RTS in sera."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Pharmacy and State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Miao's Medicines and Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM, Ministry of Education and Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Pharmacy and State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Miao's Medicines and Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM, Ministry of Education and Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Mengyue", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Pharmacy and State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Miao's Medicines and Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM, Ministry of Education and Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Xiaoqiong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Pharmacy and State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Miao's Medicines and Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM, Ministry of Education and Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Pharmacy and State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Miao's Medicines and Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM, Ministry of Education and Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Pharmacy and State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Miao's Medicines and Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM, Ministry of Education and Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Kunna", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Miao's Medicines and Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM, Ministry of Education and Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Weiwei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8187-2147"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Pharmacy and State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Miao's Medicines and Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM, Ministry of Education and Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, P.
