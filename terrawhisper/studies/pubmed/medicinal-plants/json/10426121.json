Fermentation was monitored by pH, texture, amino-nitrogen content and the viable cell count of the substrate. The 40 degrees C, 98% RH or the 130 microm high density polyethylene (HDPE) treatment increased the fermentation microflora from ca. 10(6) CFU/g to ca. 10(8) CFU/g with high initial changes in pH (5.8-ca. 7.9) and texture (2.0 kg/cm2 to between 1.4 kg/cm2 and 0.9 kg/cm2) in 24 hours. Products with amino-nitrogen contents of between 12.00 mg N/100 g dry matter and 14.00 mg N/100 g dry matter were obtained in 3 days. The cell count of the 30 degrees C, 80% RH or 70 microm treatment increased from 10(6) CFU/g to ca. 10(7) CFU/g and the pH increased from 5.8 to about 6.7 with a coincident decrease in the texture value from 2.0 kg/cm2 to about 1.7 kg/cm2 in 24 hours. Products with amino-nitrogen contents between 15.00 mg N/100 g dry matter and 19.2 mg N/100 g dry matter were obtained after 3 days. Changes in the fermentation indicators were not significant at p < or = 0.05 (pH and texture) and at p < or = 0.01 (amino-nitrogen) after 3 days for the 25 degrees C, 59.9% RH or 50 microm low density polyethylene (LDPE) treatment. Products of fermentation at the combined optimal conditions (80% RH, 35 degrees C, and 70 microm HDPE) compared very well with the traditionally fermented products in terms of pH, texture and amino-nitrogen content."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, Abia State University, Uturu, Nigeria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Isu", "ForeName": "N R", "Initials": "NR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Njoku", "ForeName": "H O", "Initials": "HO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Int J Food Microbiol. 1989 May;8(2):133-9", "ArticleIdList": ["2641887"]}, {"Citation": "J Sci Food Agric. 1973 Dec;24(12):1505-14", "ArticleIdList": ["4801140"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10426121", "10.1023/a:1008042726487"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
