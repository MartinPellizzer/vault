During the clinical use of TOL, adverse events such as liver injury took place. The present study aimed at the investigation of the metabolic activation of TOL possibly associated with its hepatotoxicity. One GSH conjugate, two NAC conjugates, and two cysteine conjugates were found in both mouse and human liver microsomal incubations supplemented with TOL, GSH/NAC/cysteine, and NADPH. The detected conjugates suggest the production of a quinone methide intermediate. The same GSH conjugate was also observed in mouse primary hepatocytes and in the bile of rats receiving TOL. One of the urinary NAC conjugates was observed in rats administered TOL. One of the cysteine conjugates was found in a digestion mixture containing hepatic proteins from animals administered TOL. The observed protein modification was dose-dependent. CYP3A primarily catalyzes the metabolic activation of TOL. Ketoconazole (KTC) pretreatment reduced the generation of the GSH conjugate in mouse liver and cultured primary hepatocytes after TOL treatment. In addition, KTC reduced the susceptibility of primary hepatocytes to TOL cytotoxicity. The quinone methide metabolite may be involved in TOL-induced hepatotoxicity and cytotoxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110016, P.
