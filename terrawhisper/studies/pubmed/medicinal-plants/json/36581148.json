The current treatments are limited due to their toxicity and treatment failures, which have increased the search for new substances of natural origin to control this infection. Capparis spinosa is an important medicinal plant, rich in biochemical compounds with a broad range of activities including antimicrobial effects. Nevertheless, more investigations are still needed to determine its effect on Leishmania parasites. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of C. spinosa' extracts on Leishmania major promastigotes and amastigotes growth as well as on L-arginine metabolic pathways, especially the production of leishmanicidal molecules such as nitric oxide. Our results showed that C. spinosa' methanolic and aqueous extracts contained polyphenols and flavonoids at different concentrations. The methanolic extract of C. spinosa, compared to the aqueous extract, showed significantly higher amounts of total polyphenols (21.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.08) mg GAE/g of dw (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), as well as a higher antioxidant activity evaluated respectively by Reducing Power and DPPH (EC<sub>50</sub>: 0.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 and 7.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.28) mg/ml. Both extracts significantly inhibited L. major promastigotes and intra-macrophagic amastigotes growth in vitro in a dose-dependent manner (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and induced NO production not only in Leishmania-infected macrophages but also in uninfected macrophages, without showing any cytotoxicity in vitro. Furthermore, in silico docking studies showed that C. spinosa compounds identified by RP-HPLC exhibited inhibitory activity against the arginase enzyme. The leishmanicidal effect of C. spinosa may be due to its phenolic content and its mechanism of action may be mediated by an increase in NO production and by the inhibition of arginase enzyme in silico. These findings support the hypothesis that C. spinosa might be a valuable source of new biomolecules for leishmaniasis treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
