Our goal was to evaluate the impact of a single 40 mg kg-1 dose of praziquantel on anaemia. Since praziquantel does not reduce the hookworm intensity of infection (a major cause of anaemia in children in the area) changes in the prevalence of anaemia in the study population should be due only to the elimination of S. haematobium. Seven hundred and seventy-one primary schoolboys from Bertoua (East Cameroon) were divided into four groups: high infection, moderate infection treated with praziquantel or placebo, and non-infected. Haemoglobin concentrations of the children were determined at the onset of the study and 6 months after the praziquantel intervention. Mean haemoglobin concentrations were not significantly different for no infection or for mild or heavy infection by S. haematobium. A factorial analysis of variance using S. haematobium intensity of infection, malaria and intestinal parasite infections and age as independent variables and haemoglobin concentration as the dependent variable show that only age and malaria infection show a significant relationship with haemoglobin concentration. Despite treatment with praziquantel, all the children in the treatment groups had lower mean haemoglobins 6 months after intervention. A factorial analysis of variance using age, malaria infection and the treatment category as independent variables and the difference in haemoglobin concentration as the dependent variable shows that only malaria infection showed a significant relationship with haemoglobin concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Research and Study of Medicinal Plants (IMPM), Yaounde, Republic of Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Befidi-Mengue", "ForeName": "R N", "Initials": "RN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ratard", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Beltran", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "D'Alessandro", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rice", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Befidi-Mengue", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kouemeni", "ForeName": "L E", "Initials": "LE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cline", "ForeName": "B L", "Initials": "BL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Trop Med Hyg", "NlmUniqueID": "0406044", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5304"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemoglobins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6490C9U457", "NameOfSubstance": "Praziquantel"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Anemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cameroon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hemoglobins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "complications"], "DescriptorName": "Malaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Praziquantel"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "complications", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Schistosomiasis haematobia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8345542"]}}]}
