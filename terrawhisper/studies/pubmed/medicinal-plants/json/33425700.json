They are sources of phytochemicals that applications for esthetic and healthcare. The aim of this research was to examine the phytochemical constituents and anti-aging potential of these plants. The phytochemical compounds were performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The anti-aging activities were evaluated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sunfonic acid) (ABTS), anti-collagenase, and anti-elastase assays. The main interest phytochemical compounds of ethanolic extracts of <i>C. asiatica</i>, <i>N. nucifera</i>, <i>H. sabdariffa</i> were ethanol, 2-(-Octadecenyloxy), \u03b3-sitosterol and hexadecanoic acid, and ethyl ester, respectively. The DPPH half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) results of <i>C. asiatica</i>, <i>N. nucifera, and H. sabdariffa</i> were 0.32 \u00b1 0.01, 0.34 \u00b1 0.00, and 0.35 \u00b1 0.01 mg/mL, respectively. The ABTS result of <i>H. sabdariffa</i> extract showed high inhibitory activity at IC<sub>50</sub> of the extract was 0.62 \u00b1 0.12 mg/mL. The percentage of collagenase inhibition of <i>C. asiatica</i>, <i>N. nucifera</i>, and <i>H. sabdariffa</i> at 1.0 mg/mL was 78.13 \u00b1 4.42, 85.94 \u00b1 2.21, and 90.63 \u00b1 0.00, respectively. The <i>C. asiatica</i> extract had a high percentage of elastase inhibition. Consequently, these research results suggest that phytochemicals may also provide a range of esthetic and health benefits. The phytochemical constituent could be used as anti-aging active ingredient for cosmetic and pharmaceutical industrials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2020 Journal of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology & Research."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health and Aesthetics, Thai Traditional Medicine College, Rajamangala University of Technology Thanyaburi, Pathum Thani, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Khuanekkaphan", "ForeName": "Monsicha", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Innovation of Health Products, Thai Traditional Medicine College, Rajamangala University of Technology Thanyaburi, Pathum Thani, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Noysang", "ForeName": "Chanai", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Thai Traditional Medicine, Thai Traditional Medicine College, Rajamangala University of Technology Thanyaburi, Pathum Thani, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Khobjai", "ForeName": "Warachate", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Adv Pharm Technol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101537797", "ISSNLinking": "0976-2094"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "National Science and Technology Development Agency: NSTDA Thailand.
