Nonetheless, common osteoarthritis treatments are either not effective or associated with side effects. Now the materials derived from plants have found a relevant place in drug discovery. Until the mid-18th century, osteoarthritis in all medical schools worldwide had been managed as general arthritis. Avicenna, the famous scholar of Iranian traditional medicine has provided a long list of herbs that have been used traditionally to treat arthritis. To gain this worthy list, we searched his most famous medical masterpiece: Canon of Medicine Some of these materials are investigated and employed by modern medicine. However, it is difficult to ignore that still more of these naturally occurring materials could be of use in modern medicine not only to prevent osteoarthritis progression but also osteoarthritis management as natural anti-inflammatory drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2015."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Medicine, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Choopani", "ForeName": "Rasool", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Medicine, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran anahitaghourchian@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Ghourchian", "ForeName": "Anahita", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Pharmacy, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran Materia and Medica Research Center, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hajimehdipoor", "ForeName": "Homa", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Kamalinejad", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Evid Based Complementary Altern Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101556804", "ISSNLinking": "2156-5899"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoarthritis"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26311572", "10.1177/2156587215599291", "2156587215599291"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
