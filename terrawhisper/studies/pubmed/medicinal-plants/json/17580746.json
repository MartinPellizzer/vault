The differentiation between Rhizoma Atractylodes and Rhizoma Atractylodes macrocephalae was found in the clinical practice of the Han Dynasty. The original drug of both and the genuine sites of production were formed in the Song Dynasty when the latter was readily differentiated into various commodities, while most modern commodities were combined as Rhizoma Atractylodes macrocephalae. On the contrary, there was only a single commodity of Rhizoma Atractylodes in ancient times. It was not until the modern times that this drug was differentiated into multiple commodities.
