The plasma scutellarin concentration-time curve was fitted to the open two-compartment model. In the plasma samples, the main metabolites were deduced as 4',5-dihydroxyflavonon-7-O-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl ester (M1), scutellarin (M2), 7-methoxy-4',5-dihydroxy-flavonon (M3) and 7-methoxy4,5,6-dihydroxyflavonon (M4).", "The pharmacokinetic parameters of scutellarin were significantly different in normal and model rats.
