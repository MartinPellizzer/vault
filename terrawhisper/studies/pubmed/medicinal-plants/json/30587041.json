Treatments include the use of oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These drugs have several side effects. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review on the transdermal administration of drugs and the use of alternative therapies for the treatment of PD.", "The article bases were Web of Science, PubMed and Sciencedirect and the patent bases were INPI, EPO and WIPO with publications on Primary Dysmenorrhea and associations with Transdermal Administration; Complementary Therapies and Medicinal Plants. 21 articles and 12 patents were analyzed. The results demonstrate the need for alternative therapies for the treatment of PD, with greater effectiveness and lower side effects, mainly in an attempt to reduce the intensity and duration of pain as well as reducing the continuous use of medications.", "The study of technological prospection highlighted the relevant importance in seeking new methods for the relief of the symptoms provoked by this condition. The perspectives coexist in the discovery of new natural and biotechnological pharmacological applications, mainly in the development of new devices capable of facilitating and optimizing this form of administration in an attempt to reduce side effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Postgraduate Program in Biotechnology - RENORBIO , Focal Point - Federal University of Piau\u00ed , Teresina , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Dias", "ForeName": "S\u00e1via Francisca Lopes", "Initials": "SFL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Pharmacy , Federal University of Piau\u00ed , Teresina , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Pereira", "ForeName": "Layane Carneiro Alves", "Initials": "LCA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Medicinal Plants Research Center , Federal University of Piaui , Teresina , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Oliveira", "ForeName": "Aldeidia Pereira de", "Initials": "AP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Medicinal Plants Research Center , Federal University of Piaui , Teresina , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Santos", "ForeName": "Rosimeire Ferreira Dos", "Initials": "RFD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Postgraduate Program in Biotechnology - RENORBIO , Focal Point - Federal University of Piau\u00ed , Teresina , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Nunes", "ForeName": "L\u00edvio C\u00e9sar Cunha", "Initials": "LCC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Expert Opin Ther Pat", "NlmUniqueID": "9516419", "ISSNLinking": "1354-3776"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Cutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dysmenorrhea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patents as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30587041", "10.1080/13543776.2019.1562547"]}}]}
