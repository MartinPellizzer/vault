Iridium catalysts containing new chiral NN ligands and achiral phosphines were effective for the asymmetric hydrogenation of heteroaromatic ketones, which afforded corresponding alcohols in up to 99.9% ee. The same protocol was applicable to the asymmetric hydrogenation of \u03b1-chloroheteroaryl ketones. Most importantly, the gram-scale asymmetric hydrogenation of 2-acetylthiophene and 2-acetylfuran proceeded smoothly even under 1 MPa of H<sub>2</sub>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants and School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants and School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants and School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants and School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants and School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants and School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Pinli", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants and School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Linlin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2608-8587"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants and School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4890-109X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants and School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chun", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Org Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985193R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3263"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "35"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37226800", "10.1021/acs.joc.3c00786"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
