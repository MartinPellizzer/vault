In the present work, a series of ROR\u03b3t agonists were investigated by a molecular modeling study combining three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship (3D-QSAR), molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding free energies to get insight into the molecular features that would promote binding activity. The optimum comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) models for 3D-QSAR studies possess satisfactory predictive ability, with R<sup>2</sup><sub>cv</sub>=0.615, R<sup>2</sup><sub>pred</sub>=0.8702 for CoMFA, and R<sup>2</sup><sub>cv</sub>=0.670, R<sup>2</sup><sub>pred</sub>=0.7683 for CoMSIA model, respectively. In addition, molecular docking studies, molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energies were used to find the actual conformations of compounds in the active site of ROR\u03b3t, and key residues GLN-286, LEU-287, HIS-323 and ARG-367 for higher binding activity were pointed out. The predicted models will help us to understand the structural requirements of ROR\u03b3t agonists for the designing of better active compounds. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
