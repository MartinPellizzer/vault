(Melastamataceae family) is a small evergreen tree reported as having ethnobotanical and pharmacological properties. The present study was aimed to investigate the spectral characterization and antibacterial activity of isolated pure compound (3\u03b2-hydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid (ursolic acid)) from Memecylon edule leaves by performing bioassay guided isolation method. The structure derivation of isolated compound was done by different spectral studies like UV, FT-IR, LC-MS, CHNS analysis, 1D (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C and DEPT-135) and 2D-NMR (HSQC and HMBC), respectively. About 99.29% purity of the compound was found in LC analysis. <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum results of compound shown 48 protons appear at different shielded region and most of the protons were present in aliphatic region. Whereas, <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectral data resulted seven methyl carbons (CH3), nine methylene carbons (CH2), seven methine carbons (CH) and six non-hydrogenated carbons (C) which are characteristic of pentacyclic triterpene. The isolated pure compound was tested for its antibacterial properties against targeted human pathogens by performing agar well diffusion, MIC and MBC assays and the result exhibits better growth inhibitory effects against S. epidermidis and S. pneumoniae, with the MIC values of 1.56 and 3.15\u03bcg/ml. The outcome of this study suggests that the bioactive compound is used for development of plant based drugs in pharmaceutical industry for combating microbial mediated diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
