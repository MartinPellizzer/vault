Terminalia A., and Moringa oleifera (PF, TA, and MO) on arsenic trioxide (As2O3) induced alteration in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein contents was studied in vitro. Liver from healthy chicken (Gallus domesticus) weighing 1.2 to 1.5 kg was bought to laboratory in frozen condition from local slaughter house and used for study. When 0.2 mL of liver homogenate was treated with 1-5 microg/mL of As2O3, it caused significant alterations in LPO and total protein content of chicken liver. The maximum alteration was observed at 3 mg/mL concentration of As2O3. Addition of each plant extract to liver homogenate did not caused significant alteration in LPO and protein contents. However, concurrent addition of As2O3 and plant extract (25-100 microg/mL) caused significant ameliorative effect. Ameliorative effect of each plant extract was studied separately. The maximum amelioration of PF, MO, and TA was observed at 50 mg/mL, 100 microg/mL, and 100 microg/mL respectively. Thus it is concluded that aqueous extract of PF was observed to have better ameliorative effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University School of Science, Gujarat University, Ahmedabad 380 009, India. ramtejverma2000@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Ramtej", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trivedi", "ForeName": "Mrugesh", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keshwani", "ForeName": "Heena", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choksi", "ForeName": "Pooja", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sangai", "ForeName": "Neha", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pol Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "2985167R", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6837"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7V92P67HO", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenic Trioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arsenic Trioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arsenicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Euphorbiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Moringa oleifera"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18540161"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
