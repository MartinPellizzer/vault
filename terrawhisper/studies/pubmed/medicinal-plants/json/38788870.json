To discover bioactive molecules with potential anticancer properties, a homogeneous heteropolysaccharide (FOBP90-1) was purified from the medicinal macrofungus Fomitopsis officinalis. FOBP90-1 was found to have a molecular weight of 2.87\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>4</sup>\u00a0g/mol and mainly consist of \u21926)-\u03b1-d-Galp-(1\u2192, \u21922,6)-\u03b1-d-Galp-(1\u2192, \u21923)-\u03b1-l-Fucp-(1\u2192, \u21926)-\u03b2-d-Glcp-(1\u2192, \u03b1-d-Manp-(1\u2192, and 3-O-Me-\u03b1-l-Fucp-(1\u2192\u00a0according to UV, FT-IR, methylation analysis, and NMR data. In addition to its structural properties, FOBP90-1 displayed anticancer activity in zebrafish models. The following mechanistic analysis discovered that the in vivo antitumor effect was linked to immune activation and angiogenesis inhibition. These effects were mediated by the interactions of FOBP90-1 with TLR-2, TLR-4, PD-L1, and VEGFR-2, as determined through a series of experiments involving cells, transgenic zebrafish, molecular docking simulations, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). All the experimental findings have demonstrated that FOBP90-1, a purified fungal polysaccharide, is expected to be utilized as a cancer treatment agent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
