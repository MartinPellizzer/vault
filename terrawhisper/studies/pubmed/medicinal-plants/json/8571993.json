Most women had douched with water (19%) or water and soap (63%) at least once in the preceding month. Approximately 10% of the women had douched in the preceding month with a commercial agent (2%) or betel leaf (8%). Douching with water alone after sex was not associated with sexually transmitted disease. Douching with water and soap or with a betel leaf or commercial agent after sex was associated with sexually transmitted disease; adjusted odds ratios were 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.0 to 7.1) and 2.7 (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 14.5), respectively. The association was enhanced if the women douched before sex or both before and after sex; adjusted odds ratio were 2.7 (95% confidence interval 1.0 to 7.3) for douching with water and soap and 5.2 (95% confidence interval 1.6 to 16.7) for douching with betel leaf or a commercial agent. Compared with women who never douched, women who always douched with betel leaf or a commercial agent had a substantially increased risk for sexually transmitted disease (adjusted odds ratio 9.4, 95% confidence interval 1.8 to 50.3).", "We found a significant association between sexually transmitted disease and douching habits (douching with betel leaf, commercial agents, or water and soap).
