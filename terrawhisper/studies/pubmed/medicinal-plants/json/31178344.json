Jaundice is not a disease but it is a visible sign and symptom of liver disease which occurs when there is an increase in the amount of bilirubin circulating in the blood due to the abnormal metabolism and excretion in the urine. Medicinal plants are being used long ago by our ancestors for the treatment of jaundice. At the present era, consumption of these herbal medicines is increasing at a high speed, due to its less or no side effect and cost-effectiveness as compared to synthetic medicines. This review describes approximately 55 medicinal plants which are used by rural and tribal people of different area of Chhattisgarh for curing jaundice. The data was collected from different kinds of literature survey from the year 1993 to 2018. This review has been conferred in a systematic way which includes plant's vernacular name, botanical name along with its family, part used and ethnomedicinal uses in a tabulated form and also the description of scientific evidence behind the folklore uses of some medicinal plants along with their mechanism of action which have been reported in different kinds of literature.
