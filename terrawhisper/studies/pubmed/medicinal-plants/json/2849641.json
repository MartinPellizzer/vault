This morphologic transformation is discernible by light microscopy and can be visually quantitated. As described herein, dose-dependent astrocyte generation was demonstrated by treatment of confluent monolayers with forskolin [1], a compound known to activate adenylate cyclase, and the potency of four forskolin derivatives was found to correlate with previously established biologic potential. Neither a crude ginseng extract nor purified ginsenosides were active in the process, but supplementation of the otherwise inactive ginseng extract with 1 demonstrated 50% of the cells were morphologically converted to the astrocyte form at a concentration of approximately 0.0008%. Retinoic acid was also active in this test system; the morphologic transformation was reversed on treatment with colchicine, and intracellular cAMP concentration was elevated approximately 10-fold. Evaluation of 15 retinoids established a general correlation between the activity in this system and other systems reported in the literature. Thus, the astrocyte formation assay appears to provide several advantages that make it attractive as a screen for the detection or evaluation of substances capable of elevating intracellular cAMP concentration. In addition to technical ease, the procedure is rapid, sensitive, and relatively inexpensive."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Program for Collaborative Research in the Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois, Chicago 60612."}], "LastName": "Swanson", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "J X", "Initials": "JX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "De Souza", "ForeName": "N J", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pezzuto", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "KO4 CA00982", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P01 CA31827", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1F7A44V6OU", "NameOfSubstance": "Colforsin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5688UTC01R", "NameOfSubstance": "Tretinoin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E0399OZS9N", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclic AMP"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Astrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Colforsin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclic AMP"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glioma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methods"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tretinoin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2849641", "10.1021/np50059a019"]}}]}
