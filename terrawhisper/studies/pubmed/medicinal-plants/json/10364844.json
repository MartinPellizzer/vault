There are about 25 species and varieties of Fritillaria that carry the name Beimu on commercial markets. The price for each Beimu may differ by more than 100-fold. However, the identification of the origin of a particular species on the market is difficult. Here, a molecular method was used to identify various species of Fritillaria regardless of their geographical origin. The 5S-rRNA coding sequence is highly conserved in higher eukaryotes, but the spacer sequence of the 5S-rRNA gene is variable among different species. Total genomic DNA from fresh leaves and bulbs of Fritillaria cirrhosa, F. puqiensis, F. anhuiensis, and F. thunbergii was extracted. The 5S-rRNA spacer region of the extracted DNAs was amplified by PCR with a pair of primers located within the conserved coding region. The isolated cDNA clones (approximately 600 bp) covering the 5S-rRNA spacer domain were sequenced. By aligning the isolated nucleotide sequences of the four Fritillaria species, sequence diversity was found in the spacer region. Furthermore, a unique EcoR I site was used for the rapid identification of different species of Fritillaria. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the detection of 5S-rRNA spacer domain sequences of Fritillaria and their use to identify species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Biotechnology Research Institute, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Z H", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "T T", "Initials": "TT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsim", "ForeName": "K W", "Initials": "KW"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["AF199454", "AF199455", "AF199456", "AF199457"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 5S"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 5S"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10364844", "10.1055/s-1999-14003"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
