Graviresponsive roots of Z. mays are characterized by a strongly polar movement of 45Ca2+ across the root tip from the upper to the lower side. Horizontally-oriented roots of agt mutants exhibit only a minimal polar transport of 45Ca2+. Exogenously-induced asymmetries of Ca result in curvature of agt roots toward the Ca source. A similar curvature can be induced by a Ca asymmetry in normally nongraviresponsive (i.e., lateral) roots of Phaseolus vulgaris. Similarly, root curvature can be induced by placing the roots perpendicular to an electric field. This electrotropism increased with 1) currents between 8-35 mA, and 2) time between 1-9 hr when the current is constant. Electrotropism is reduced significantly by treating roots with triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA), an inhibitor of auxin transport. These results suggest that 1) if graviperception occurs via the sedimentation of amyloplasts in columella cells, then nongraviresponsive roots apparently sense gravity as do graviresponsive roots, 2) exogenously-induced asymmetries of a gravitropic effector (i.e., Ca) can induce curvature of normally nongraviresponsive roots, 3) the gravity-induced downward movement of exogenously-applied 45Ca2+ across tips of graviresponsive roots does not occur in nongraviresponsive roots, 4) placing roots in an electrical field (i.e., one favoring the movement of ions such as Ca2+) induces root curvature, and 5) electrically-induced curvature is apparently dependent on auxin transport. These results are discussed relative to a model to account for the lack of graviresponsiveness by these roots."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Baylor University, Waco, Texas 76798, USA."}], "LastName": "Moore", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fondren", "ForeName": "W M", "Initials": "WM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Marcum", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "0370467", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9122"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triiodobenzoic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H575A4059Q", "NameOfSubstance": "2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "GeneSymbolList": ["agt"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electricity"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gravitropism"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ions"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plastids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Triiodobenzoic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tropism"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11538256"]}}]}
