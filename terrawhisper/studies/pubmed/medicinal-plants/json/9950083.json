This study was therefore undertaken on cowpea leaves to determine the nutrient composition of fifteen varieties and the sensory attributes of ten varieties grown in Ghana. Nutritional components studied were moisture, protein, phosphorus and ascorbic acid. The sensory attributes included leaf size, taste and overall acceptability. There were significant (p > 0.05) differences among varieties in all nutrient components (fresh and dry weight basis), leaf size and overall acceptability. The nutrient composition values, on a dry weight basis, ranged from 9.4 to 13.0% for moisture, 303.8 to 468.9 mg/100 g for phosphorus, 33.5 to 148.0 mg/100 g for ascorbic acid, and 27.1 to 34.7% for protein. Differences in the sensory scores of leaves for taste were not significant (p > 0.05). Overall acceptability positively correlated with leaf size. Moisture content was negatively correlated with overall acceptability, phosphorus and ascorbic acid. Results can be exploited in a breeding program to develop nutritionally superior and acceptable cowpea varieties which can be used for harvesting of both leaves and seeds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Crops Research Institute (CSIR), Kumasi, Ghana."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahenkora", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adu Dapaah", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agyemang", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YLU75U4W", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphorus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9950083", "10.1023/a:1008019113245"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
