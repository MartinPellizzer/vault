Aflatoxins B1 and G1 were determined as their bromine derivatives, produced in an on-line post-column derivatization system. In SFB method, samples were ground and extracted with methanol-water (70:30). A portion of the extract was cleaned up by passage through a immunoaffinity column, One mL of purified extract was derivatized with a bromine reagent, and fluorescence of the solution was immediately quantified with a calibrated fluorometer containing a broad wavelength pulsed xenon light source.", "In IAC-HPLC method, the overall average recoveries for three different medicinal herbs spiked at levels of 1.3 and 2.6 ng x g(-1) of total aflatoxins ranged from 93% to 97%. The detection limit was 0. 06 microg x kg(-1) for both G2 and B2 and 0.20 microg x kg(-1) for both G1 and B1, based on a signal/noise 3:1 and the precision (within-laboratory relative standard deviation) ranged from 0.8% to 1.4%. Each of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2 in 39 kind medicinal materials were determined by IAC-PCD-HPLC, and the total aflatoxins were determined by SFB.", "The SFB method is not the suitable method for the determination of total aflatoxins in medicinal herbs and plant extracts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100094, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xue-hui", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jian-min", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1DB78J7PUD", "NameOfSubstance": "aflatoxin G1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9N2N2Y55MH", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxin B1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SBV4XY874G", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxin B1"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bromine"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Codonopsis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Prunus"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15813029"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
