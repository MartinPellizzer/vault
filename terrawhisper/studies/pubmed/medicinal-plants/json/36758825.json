The standard treatment for GBM is surgical interventions followed by temozolomide. We investigated for the first time, the cytotoxic impacts of Psidium guajava (P. guajava) on the U87 GBM cell line. We measured cell toxicity through the MTT test following 24\u00a0h, 48\u00a0h, and 72\u00a0h treatment with different concentrations of fruit and seed hydroalcoholic extracts of P. guajava (25-400\u00a0\u03bcg/ml). Lipid peroxidation assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and apoptosis rate were evaluated 24\u00a0h after treatment by extracts of P. guajava. Moreover, to determine the Bax/Bcl-2 and NF-\u03baB genes expression, we performed a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Our finding demonstrated that 50-400\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of P. guajava extracts dose-dependently decreased the viability of U87 cells. Also, treatment by extracts increased lipid peroxidation, ROS production, and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the RT-PCR demonstrated an up-regulation in Bax\\Bcl-2 and NF-\u03baB. Thus, P. guajava inhibited the proliferation of U87 GBM cells and increased apoptosis probably through Bax/Bcl-2 and NF-\u03baB regulation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
