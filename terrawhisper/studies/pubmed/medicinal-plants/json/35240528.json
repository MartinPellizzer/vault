This study evaluated the cardioprotective effects of the hydroalcoholic extract of Rheum turkestanicum on isoprenaline-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in Wistar rats.", "In this study, we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine the active compounds present in the extract. Thirty rats were divided to 5 groups (6 rats in each group). The extract was administered orally at the doses of 100 and 300\u00a0mg/kg body weight and then a subcutaneous injection of isoprenaline (85\u00a0mg/kg) was administered on the 8th and 9th days. Serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and creatinine kinase (CPK) were measured using standard commercial kits. Serum activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and cardiac levels of thiol and lipid peroxidation were also determined. Hematoxylin and eosin were used for histopathological staining.", "Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of 24 compounds in the hydro-ethanolic extract of R. turkestanicum. Isoprenaline increased malondialdehyde (4.002\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00178, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) while decreased thiol content (101.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.186, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Moreover, reduced activities of superoxide dismutase (139\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.88, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and catalase (2.812\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.215, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and elevated levels of LDH (1245\u00a0\u00b1\u00a062.28, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), CPK (898\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023.06, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and CK-MB (697\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050.22, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were observed. Pretreatment with the R. turkestanicum extract significantly reduced cardiac markers and increased thiol content as well as the activity of antioxidant enzymes. The extract attenuated the histopathological changes induced by isoprenaline.", "According to the obtained results, R. turkestanicum may be an appropriate candidate to reduce isoprenaline-induced MI through modulation of oxidative stress. Administration of the extract attenuated cardiac enzymes following isoprenaline administration. The cardioprotective action of the extract can be attributed to the bioactive antioxidant ingredients of R. turkestanicum. To identify the precise mechanisms, further investigations are required."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..
