Medicinal plants, on the other hand, may serve as an alternate source of anti-diabetic drugs. A polyherbal combination has a higher and more extensive therapeutic potential than a single herb. Yet, due to deterioration during the absorption process, the usage of this drug still yields inadequate results. Encapsulation of polyherbal drug with chitosan nanoparticles is one of the key ways to solve this problem due to its biocombatibilty, slow and targeted drug delivery characteristics. In the present study, the chitosan was derived from prawn shell and the chitosan nanoparticles had been prepared by ionic-gelation method. The anti-diabetic polyherbal drug (Andrographis paniculata, Andrographis alata, Adhatoda zeylanica, Gymnema sylvestre, Syzygium cumini, and Justicia glabra) was encapsulated with a bio-derived chitosan biopolymer. The drug loading efficiency was about 85\u00a0%. The chemical and physical properties of the chitosan and drug-loaded chitosan nanoparticles had been analyzed by FT-IR absorption, XRD, SEM, TEM and EDAX analysis. The antidiabetic efficiency, hepatoprotective activity and antihyperlipedimic activity of the chitosan nanoparticles, polyherbal drug and polyherbal drug encapsulated with chitosan nanoparticles were assessed in a group of rats. The polyherbal drug reduced the serum glucose level from 306.4\u00a0mg/dL to 134.47\u00a0mg/dL, while the polyherbal drug encapsulated with chitosan nanoparticles reduced to 127.017\u00a0mg/dL. This was very close to the serum glucose level of non-diabetic rat (124.65\u00a0mg/dL). Further, it considerably increased the insulin level close to that of non-diabetic rat. Thus, the polyherbal drug encapsulated with chitosan nanoparticles showed superior efficiency in antidiabetic and also diabetic complications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
