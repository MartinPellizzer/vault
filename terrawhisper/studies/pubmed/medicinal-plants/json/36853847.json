Cerebrolysin (CBL), consists of low molecular weights neurotrophic factors and amino acids obtained from purified porcine brain proteins. This study aimed to evaluate the possible therapeutic effects of enriched environment (EE) and CBL alone or combined for reducing anxiety and cognitive deficits in PTSD-like mouse models. For this purpose, inescapable electric foot shocks were delivered to Balb/c mice for two consecutive days. Then mice were treated with CBL (2.5\u2009mL/kg) and/or were kept in EE (2\u2009h per day) or received their combination for 14 consecutive days. The hole-board test and Lashley III paradigm were used to assess anxiety and spatial learning and memory, respectively. Changes in the serum corticosterone level and expression of synaptic elements, including; growth-associated protein 43, post-synaptic density 95, and synaptophysin were assessed in the hippocampus. This model caused anxiety and spatial memory impairment associated with increased serum corticosterone levels and decreased synaptic elements. Nevertheless, CBL and/or combination treatment could reverse behavioral and molecular alterations. Our findings indicated that CBL, separately or in combination with EE, is effective in reducing anxiety and spatial memory impairment in PTSD-like mice."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.
