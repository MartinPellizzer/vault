The current study is based on the biochemical and molecular level identification of the novel cold-adapted yeast Rhodotorula mucilaginosa sp. GUMS16. Possible antioxidant and antiproliferative activities, as well as extraction and characterization of the GUMS16-produced EPS, were assessed during the course of this study. The results indicated that the strain of GUMS16 is a cold-adapted yeast with growth capability at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and an approximate EPS production yield of 28.5\u00a0g/L which are characterized as highly branched beta-D-glucan having glucose and mannose residues (85:15\u00a0mol%, respectively) with an average molecular weight of 84\u00a0kDa. In comparison to hyaluronic acid, DPPH, and OH, the scavenging activity attributed to the GUMS16-produced EPS was higher alongside being dose-dependent. The biocompatibility profile of the EPS was well-recognized based on its zero-cytotoxicity rate on a normal cell model. Collectively, the favorable properties of the EPS accentuate their potential as biocompatible compound suitable for subsequent pharmaceutical and industrial applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
