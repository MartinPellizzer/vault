Several medicinal plants in Brazil have received names of medicines and brand-name products.", "The present work aimed to evaluate the chemical composition and pharmacological activity in the central nervous system of three species known popularly by brand names of analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, and digestive drugs.", "Hydroethanolic extracts of Alternanthera dentata (AD), Ocimum carnosum (OC), and Plectranthus barbatus (PB) aerial parts were submitted to phytochemical analysis by HPLC-PAD-ESI-MS/MS and evaluated in animal models at doses of 500 and 1000\u00a0mg/kg. Mice were tested on hot plate, acetic acid-induced writing, formalin-induced licking, and intestinal transit tests. Aspirin and morphine were employed as standard drugs.", "The three extracts did not change the mice's response on the hot plate. Hydroethanolic extracts of AD and PB reduced the number of writhes and licking time, while OC was only effective on the licking test at dose of 1000\u00a0mg/kg. In addition, AD and OC reduced intestinal transit, while PB increased gut motility.", "Pharmacological tests supported some popular uses, suggesting peripheral antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects, while the phytochemical analysis showed the presence of several flavonoids in the three hydroethanolic extracts and steroids in PB, with some barbatusterol derivatives described for the first time in the species."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
