Effective treatment of diabetes is increasingly dependent on active constituents of medicinal plants capable of controlling hyperglycemia as well as its secondary complications. Viscum schimperi Engl. is a plant growing in Saudi Arabia and known for its antidiabetic activity. The potential antidiabetic activity of its methanol extract as well as its chloroform, n-butanol, and the remaining water fractions was evaluated in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats at two dose levels. The antidiabetic activity was assessed through the determination of fasting blood glucose level, insulin levels, area under the curve (AUC) in oral glucose tolerance test, glucose absorption in isolated rat gut assay, and glucose uptake by psoas muscle. Moreover, large-scale untargeted metabolite profiling of methanol extract was performed via UPLC-PDA and qTOF-MS (ultra-performance liquid chromatography photodiode array detection and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry) respectively, to explore its chemical composition and standardization of its extract. Multivariate statistical analysis including principal component analysis and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis was used to determine bioactives in its fractions. In conclusion, oleanane triterpenes and O-caffeoyl quinic acid conjugates were the major compounds that might account for antihyperglycemic effect of the plant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Products, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, 21589, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, 11562, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abdallah", "ForeName": "Hossam M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, 11562, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Farag", "ForeName": "Mohamed A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, 21589, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Abdel-Naim", "ForeName": "Ashraf B", "Initials": "AB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, 21589, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ghareib", "ForeName": "Salah A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Products, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, 21589, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, 11562, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abdel-Sattar", "ForeName": "Essam A", "Initials": "EA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8PJ61P6TS3", "NameOfSubstance": "1-Butanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "1-Butanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucose Tolerance Test"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saudi Arabia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viscaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viscum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26236010", "10.1002/ptr.5424"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
