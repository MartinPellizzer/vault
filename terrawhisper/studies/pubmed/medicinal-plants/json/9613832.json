The clear soluble extract was dried and found to be 0.238 g/g dry roots. A gastric ulcer was induced in fastened animals by oral ingestion of ethanol. Administration of 0.080 g of ASRE prior to ethanol ingestion protected the stomach of the rat from ulcer formation. The ulcer index values, expressed as a percentage of total stomach surface area affected by the ulcer, were lowered from 34.0+/-4.0 to 6.0+/-0.7 and 32.5+/-9.4 to 2.2+/-1.4 by the morphometric and the planimetric methods, respectively. Treatment of the induced ulcer in guinea pigs was achieved by oral administration of ASRE at the therapeutic dose of extract of 0.286 g/kg body weight/day for 24 days. The intraperitoneal LD50 of ASRE in mice was 0.080 g extract/kg body weight. Replacing water intake by ASRE at 75 ml of variable extract concentrations of 2.865, 3.57 and 4.284 g/l per animal per day for 90 days showed no histopathological changes in all organs of the rat. However, a clear depression effect on the central nervous system and anemia were observed particularly with extract of 3.57 g/l or more."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Jordan, Amman."}], "LastName": "Disi", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tamimi", "ForeName": "S O", "Initials": "SO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abuereish", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Anemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intraperitoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Jordan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lethal Dose 50"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9613832", "10.1016/s0378-8741(97)00134-7", "S0378874197001347"]}}]}
