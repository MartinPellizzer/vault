Although recent biotransformation research have used plant cell cultures to target a wide range of bioactive compounds, more compiled information and synopses are needed to better understand metabolic pathways and improve biotransformation efficiencies.", "This report reviews the biochemical transformation of phenolic natural products by plant cell cultures in order to identify potential novel biotechnological approaches for ensuring more homogeneous and stable phenolic production year-round under controlled environmental conditions.", "Articles on the use of plant cell culture for polyphenolic and flavonoid transformations (1988 - 2021) were retrieved from SciFinder, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science through electronic and manual search in English. Following that, the authors chose the required papers based on the criteria they defined. The following keywords were used for the online search: biotransformation, Plant cell cultures, flavonoids, phenolics, and pharmaceutical products.", "The initial search found a total of 96 articles. However, only 70 of them were selected as they met the inclusion criteria defined by the authors. The analysis of these studies revealed that plant tissue culture is applicable for the large-scale production of plant secondary metabolites including the phenolics, which have high therapeutic value.", "Plant tissue cultures could be employed as an efficient technique for producing secondary metabolites including phenolics. Phenolics possess a wide range of therapeutic benefits, as anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory properties. Callus culture, suspension cultures, transformation, and other procedures have been used to improve the synthesis of phenolics. Their production on a large scale is now achievable. More breakthroughs will lead to newer insights and, without a doubt, to a new era of phenolics-based pharmacological agents for the treatment of a variety of infectious and degenerative disorders."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier GmbH.
