Herein, novel nanocomposites were prepared based on layered double hydroxides (LDH NPs), Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>nanoparticles (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>NPs), and chitosan hydrogel beads in different concentrations. The characteristics and composition of the prepared materials were investigated by various techniques such as XRD, FESEM, and FTIR. The results indicate that the nanocomposites are synthesized successfully, and each component is present in hydrogel matrixes. Then, their biomedical properties, including antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant activity, were examined. Our findings demonstrate that the antimicrobial activity of nanocomposites significantly depends on the concentration of each component and their chemical groups. It shows itself in the result of the inhibitory zone of all bacteria or fungi samples. The obtained results indicate that the nanocomposite of Chitosan-hydrogel beads with 20% LDH and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(CHB-LDH-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>%20) and Chitosan-hydrogel beads based on 20% LDH (CHB-LDH%20) showed excellent antibacterial and antifungal properties against all tested bacteria and fungi (<i>P</i>\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01). In addition, the antioxidant effects of the synthesized materials (especially CHB-LDH Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>%20 and CHB-LDH%20) were investigated, showing high antioxidant efficacy against DPPH free radicals (<i>P</i>\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01). According to our findings, we can say that these materials are promising biomaterials for inhibiting some infectious bacteria and fungi."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Gholami", "ForeName": "Milad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbasi", "ForeName": "Naser", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4536-6041"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaneialvar", "ForeName": "Hori", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Karimi", "ForeName": "Elahe", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5175-6428"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chemistry, Shahrood University of Technology, Shahrood, Iran."}], "LastName": "Afzalinia", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zangeneh", "ForeName": "Mohammad Mahdi", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Laboratory of Dendrimers and Nanopolymers, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yadollahi", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanotechnology", "NlmUniqueID": "101241272", "ISSNLinking": "0957-4484"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biocompatible Materials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9012-76-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Chitosan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biocompatible Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chitosan"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogels"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Phenomena"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36125420", "10.1088/1361-6528/ac88da"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
