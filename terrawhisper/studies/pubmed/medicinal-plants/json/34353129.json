The medicinal part of A. dahurica is its root, and mainly function for treat cold, headache, toothache, rhinitis, diabetes, etc. Besides, A. dahurica is also used as a spice in Asia. In September 2018, brown spot was observed on the leaves of A. dahurica in fields of Anguo City, Hebei Province, China. In the field investigated, the incidence of brown spot disease reached 15%. The infected leaves showed brown spots surrounded with pale yellow edge, resulting in withered of the whole leaf. It seriously endangers the growth of A. dahurica, reducing the yield and quality of medicinal materials, even leading to the death of plants. We isolated the pathogen from 10 leaves with same lesions, the small square leaf pieces of approximately 3 to 5 mm were obtained with the sterile scissors from the junction of infected and healthy tissues, sterilized with sodium hypochlorite (10%) for 1 min followed by washing in sterile water for 3 times, then incubated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates at 25\u00b0C for 4 days. The culture was transferred to new PDA plates and was cultivated in dark at 25\u00b0C for 10 days. A total of 3 species of fungi were isolated, and only one fungus species has been found to be able to cause the original pathological characteristics of A. dahurica leaves through the back-grafting experiment. The mycelium was black and began to sporulate after 8 days on PDA media by single spore separation. Multiple spores joined together to form spores chain. The spores were spindle-shaped, yellow to yellow brown, and size ranged from 45 to 55 \u00d7 15 to 20 \u00b5m (n=50), with zero to three longitudinal septa and one to five transverse septa. For pathogenicity tests, the spore suspension (3.5\u00d7105 spores/mL) were inoculated to healthy plants grown in experimental field, the test was repeated four times, and 10 leaves were inoculated in each repetition, and the sterile water was inoculated as the blank control. Inoculated leaves were covered with transparent plastic bags for 24 h to keep humidity. Nine days later, it was found that there were lesions on the leaves inoculated with the pathogen, and the traits were the same as those in the field, while the controls are healthy. The fungus was consistently isolated from the inoculated leaves. The similar isolates were re-isolated from the inoculated and infected leaves and identified as Alternaria tenuissima by DNA sequencing, fulfilling Koch's postulates. Fungal genomic DNA was extracted from 7-day-old culture. PCR amplifications were performed using primers ITS1 / ITS4 and TEFF / TEFR respectively (Takahashi et al. 2006, Du 2008). The nucleotide sequence of PCR products, which have been deposited in Genebank under the accession numbers MN153514 and MN735428, showed 99.8%-100% identity with the corresponding sequences of A. tenuissima (MW194297 and MK415954). In order to further identify the pathogen species, we constructed a phylogenetic tree by combining TEF sequence and ITS sequence to distinguish the relationship between the pathogen and other minor species in the genus Alternaria, the isolate was clustered in the Alternaria clade. Therefore, the pathogen was identified as A. tenuissima based on the morphological characteristics and molecular identification. To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. tenuissima causing leaf spot on A. dahurica in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei Agricultural University, 74562, College of Plant Protection, Baoding, Hebei, China; hanshipeng1994@163.com."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Shipeng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei Agriculture University, College of Life Sciences, 2596 Lekai South Street, Lianchi District, Baoding City, Hebei Province, Baoding, China, 071000."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China; wangqing9525@126.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei Agricultural University, 74562, College of Plant Protection, Baoding, Hebei, China; 375868200@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shuo", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BaoDing, China; Jinxi2007@126.com."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Xi", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mycotoxin and Molecular Plant Pathology, Laboratory,, Agricultural University of Hebei, baoding, hebei, China; haozhimin@hebau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Zhi Min", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural University of Hebei, College of Plant Protection, Lekai South Street, BaoDing, Hebei, China, 071000; heyz63@sina.com."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Yunzhuan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "28"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["34353129", "10.1094/PDIS-06-21-1240-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
