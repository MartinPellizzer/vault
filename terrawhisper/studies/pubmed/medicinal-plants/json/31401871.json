(Myrtaceae). The hydrodistilled essential oil of the leaves was analysed by GC-FID and GC-MS. The antimicrobial activity of the oil was assessed against human and plant pathogenic microorganisms by disc diffusion, microdilution broth and poison food techniques. A total of forty-six constituents, representing 90.9% of the total oil composition were identified. Major constituents of the oil were limonene (29.1%), (<i>E</i>)-caryophyllene (15.7%), caryophyllene oxide (8.8%), caryophylla-4(12),8(13)-dien-5-ol (6.5%), (<i>E</i>)-nerolidol (4.0%), <i>\u03b1</i>-cadinol (3.4%), and muurola-4,10(14)-dien-1-<i>\u03b2</i>-ol (2.5%). The chemical composition of the examined essential oil was quite different from those reported earlier. The essential oil showed significant inhibition of human pathogenic bacteria (MIC: 0.065-0.261\u2009mg/mL) and plant pathogenic fungi, namely <i>Curvularia lunata</i> (86.02%) and <i>Fusarium chlamydosporum</i> (82.80%)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, P.O.
