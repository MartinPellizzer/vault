The bond dissociation energy of O-H bond (BDE) was calculated by semi-empirical quantum chemical methods. As a new parameter for QSAR models, sum of reciprocals of BDE of enol and phenol groups (X <sub>BDE</sub> ) was calculated. Significant correlations were observed between X <sub>BDE</sub> and antioxidant activities, and X <sub>BDE</sub> was introduced as a parameter for developing QSAR models. Linear regression-applied QSAR models and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-applied QSAR models were developed. QSAR models by both of linear regression and ANFIS achieved high prediction accuracies. Among the developed models, ANFIS-applied models achieved better prediction accuracies than linear regression-applied models. From these results, the proposed parameter of X <sub>BDE</sub> was confirmed as an appropriate variable for predicting and analysing antioxidant activities of phenolic compounds. Also, the ANFIS could be applied on QSAR models to improve prediction accuracy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Convergence Research Center for Smart Farm Solution, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Gangneung Institute of Natural Products, Gangneung, Gangwon-do, 25451, Korea."}], "LastName": "Jhin", "ForeName": "Changho", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Convergence Research Center for Smart Farm Solution, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Gangneung Institute of Natural Products, Gangneung, Gangwon-do, 25451, Korea."}], "LastName": "Nho", "ForeName": "Chu Won", "Initials": "CW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Nutrition, and Research Institute of Human Ecology, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Korea. keum@snu.ac.kr."}], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Keum Taek", "Initials": "KT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Arch Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8000036", "ISSNLinking": "0253-6269"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzothiazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfonic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "28752-68-3", "NameOfSubstance": "2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzothiazoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Predictive Value of Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfonic Acids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28801892", "10.1007/s12272-017-0944-8", "10.1007/s12272-017-0944-8"]}}]}
