Both drugs are hydrophilic and are difficult to be purified by conventional purification methods of natural products. A high-performance displacement chromatography (HPDC) method successfully purified palmatine and its semi-synthetic derivative dl-tetrahydropalmatine from crude extract of the African medicinal plant Enantia chlorantha. The crude extract from the root bark of E. chlorantha was fractionated on an analytical reversed-phase C(18) column by using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or acetic acid/H2O as a carrier and cetylpyridinium trifluoroacetate (or acetate) (1.9mg/mL) in 0.1% TFA (or acetic acid)/H2O as a displacer. Palmatine was quantitatively purified at >98% purity in the fully developed displacement mode. dl-Tetrahydropalmatine was semi-synthesized by NaBH4 reduction from crude palmatine and directly purified by HPDC. Both palmatine and dl-tetrahydropalmatine were identified by high-resolution electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR. This is the first report of one-step HPDC purification of natural and semi-synthetic products from a complex crude extract."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Natural Medicinal Chemistry, College of Science, Northwest A & F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Jin-Ming", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kamnaing", "ForeName": "Pierre", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kiyota", "ForeName": "Taira", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watchueng", "ForeName": "Jean", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kubo", "ForeName": "Takahiro", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jarussophon", "ForeName": "Suwatchai", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Konishi", "ForeName": "Yasuo", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3X69CO5I79", "NameOfSubstance": "tetrahydropalmatine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G50C034217", "NameOfSubstance": "palmatine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Annonaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18804774", "10.1016/j.chroma.2008.08.112", "S0021-9673(08)01437-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
