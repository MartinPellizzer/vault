Structure of <b>1</b> was decided by intensive study of NMR and mass spectra as 3-<i>O</i>-[4'-((1,3-dihydroxypropan-2-yl)oxy)-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside)]-4H-pyran-4-one, with uncommon glyceroxy side chain attached to 4' position of pyromeconic acid <i>\u03b2</i>-D-glucopyranoside. Antimicrobial potential of <b>1</b> was tested against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Salmonella enterica</i>, and <i>Candida albicans</i>. Compound <b>1</b> strongly inhibited growth of <i>Candida albicans</i> (MIC = 17.24\u2009\u00b5M/disc), compared to fluconazole (MIC = 16.33\u2009\u00b5M/disc). Meanwhile, it moderately inhibited the growth of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MIC = 71.84\u2009\u00b5M/disc) and <i>Salmonella enterica</i> (MIC = 71.84\u2009\u00b5M/disc), as compared with thiophenicol (MIC = 14.05\u2009\u00b5M/disc) and (MIC = 14.05\u2009\u00b5M/disc), respectively. The binding mode of <b>1</b> with the active site of sterol 14\u03b1-demethylase (CYP51) from <i>Candida albicans</i> (PDB ID: 5TZ1), in combination with fluconazole, was predicted by molecular docking study and supported the antifungal activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry of Natural Compounds Department, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Drug Industries Research, National Research Centre (NRC), Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abd El-Razek", "ForeName": "Mohamed H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7770-9793"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Drug Industries Research, National Research Centre (NRC), Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "El-Desoky", "ForeName": "Ahmed H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of the Chemistry of Natural and Microbial Products, Pharmaceutical and Drug Industries Institute, National Research Centre (NRC), Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Elgahamy", "ForeName": "Abdelhalim A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry of Medicinal Plants Department, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Drug Industries Research, National Research Centre (NRC), Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Bata", "ForeName": "Shaymaa M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry of Medicinal Plants Department, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Drug Industries Research, National Research Centre (NRC), Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mohamed", "ForeName": "Tarik A", "Initials": "TA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry of Medicinal Plants Department, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Drug Industries Research, National Research Centre (NRC), Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hegazy", "ForeName": "Mohamed-Elamir F", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38353145", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2315503"]}}]}
