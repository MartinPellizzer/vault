Oxidative damage to renal tubular epithelial cells induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the predominant cause of calcium oxalate stone formation. Hyperoside (Hyp) is a flavonol glycoside extracted from medicinal plants and appears to exhibit potent antioxidant activity in various cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of Hyp on renal cells exposed to oxidative stress simulated by oxalic acid (OA), and to determine whether the underlying mechanism involves the nuclear factor E2\u2011related factor2 (Nrf2)\u2011antioxidative response element signaling pathway. The study determined the indicators of high oxidative stress, including ROS and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in human kidney\u20112 cells and the results demonstrated that the levels of ROS, as evaluated by flow cytometry, and H2O2 were significantly increased following treatment with OA (5\u00a0mmol/l) for 24\u00a0h (OA group), compared with those in the untreated control group. The increased activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase in these cells explained this observation, as it is a major source of ROS. The results demonstrated that, in the OA group, the adhesion of calcium oxalate crystals and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly increased, and MTT assay demonstrated that cell viability was inhibited, compared with the control, which indicated that severe injury of cells was induced by OA. However, when the cells were pre\u2011treated with Hyp prior to treatment with OA (drug group), the levels of ROS and H2O2, and the activities of NADPH oxidase and LD were increased, and the adhesion of calcium oxalate crystals to cells was reduced, compared with the OA group. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the protein and mRNA expression levels of Nrf2, heme oxygenase\u20111 (HO\u20111) and NAD(P)H: quinineoxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) in the Hyp groups were significantly increased, compared with those in the OA group, with the exception of Nrf2 mRNA. These results suggested that Hyp had a marked protective effect on renal cells against the oxidative damage and cytotoxicity simulated by OA. This is the first report, to the best of our knowledge, demonstrating that the ability of Hyp to enhance the endogenous functions of antioxidation and detoxification in cells may involve the Nrf2/HO\u20111/NQO1 pathway."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Shaoxing Central Hospital, Shaoxing, Zhejiang 312030, P.R.
