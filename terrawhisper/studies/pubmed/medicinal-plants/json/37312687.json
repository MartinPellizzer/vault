Medicinal plants have had several vital chemical compounds, with some biological functions. Supplementation of these plants to the animals diets lead to significant betterments in the animals' productivity and health status. This study was designed to investigate the effects of <i>Malva parviflora</i> as a substitute for commercial premix carrier in the poultry diets to see the response on some of the productive and economic traits in broilers. 576 one day old Ross 308 chicks were randomly divided into eight groups with three replicate (24 bird /replicate) per group. Each group was subjected to the one of the following treatments: Tr 1. (Control) contained 2.5% of diet supplemented with homemade premix (with carrier Malva parviflora weed leaves meal), Tr 2. 2.5% provimi premix, Tr 3. 2.5% Turkis hpremix, Tr 4. Dutch premix, Tr 5. 50% homemade premix + 50% provimi premix, Tr 6. 50% homemade premix + 50% Turkish, Tr 7. Homemade premix + 50% Dutch 50% Tr 8. 25% from each four types premixes. Live body weight, feed consumption, feed conversion, growth rate\u060c Production Index\u060c economic indicator and mortality rate averages were measured to the 5 weeks of age. Result showed that there were significant differences (<i>P</i><0.05) among treatments in weight gains at all periods. Treatment 1\u060c26\u060c5 \u060c4\u060c showed the highest weight gain at 5 weeks of age;however, Tr.3\u060c7 showed the lowest value. There were significant differences (<i>P</i><0.05) in the rate of feed consumption among treatments during the different periods. Birds in Tr.3 consumed the highest amount of feed compared with control, Also there was significant differences in feed conversion ratio among all treatment groups at all periods where, the highest value was found in (Tr.3), and the lowest value was recorded in Tr.1.At least there was large differences in cost of locally premix which recorded the cheapest and lowest value about 1300 U.S.A$ less in every ton compared with the commercial premixes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Production, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Kufa, Kufa, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Kadam Abed Ameer", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Production, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Kufa, Kufa, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Mehmood Alkassar", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Randomized Controlled Trial, Veterinary", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Arch Razi Inst", "NlmUniqueID": "101549567", "ISSNLinking": "0365-3439"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Malva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Veshkurova O, Golubenko Z, Pshenichnov E, Arzanova I, Uzbekov V, Sultanova E, et al.
