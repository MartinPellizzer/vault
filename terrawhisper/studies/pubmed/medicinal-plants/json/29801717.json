Plants with a high luteolin content have been used ethnopharmacologically to treat inflammation-related symptoms. Both isolated luteolin and extracts from luteolin-rich plants have been studied using various models and exhibited anti-inflammatory activity.", "This paper uses recent research findings with a broad range of study models to describe the anti-inflammatory activity of luteolin, particularly its mechanisms at the molecular level; provide guidance for future research; and evaluate the feasibility of developing luteolin into an anti-inflammatory drug.", "We summarize reports about the anti-inflammatory activity of luteolin published since 2009, which we found in MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar. To acquire broad information, we extended our search to online FDA documents.", "Luteolin is a flavonoid commonly found in medicinal plants and has strong anti-inflammatory activity in vitro and in vivo. Some of its derivatives, such as luteolin-7-O-glucoside, have also shown anti-inflammatory activity. The action mechanism of luteolin varies, but Src in the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB pathway, MAPK in the activator protein (AP)-\u202f1 pathway, and SOCS3 in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway are its major target transcription factors. A clinical trial with a formulation containing luteolin showed excellent therapeutic effect against inflammation-associated diseases.", "In silico, in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies strongly suggest that the major pharmacological mechanism of luteolin is its anti-inflammatory activity, which derives from its regulation of transcription factors such as STAT3, NF-\u03baB, and AP-1. Much work remains to ensure the safety, quality, and efficacy of luteolin before it can be used to treat inflammation-related diseases in humans."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
