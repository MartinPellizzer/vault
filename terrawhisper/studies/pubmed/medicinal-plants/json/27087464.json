Chitosan is one of the several cationic polysaccharides found in nature. It is a natural biopolymer transformed from chitin which is a product of crustacean shells. Propolis is produced by honeybees through mixing the secretions of their hypopharyngeal glands with the digested product of resins collected from plants. Due to their excellent chemical and biological properties, chitosan and propolis arouse keen interest in dental science, including endodontics. There are various possibilities for applying propolis and chitosan based medicaments in endodontic treatment of root canals, and what is particularly emphasized is their potential effectiveness against resistant microorganisms such as E. faecalis and C. albicans, as well as biocompatible to the periapical tissues in comparison with the most commonly used agents. They aim at microflora which is difficult to eliminate, and their medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory, antifungal and antiseptic properties, make them suitable for use in endodontic treatment. Due to the potential side effects of commonly used synthetic drugs and other safety related reasons, natural alternatives for endodontic usage are continuously explored and tested. The paper presents the possibilities of applying propolis and chitosan in endodontic treatment on the basis of chosen articles published in recent years."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Conservative Dentistry and Pedodontics, Wroclaw Medical University, Krakowska 26, 50-425 Wroclaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Skoskiewicz-Malinowska", "ForeName": "Katarzyna", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kaczmarek", "ForeName": "Urszula", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Malicka", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Walczak", "ForeName": "Katarzyna", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zietek", "ForeName": "Marek", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mini Rev Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101094212", "ISSNLinking": "1389-5575"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9009-62-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Propolis"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9012-76-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Chitosan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Candida albicans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chitosan"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Endodontics"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enterococcus faecalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Propolis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27087464", "10.2174/1389557516666160418122510", "MRMC-EPUB-75052"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
