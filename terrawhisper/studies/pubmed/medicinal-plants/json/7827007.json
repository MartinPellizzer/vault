The absorption of Zn from the Ca-enriched milk (16.2%) and the bread made with lupin flour (27.0%) was similar to literature figures for comparable soya-bean products. The absorption from composite meals made with lupin flour (28.2%) and protein isolate (32.7%) was significantly higher than that reported for comparable soya-bean products. In a second experiment the absorption of Zn from a lupin-milk base and a soya-bean-milk base was compared with that from Ca-supplemented bases. The absorption of Zn from the lupin-milk base (26.3%) was significantly higher than from the soya-bean-milk base (17.6%), and neither was significantly altered by the addition of Ca. Overall the absorption of Zn from lupin-protein foods was found to be higher than from comparable soya-bean products. Lupin milk could be an attractive alternative to soya-bean milk for infant formulas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Department of Human Nutrition, Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Copenhagen, Denmark."}], "LastName": "Petterson", "ForeName": "D S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sandstr\u00f6m", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cederblad", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0372547", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J41CSQ7QDS", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Zinc"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zinc Radioisotopes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7827007", "10.1079/bjn19940091"]}}]}
