According to the size of inhibition zone on methylene blue flat with low pH, a model for screening anti-viral agents was developed. The conditions of assaying killing activity by well test assay were explored. With assaying the killing activity in different pH and temperature, it was found that the optimum pH range of 4.3-4.7 and the optimum temperature range of 20-22 degrees C in this screening model. To utilize this screening model, Several Chinese crude drugs had been studied and were found Flos Lonicerae and Rhizoma Cimicifugae have anti-viral effect. Such a model was to establish foundation for high throughput screening of anti-viral agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510641, China. btlipan@scut.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yao-wei", "Initials": "YW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Yan-rui", "Initials": "YR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ya-qin", "Initials": "YQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Wei Sheng Wu Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21610860R", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6209"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "K1 killer toxin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Killer Factors, Yeast"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Killer Factors, Yeast"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17672317"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
