The results indicated that soluble and insoluble G-HG complexes formed mainly through electrostatic interactions followed critical pH-dependent structure-forming events. The phase transition points (pH<sub>\u03c61</sub>, pH<sub>opt</sub> and pH<sub>\u03c62</sub>) shifted to lower pH with HG increased, whereas pH<sub>c</sub> kept constant. Conformational transitions of G from \u03b1-helix to \u03b2-sheet were promoted by interacting with HG, concurrent with changes in environment of hydrophobic residues. Additionally, CLSM evidenced phase transitions of G from homogeneity to separation occurred by interaction with HG, forming G-HG complexes with G centered and HG absorbed on the periphery. Findings aided in understanding interactions mechanism between G and HG to further apply HG in designing new food matrixes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
