Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) is a known anti-fibrotic cytokine. In this study we have investigated: a) the effect of IFN-gamma on collagen synthesis by arecoline-stimulated OSF fibroblasts in vitro (n=5), b) the effect of intra-lesional IFN-gamma on the fibrosis of OSF patients (n=29) and c) the immunohistochemical analysis of pre- and post-treatment inflammatory cell infiltrates and cytokine levels in the lesional tissue (n=29). The results show that the increased collagen synthesis in vitro in response to arecoline was inhibited in the presence of IFN-gamma (0.01-10.0 U/ ml) in a dose-related way. In an open uncontrolled study intra-lesional IFN-gamma treatment showed improvement in the patients mouth opening from an inter-incisal distance before treatment of 21 +/- 7 mm, to 30 +/- 7 mm immediately after treatment and 30 +/- 8 mm 6-months later, giving a net gain of 8 +/- 4 mm (42%) (range 4-15 mm). Patients also reported reduced burning dysaesthesia and increased suppleness of the buccal mucosa. The post-treatment immunohistochemistry showed a decreased amount of inflammatory cell infiltrate and an altered level of cytokines compared with the pre-treatment lesional tissue. The effect of IFN-gamma on collagen synthesis appears to be a key to the treatment of these patients, and intra-lesional injections of the cytokine may have a significant therapeutic effect on OSF."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University College London, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haque", "ForeName": "M F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meghji", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nazir", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harris", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "J Oral Pathol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8911934", "ISSNLinking": "0904-2512"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinergic Agonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4ALN5933BH", "NameOfSubstance": "Arecoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "82115-62-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Interferon-gamma"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Arecoline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinergic Agonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoenzyme Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intralesional"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Interferon-gamma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oral Submucous Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocyte Subsets"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco, Smokeless"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11140895", "10.1034/j.1600-0714.2001.300103.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
