Additionally, most of the synthesized compounds showed anti-proliferative activity against HepG2 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines at the micromolar range with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.04 to 4.71\u00a0\u03bcM, relative to sorafenib (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a02.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 and 3.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0\u03bcM against HepG2 and MCF-7, respectively). Also, compound 15 showed selectivity indices of 1.36 and 2.08 against HepG2 and MCF-7, respectively. Furthermore, compound 15 showed a significant apoptotic effect and arrested the cell cycle of MCF-7 cells at the S phase. Moreover, compound 15 had a significant inhibitory effect on the ability of MCF-7 cells to heal from. Docking studies revealed that the synthesized thiazolidine-2,4-diones have a binding pattern approaching sorafenib. MD simulations indicated the stability of compound 15 in the active pocket of VEGFR-2 for 200\u00a0ns. ADMET and toxicity studies indicated an acceptable pharmacokinetic profile. DFT studies confirmed the ability of compound 15 to interact with VEGFR-2.", "Compound 15 has promising anticancer activity targeting VEGFR-2 with significant activity as an apoptosis inducer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
