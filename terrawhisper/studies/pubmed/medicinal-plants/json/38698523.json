In December 2021, we observed leaf spots that were circular to irregular, gray with dark red margins and violet brown with brownish violet edges on the leaves of Photinia \u00d7 fraseri shrubs in the scenic area of Shenlongtan (28\u00b046'10\u2033N, 115\u00b042'93\u2033E), Jiangxi Province, China. Almost 15% of the leaves in the 1300 m2 Photinia \u00d7 fraseri planting area were symptomatic. Thirty symptomatic leaves were randomly collected from different plants, and sectioned into 5-mm2 pieces, which were surface-sterilized using 1% NaOCl for 30 s. After rinsing thrice in sterile distilled water and drying, the pieces were transferred onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 28 \u2103 for 5-7 days. A total of sixteen morphologically similar isolates were obtained. After incubation on PDA for 20 days, the fungi had irregular edges, were white to pale brown, and had spare aerial mycelium on the surface with irregularly distributed black, gregarious conidiomata. Conidia were fusoid, subcylindrical, straight to slightly curved, 4-septated, slightly constricted at the septa, and 23 to 36 \u00d7 6 to 10 \u03bcm (mean: 27.6 \u00d7 7.7 \u03bcm). The morphological characteristics were consistent with the features of Pseudopestalotiopsis species (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2014). The genomic DNA of two representative isolates (JFRL032 and JFRL033) was extracted for further identification. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, translation elongation factor 1-\u0251 (tef1-\u0251) and \u03b2-tubulin (tub2) genes were amplified and sequenced using primers ITS5/ITS4, EF1-526F/EF1-1567R, and Bt2A/Bt2B, respectively (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2012). The sequences of the two representative isolates were 100% identical to each other. These nucleotide sequences were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers, ON342794 and ON342795 (ITS); ON375851 and ON375852 (tef1-\u0251); ON375853 and ON375854 (tub2). BLASTn searches of the obtained sequences revealed 99%-100% to ITS (MG816316, 478/478 nucleotides), tef1-\u0251 (MG816336, 924/926 nucleotides), tub2 (MG816326, 441/442 nucleotides) sequences of the ex-type strain of Pseudopestalotiopsis ixorae (NTUCC17-001.1). Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using the concatenation of multiple sequences (ITS, tef1-\u0251 and tub2) with the Maximum likelihood statistics in PhyloSuite v1.2.2 (Zhang et al.2020). The phylogenetic tree showed the two isolates clustered with P. ixorae in a clade with 100% bootstrap support. The isolates were identified as P. ixorae based on morphological and molecular data. To confirm pathogenicity, eight healthy leaves of 3-year-old Photinia \u00d7 fraseri were surface sterilized, scratched with a pair of sterilized tweezers, and ten \u00b5l of conidial suspension (106 conidia/ml) was sprayed on the injured leaves and the control was sprayed with sterile distilled water. Then, All plants were potted in a climate chamber at 25\u2103 and 85% relative humidity. After 3 days, leaf spot symptoms similar to those described above were observed on inoculated leaves, while the non-inoculated leaves remained symptomless. The pathogen was reisolated from the inoculated leaves to fulfill Koch's postulates and confirmed as P. ixorae by morphological and molecular analysis. It has been reported that P. ixorae can infect the Ixora plant (Tsai et al., 2018). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of P. ixorae causing leaf spot on Photinia \u00d7 fraseri in China. The study provides valuable information for identifying and controlling the leaf spot on Photinia \u00d7 fraseri."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Agricultural University, 91595, Jiangxi Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Fungal Resources, Nanchang, China, 330045; 2602747810@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Qiping", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Agricultural University, 91595, Jiangxi Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Fungal Resources, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China; 2550579239@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Xiaolin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioengineering and Technological Research Centre for Edible and Medicinal Fungi, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China; 1090087071@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Shunying", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioengineering and Technological Research Centre for Edible and Medicinal Fungi, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China; 3554414021@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Nan", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhi Min AvenueNanchangNanchang, Jiangxi Province, China, 330045."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Agricultural University, Zhi Min Avenue, Zhi Min Avenue, China; fulve1204819952@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Yusen", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Fungal Resources, Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, China; 2369675702@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Huo", "ForeName": "Guanghua", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhi Min AvenueNanchangNanchang, Jiangxi Province, China, 330045."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Agricultural University, Zhi Min Avenue, Zhi Min Avenue, China; cycui@jxau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Chaoyu", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38698523", "10.1094/PDIS-08-23-1591-PDN"]}}]}
