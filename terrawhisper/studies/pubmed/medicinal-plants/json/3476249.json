In Pune district this condition involved soft palate, uvula and retromolar areas significantly more often than in Ernakulam district. The tongue, floor of the mouth and the hard palate were not involved in Pune. The age of the patients in Pune district was lower than in Ernakulam district. Associated oral cancer, leukoplakia and petechiae were observed solely among patients in Ernakulam. The most important etiologic factor for submucous fibrosis is the chewing of areca nut, and in both areas studied all patients chewed areca nut. In Pune, cured areca nut without other ingredients was chewed by 66% and in Ernakulam, raw areca nut was chewed as an ingredient of pan with tobacco by 100%. Thus in Ernakulam, the juice and the quid were mostly spat out, whereas in Pune they were swallowed. The regional variations in the characteristics of submucous fibrosis could be related to the differences in the areca nut chewing habit between the two areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bhonsle", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Murti", "ForeName": "P R", "Initials": "PR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Daftary", "ForeName": "D K", "Initials": "DK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "P C", "Initials": "PC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mehta", "ForeName": "F S", "Initials": "FS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sinor", "ForeName": "P N", "Initials": "PN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Irani", "ForeName": "R R", "Initials": "RR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pindborg", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "1-022-1", "Agency": "PHS HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Community Dent Oral Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0410263", "ISSNLinking": "0301-5661"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Oral Submucous Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3476249", "10.1111/j.1600-0528.1987.tb00526.x"]}}]}
