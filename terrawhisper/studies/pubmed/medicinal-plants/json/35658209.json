The different parts of C. aeruginosa were subjected to sequential extraction to give three fractions viz., hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol extract. The cytotoxic effect\u00a0and the mode of action against A-549 human\u00a0lung adenocarcinoma and HeLa cell\u00a0lines were examined. C. aeruginosa presented no significant toxic effect in normal human lung cells (L-132). The methanol extracts were found to be the most cytotoxic and further investigation was carried out to understand the effects. The methanol extracts induced DNA damage after 24\u00a0h with significant increase in tail DNA and tail moment when compared to untreated control. Up-regulation in the expression of the\u00a0caspase -\u00a08 and -\u00a03\u00a0activity was observed after 48\u00a0h of treatment. The mechanism of cell death and apoptosis induced by the methanol extracts on A549 and HeLa cells were studied using fluorescent staining. Bioactive compounds detected from the HPLC revealed phenol and flavonoid compounds: Gallic acid, quercetin, caffeic acid, kaempferol, rutin, coumaric acid and naringenin. GC-MS results identified the presence of sesquiterpenoids: \u03b1-curcumene, curzerene curcumenol, curzerenone epicurzerenone, caryophyllene oxide and diterpenoid, andrographolide. These compounds are known for inducing apoptosis in human cancer cells through caspase - dependent pathways. Therefore, C. aeruginosa and its potential to induce apoptosis in cancer cells suggest that they have potential in medical applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
