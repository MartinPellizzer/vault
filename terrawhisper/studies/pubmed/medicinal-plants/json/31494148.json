However, anti-IHNV drugs currently are scarce. For the purpose of seeking out anti-IHNV drugs, the anti-IHNV activities of 32 medicinal plants were investigated by using epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells. Among these plants, Prunella vulgaris L. (PVL) showed the strongest inhibition on IHNV replication with an inhibitory percentage of 99.3% at the concentration 100\u202fmg/L. Further studies demonstrated that ursolic acid (UA), a major constituent of PVL, also showed a highly effective anti-IHNV activity. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) at 72\u202fh of UA on IHNV was 8.0\u202f\u03bcM. Besides, UA could significantly decrease cytopathic effect (CPE) and the viral titer induced by IHNV in EPC cells. More importantly, UA also showed a strong anti-IHNV activity in vivo, as indicated by increasing the survival rate of rainbow trout and inhibiting viral gene expression. Intraperitoneal injection of UA increased the relative percentage of survival of rainbow trout by 18.9% and inhibited IHNV glycoprotein mRNA expression by > 90.0% in the spleen at the 1st-day post-infection. Altogether, UA was expected to be a therapeutic agent against IHNV infection in aquaculture."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
