At least two healers were present in every village visited, and over 42% of their case-load was concerned with diarrhoeal treatment. The investigation showed that a great variety of herbs/plants are used by traditional healers in the treatment of diarrhoeal diseases. All those interviewed used water as the main vehicle for their herbal preparations, the amount prescribed daily ranging from 20 ml to over 100 ml for children (in the case of 54.5% of healers) and 100 ml to over 500 ml for adults (56.6%); 26.4% of healers considered fluid supplements as mandatory and 70.5% advised patients to take as much fluid as possible. Only 3.1% of healers either limited or did not advise fluid intake. These findings indicate that traditional healers could play an important role in interventions to control diarrhoeal diseases using modern oral rehydration therapy if they are assisted to improve their techniques."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Makerere Medical School, Kampala, Uganda."}], "LastName": "Anokbonggo", "ForeName": "W W", "Initials": "WW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Odoi-Adome", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oluju", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Bull World Health Organ", "NlmUniqueID": "7507052", "ISSNLinking": "0042-9686"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea, Infantile"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Fluid Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Uganda"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Planta Med. 1972 Jun;21(4):364-73", "ArticleIdList": ["5074044"]}, {"Citation": "East Afr Med J. 1970 Nov;47(11):550-6", "ArticleIdList": ["5498988"]}, {"Citation": "East Afr Med J. 1964 May;41:211-8", "ArticleIdList": ["14168544"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Dis Child. 1961 Jun;36:305-15", "ArticleIdList": ["13727099"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2393983", "PMC2393057"]}}]}
