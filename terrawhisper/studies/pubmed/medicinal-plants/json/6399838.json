The two varieties were selected in a previous screening of toxicity in rats: one of them (Jalo) was lethal, and the other (Rico 23) was not, when injected intra-peritoneally. Different amounts of each one of the lectins were added to casein experimental diets and fed to rats. The amount of protein (casein) also varied from 5% to 20%. The addition to the diet of 1% lectins from the Jalo variety caused a growth depression, as well as a decrease in food efficiency ratio and serum glucose; also, it reduced the maltase and invertase activity of the intestinal mucosa. All these effects appeared when the protein contents in the rations were 5% or 10%. At the 20% level only a depression of the maltase activity was observed. Similar effects were shown by the lectins of the Rico 23 variety, but only when added in a higher (5%) percentage to the diet. The phosphatase and protease activity were not changed by any of the lectins. The inhibitor activity that occurred in vivo was not detected in vitro."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Figueroa", "ForeName": "M O", "Initials": "MO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mancini Filho", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lajolo", "ForeName": "F M", "Initials": "FM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "A\u00e7\u00e3o anti-nutricional das fito-hemaglutininas de Phaseolus vulgaris,L."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.26", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-Fructofuranosidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosidases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Growth"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "beta-Fructofuranosidase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6399838"]}}]}
