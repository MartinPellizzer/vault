These cultures were added the precursors of arbutin and salicin (phenylalanine, cinnamic, p-coumaric, p-anisoic, o-coumaric, salicylic acids, salicylaldehyde, helicin), not yet tested by the present authors. The culture of Schisandra chinensis was also added, besides the above-mentioned precursors, hydroquinone, because this culture had not been employed for biotransformation purposes yet. The precursors tested were used in a concentration of 100 mg x l(-1) and the period of their action was 6; 12; 24; 48, and 168 hours. Positive results (both TLC and HPLC) in arbutin production were obtained in the culture of Schisandra chinensis after an addition of hydroquinone. The largest amount of arbutin in callus cultures was measured after a week's cultivation with hydroquinone (5.08 %). In this experimental variant, arbutin was released also to the culture medium. Our results revealed salicylaldehyde to be the optimal precursor of salicin. It was transformed by the culture of Datura meteloides after 6; 24, and 168 hours and by the culture of Coronilla varia after 6 hours. In comparison with arbutin, its amount was smaller."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Univerzita Karlova v Praze, Farmaceutick\u00e1 fakulta v Hradci Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9, Katedra farmaceutick\u00e9 botaniky a ekologie. duskova@faf.cuni.cz"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duskov\u00e1", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dusek", "ForeName": "J'", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jahod\u00e1r", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Poustka", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Arbutin, salicin--moznosti jejich biotechnologick\u00e9 produkce."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Czech Republic", "MedlineTA": "Ceska Slov Farm", "NlmUniqueID": "9433765", "ISSNLinking": "1210-7816"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzyl Alcohols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4649620TBZ", "NameOfSubstance": "salicin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "C5INA23HXF", "NameOfSubstance": "Arbutin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Arbutin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Benzyl Alcohols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15895970"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
