Recently, it has been shown that celecoxib is associated with implications in complex diseases, such as Alzheimer disease and cancer as well as with cardiovascular risk assessment and toxicity, suggesting that celecoxib may affect multiple unknown targets. In this project, we detected targets of celecoxib within the nervous system using a label-free thermal proteome profiling method. First, proteins of the rat hippocampus were treated with multiple drug concentrations and temperatures. Next, we separated the soluble proteins from the denatured and sedimented total protein load by ultracentrifugation. Subsequently, the soluble proteins were analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to determine the identity of the celecoxib-targeted proteins based on structural changes by thermal stability variation of targeted proteins toward higher solubility in the higher temperatures. In the analysis of the soluble protein extract at 67\u00b0C, 44 proteins were uniquely detected in drug-treated samples out of all 478 identified proteins at this temperature. Ras-associated binding protein 4a, 1 out of these 44 proteins, has previously been reported as one of the celecoxib off targets in the rat central nervous system. Furthermore, we provide more molecular details through biomedical enrichment analysis to explore the potential role of all detected proteins in the biologic systems. We show that the determined proteins play a role in the signaling pathways related to neurodegenerative disease-and cancer pathways. Finally, we fill out molecular supporting evidence for using celecoxib toward the drug-repurposing approach by exploring drug targets. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study determined 44 off-target proteins of celecoxib, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and one of the most common medicines for treating inflammatory diseases. It shows that these proteins play a role in the signaling pathways related to neurodegenerative disease and cancer pathways. Finally, the study provides molecular supporting evidence for using celecoxib toward the drug-repurposing approach by exploring drug targets."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran (E.G., A.K.);Department of Psychology, College of Science and Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (R.K.);
