These compounds have been routinely used for the management of various chronic ailments and have gained considerable attention because of their significant efficacy and comparatively low side effects. Butein, a chacolnoid compound that has been isolated from various medicinal plants has exhibited a wide range of beneficial pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-angiogenic in diverse disease models. This article briefly summarizes the past published literature related to the therapeutic and protective effects of butein, as demonstrated in various models of human chronic diseases. Further analysis of its important cellular targets, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic profile may further significantly expand its therapeutic application."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, MD9-04-11, 2 Medical Drive, Singapore, 117597, Singapore."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Ziwei", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117600, Singapore."}], "LastName": "Shanmugam", "ForeName": "Muthu K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, MD9-04-11, 2 Medical Drive, Singapore, 117597, Singapore."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biotechnology and Nanotechnology, A*STAR, The Nanos, #04-01, 31 Biopolis Way, Singapore, 138669, Singapore."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, 1 CREATE Way, #10-01 CREATE Tower, Singapore, 138602, Singapore."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mechanobiology Institute, National University of Singapore, T-Lab, #05-01, 5A Engineering Drive 1, Singapore, 117411, Singapore."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Hanry", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117600, Singapore. phcgs@nus.edu.sg."}], "LastName": "Sethi", "ForeName": "Gautam", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Adv Exp Med Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0121103", "ISSNLinking": "0065-2598"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4WVS5M0LGF", "NameOfSubstance": "butein"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Chalcones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27671826", "10.1007/978-3-319-41334-1_17"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
