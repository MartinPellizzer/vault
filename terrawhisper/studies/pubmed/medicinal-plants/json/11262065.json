Accordingly, our objective was to isolate and partially characterize a CPI from lima bean. The isolation scheme included water extraction of lima bean flour followed by a chromatography series using DEAE Sepharose, Phenyl Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. This scheme resulted in the partial purification of a approximately 20 000-dalton protein with high inhibitory activity against papain. This isolated lima bean CPI had an N-terminal sequence homologous with other members of the cystatin class of CPIs. The protein was relatively heat labile; suggesting it could be inactivated with normal cooking, which is favorable for its use in transforming plants to create insect resistance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, 1160 Food Science Building, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907-1160, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lawrence", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nielsen", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cystatins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Cystatins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Alignment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11262065", "10.1021/jf0007333", "jf0007333"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
