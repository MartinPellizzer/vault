This study was undertaken to evaluate the antioxidant activity of <i>Mondia whitei</i> (MW) and <i>Guibourtia tessmannii</i> (GT) against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity in PC3 cells. The phytochemical composition of MW and GT was determined by GC-MS analysis. Total phenolic (TP) and total flavonoid (TF) contents were quantified by Folin Ciocalteu and AlCl<sub>3</sub> methods, respectively. The antioxidant potential of the extracts was determined using the DPPH and ABTS<sup>+</sup> radicals scavenging method, as well as cupric and ferric reducing capacity assay. Moreover, all phytocompounds were docked against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) using ArgusLab, and results were analyzed using the BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer 2021 client. MW and GT comprised 20 and 22 compounds, respectively. GT exhibited higher TP and TF contents (210.70\u2009\u00b1\u200912.7; 12.61\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3 GAE/g DW) compared to MW (132.59\u2009\u00b1\u200912.59; 5.53\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\u2009mg of GAE/g DW). Both MW and GT demonstrated substantial antioxidant activity, with GT proving to be more effective in preventing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity. For instance, MW and GT significantly (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u2009.001) increased the DPPH, ABTS<sup>+,</sup> and cupric activity, compared with the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> group. All compounds identified in MW and GT exhibited a strong binding affinity against AChE and GST. Drug likeness and toxicity of all phytocompounds were under the acceptable norms of Lipinski's rule. In conclusion, these plants could be effective candidates for the management/treatment of oxidative stress-related disorders.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
