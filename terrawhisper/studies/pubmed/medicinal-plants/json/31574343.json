Seventy-eight patients were ineligible and 11 of them refused from participating. Thirty-nine PD patients (YAHR staging\u202f\u2264\u202f3) were divided into two groups by random. The patients received oral licorice or placebo syrups with a dose of 5\u202fcc, twice a day for 6 months. High-performance liquid chromatography and spectrophotometric instruments determined licorice syrup constituents. The patients' situation for Unified Parkinson's rating scale (UPDRS) was assessed every 6 weeks for the duration of six months. In addition, patients' blood pressure, blood glucose, sodium and potassium levels, quality of life and dizziness were determined.", "Six weeks after intervention, total UPDRS, daily activities and tremor were significantly improved with a considerable effect size. A significant better motor test and rigidity scores were observed 4 months after licorice intake (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). No electrolyte abnormality, significant changes in blood pressure or blood glucose levels were observed during the study. Each 5cc of syrup contained 136\u202fmg of licorice extract with 12.14\u202fmg glycyrrhizic acid, and also 136\u202f\u03bcg of polyphenols.", "The licorice intake could improve the symptoms in PD patients without serious adverse events."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
