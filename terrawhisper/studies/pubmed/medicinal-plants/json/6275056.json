The protein content varied from 47.7% dry weight (raw seeds) to 65.3% (oil-cake). Compared to the FAO reference pattern sulfur- containing amino acids are first limiting. The water-extracted sample contained 26.9% oil and the polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratio of 30 seed samples was 5.3. Alkaloid content of raw seed was high (3.3%), but could be reduced or nearly eliminated by water-and-alcohol extraction or plant breeding. Other anti-nutritive substances were present only in trace quantities. Protein quality measured as protein efficiency ratio (PER) gave low values for the non-supplemented lupin proteins (1.34 semi-sweet variety; 1.53 water-extracted seeds; 1.19 oil-cake; 3.09 casein), but the PER's were improved by the addition of 0.2% DL-methionine to the diets (3.05, 2.69, 2,81, respectively). Raw as well as processed lupin protein showed an excellent apparent digestibility (80.0-85.8%, casein 87.1%). Studies of net protein utilization (NPU) and biological value (BV) confirmed the importance of methionine supplementation, The true digestibility of 92% was equivalent to that of casein."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schoeneberger", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gross", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cremer", "ForeName": "H D", "Initials": "HD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Elmadfa", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2WTB3V159F", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Cyanide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemagglutination Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Cyanide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6275056", "10.1093/jn/112.1.70"]}}]}
