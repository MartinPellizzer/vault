Satisfactory oral rehydration, as assessed clinically and by changes in PCV and total serum solids (TSS), was achieved in 90.9% with WHO ORS, 96.8% with pop rice, and 96.6% in the mung bean ORS treated group (p greater than 0.05). The purging rates (ml/kg/h) until recovery were 2.49 +/- 1.5 (pop rice); 2.91 +/- 2.0 (WHO), and 3.41 +/- 1.7 in the mung bean group (p greater than 0.05). The percentage of patients recovering from diarrhea within the 72 h study period was 58.0 (pop rice), 48.4 (WHO), and 44.8 for mung bean group (p greater than 0.05). Though differences in stool volumes and duration in the three groups were not statistically different, there was a trend toward improvement in efficacy with the pop rice ORS in several parameters: greater weight gain, higher percentage decline in TSS, higher urine output despite lower ORS intake, and lower purging rates. The intake of semisolids in the 24-72 h study period was also higher in the pop rice group as compared to the other two groups (p less than 0.05). The number of breast feeds and intake of artificial milk was however similar in all groups (p greater than 0.05)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi."}], "LastName": "Bhan", "ForeName": "M K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ghai", "ForeName": "O P", "Initials": "OP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khoshoo", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vasudev", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bhatnagar", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Arora", "ForeName": "N K", "Initials": "NK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rashmi"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stintzing", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8211545", "ISSNLinking": "0277-2116"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Electrolytes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose Solution, Hypertonic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Breast Feeding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dehydration"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea, Infantile"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Electrolytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Fluid Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose Solution, Hypertonic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3430248", "10.1097/00005176-198705000-00016"]}}]}
