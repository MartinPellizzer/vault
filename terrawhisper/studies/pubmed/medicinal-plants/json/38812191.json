The content of tanshinones and 28 inorganic elements in Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma samples from 18 producing areas in 6 provinces was determined, and 35 physical and chemical properties of the corresponding soil samples were determined. The enrichment characteristics of inorganic elements in Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma were analyzed. The correlation analysis and stepwise regression analysis were performed to screen out the main soil factors affecting the content of tanshinones in Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma. The results showed that the content of tanshinones in the samples from different areas varied significantly, being the highest in the samples from Shandong, the second in the samples from Henan, and low in the samples from Shanxi and Sichuan. K, Mg, Ca, and Na were rich in Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma samples, among which Na and K had the highest enrichment coefficients. The results of correlation and regression analyses showed that soil K, Na, Ti, and total nitrogen were the main soil factors affecting the tanshinones in Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma. Specifically, the content of tanshinones was positively correlated with Ti and negatively correlated with Na, K, and total nitrogen in the soil. Therefore, during the planting of Salvia miltiorrhiza, the land should be selected with full consideration to the salinity and saline land should be avoided. Secondly, the application of nitrogen and potassium fertilizers can be appropriately reduced, and water-soluble elemental fertilizers for S. miltiorrhiza should be developed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137, China State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China Key Laboratory of Biology and Cultivation of Herb Medicine, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Yao-Yao", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China Dexing Research and Training Center of Chinese Medical Sciences Dexing 334220, China Key Laboratory of Biology and Cultivation of Herb Medicine, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Bin-Bin", "Initials": "BB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China Key Laboratory of Biology and Cultivation of Herb Medicine, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ningbo Joysun Product Testing Service Co., Ltd.
