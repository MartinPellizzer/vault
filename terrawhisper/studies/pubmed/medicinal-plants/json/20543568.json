ZBB-006 is a new synthetic diterpenoid derivative which exhibited significant anti-proliferation activity against various cancer cell lines in our previous study. Here, we investigated the antitumor effect of ZBB-006 and its potential mechanisms in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, both in vitro and in vivo. We found that oral administration of ZBB-006 effectively suppressed the growth of HepG2 xenograft tumor in nude mice without body weight decline as compared with the control group. Meanwhile, the growth inhibitory effect of ZBB-006 on HepG2 cells was observed with MTT assay. Apoptosis induced by ZBB-006 in HepG2 cells was evidenced by DAPI staining and Annexin V/PI double staining assay. ZBB-006 also dissipated the mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) apparently as revealed by JC-1 staining. Furthermore, the cleavage of PARP, activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 but not caspase-8 was demonstrated by western blot assay both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the proapoptotic protein Bax was markedly elevated, while the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was downregulated. Collectively, our data indicated that ZBB-006 exerted a strong antitumor effect on HepG2 cells by initiating the mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, and it has potential to be explored as a new promising therapeutic agent against human hepatoma."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Qian-Qian", "Initials": "QQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qiu-Juan", "Initials": "QJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Bu-Bing", "Initials": "BB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Wen-Hao", "Initials": "WH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yu-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Biol Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "101137842", "ISSNLinking": "1538-4047"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzimidazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbocyanines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ZBB-006"}, {"RegistryNumber": "21527-78-6", "NameOfSubstance": "5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolocarbocyanine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzimidazoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbocyanines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Growth Processes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hep G2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Nude"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20543568", "10.4161/cbt.10.3.12425", "12425"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
