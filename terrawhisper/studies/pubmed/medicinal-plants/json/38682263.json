The polyA apt, adsorbed on the AuNPs, especially can bind to the analyte while deterring non-specific interactions. This nano aptasensor uses cationic polymer poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDDA), as an aggregating agent, to aggregate gold nanoparticles. PolyA apt-decorated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs/polyA apt) show resistance to PDDA-induced aggregation and maintains their dispersed state (red color) with the optical absorbance signal at <i>\u03bb</i> = 520 nm. However, in the presence of AFB1 in the assay solution, the specific aptamer reacts with high affinity and folds into its three-dimensional form. Aggregation of AuNPs induced by PDDA caused their optical signal shift to <i>\u03bb</i> = 620 nm (blue color). AFB1 concentration in the bioassay solution determines the amount of optical signal shift. Therefore, optical density ratio in two wavelengths (<i>A</i><sub>620/520</sub>) can be used as a sturdy colorimetric signal to detect the concentration of aflatoxin B1. AFB1 was linearly detected between 0.5 and 20 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>, with a detection limit of 0.09 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> (S/N = 3). The fabricated aptasensor was applied to the detection of AFB1 in real corn samples."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2194-8605"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nutrition Health Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran. omid.shayesteh777@gmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shayesteh", "ForeName": "Omid Heydari", "Initials": "OH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Derakhshandeh", "ForeName": "Katayoun", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nutrition Health Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran. omid.shayesteh777@gmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology and Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ranjbar", "ForeName": "Akram", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahjub", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dental Research Center, School of Dentistry, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Farmany", "ForeName": "Abbas", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Anal Methods", "NlmUniqueID": "101519733", "ISSNLinking": "1759-9660"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "polyadenine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "poly-N,N-dimethyl-N,N-diallylammonium chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxin B1"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gold"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Colorimetry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aptamers, Nucleotide"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biosensing Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Poly A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limit of Detection"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "29"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38682263", "10.1039/d4ay00605d"]}}]}
