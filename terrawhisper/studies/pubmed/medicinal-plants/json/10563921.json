After 21 h of extraction by methanol and removal of chlorophyll, ethyl acetate was used to separate oligomeric and polymeric polyphenols: 0.07% of oligomeric and 0.13% of polymeric polyphenols were found. After acidic hydrolysis of the oligomeric polyphenols, it was established by TLC, HPLC, and FAB mass spectra that kaempferol was the unique aglycon of the three main oligomeric constituents of S. tectorum. Paper chromatography suggested delphinidol to be the only anthocyanidin detectable in the material obtained by acidic hydrolysis of the polymeric polyphenol fraction. After Haslam degradation of the same polymeric polyphenol fraction, only 4-thiobenzyl-(-)-epigallocatechin and 4-thiobenzyl-(-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate were found and tentatively identified. We concluded that procyanidins of B2 type could be the major components of the polymeric polyphenol fraction of this plant. Antimicrobial activity of Sempervivum L. leaves against six of seven selected microorganisms was observed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. veronika.abram@bf.uni-lj.si"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abram", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Donko", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10563921", "10.1021/jf980669d", "jf980669d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
