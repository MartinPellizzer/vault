The irradiation doses ranged from 0 to 12.5 kGy. The counts performed were total mesophilic aerobic microorganisms, Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, sulfite-reducing clostridia, molds, and yeasts. It was concluded that molds, yeasts, and sulfite-reducing clostridia were the most resistant species, although a 10-kGy dose of irradiation leads to optimum sanitation. Extractable color and apparent color were analyzed to appraise the incidence of the irradiation treatments in the color properties of red paprika. Extractable color was determined according to the American Spice Trade Association method, and apparent color was analyzed by reflectance using the CIELab color space. Data showed no significant differences between the color properties of irradiated and nonirradiated samples. Irradiation was a suitable procedure to minimize the bioburden of red paprika with small modifications of its color properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural Chemistry Department, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Murcia, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nieto-Sandoval", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Almela", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fern\u00e1ndez-L\u00f3pez", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mu\u00f1oz", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pigments, Biological"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enterobacteriaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Irradiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10826721", "10.4315/0362-028x-63.5.633", "S0362-028X(22)00105-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
