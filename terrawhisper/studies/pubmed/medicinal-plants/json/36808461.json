In particular, species belonging to the genus Taxus, which are the only natural source for the anti-tumor medicine paclitaxel, are known to be highly sensitive to environmental changes. To investigate the response of Taxus spp. to heavy metal stress, we analyzed the transcriptomic profiles of Taxus media trees exposed to cadmium (Cd2+). In total, six putative genes from the metal tolerance protein (MTP) family were identified in T. media, including two Cd2+ stress inducible TMP genes (TmMTP1, TmMTP11 and Taxus media). Secondary structure analyses predicted that TmMTP1 and TmMTP11, which are members of the Zn-CDF and Mn-CDF subfamily proteins, respectively, contained six and four classic transmembrane domains, respectively. The introduction of TmMTP1/11 into the \u2206ycf1 yeast cadmium-sensitive mutant strain showed that TmMTP1/11 might regulate the accumulation of Cd2+ to yeast cells. To screen the upstream regulators, partial promoter sequences of the TmMTP1/11 genes were isolated using the chromosome walking method. Several myeloblastosis (MYB) recognition elements were identified in the promoters of these genes. Furthermore, two Cd2+-induced R2R3-MYB TFs, TmMYB16 and TmMYB123, were identified. Both in vitro and in vivo assays confirmed that TmMTB16/123 play a role in Cd2+ tolerance by activating and repressing the expression of TmMTP1/11 genes. The present study elucidated new regulatory mechanisms underlying the response to Cd stress and can contribute to the breeding of Taxus species with high environmental adaptability."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.
