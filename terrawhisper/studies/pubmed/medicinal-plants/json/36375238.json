Therefore, targeting CSCs may be a promising approach. Recently, discovery and research on phytochemicals that effectively target colorectal CSCs have been gaining popularity because of their broad safety profile and multi-target and multi-pathway modes of action.", "This review aimed to elucidate and summarise the effects and mechanisms of phytochemicals with potential anti-CSC agents that could contribute to the better management of CRC.", "We reviewed PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Ovid, ScienceDirect and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases from the original publication date to March 2022 to review the mechanisms by which phytochemicals inhibit CRC progression by targeting CSCs and their key signalling pathways. Phytochemicals were classified and summarised based on the mechanisms of action.", "We observed that phytochemicals could affect the biological properties of colorectal CSCs. Phytochemicals significantly inhibit self-renewal, migration, invasion, colony formation, and chemoresistance and induce apoptosis and differentiation of CSCs by regulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway (e.g., diallyl trisulfide and genistein), the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway (e.g., caffeic acid and piperlongumine), the neurogenic locus notch homolog protein pathway (e.g., honokiol, quercetin, and \u03b1-mangostin), the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway (e.g., curcumin, morin, and ursolic acid), and other key signalling pathways. It is worth noting that several phytochemicals, such as resveratrol, silibinin, evodiamine, and thymoquinone, highlight multi-target and multi-pathway effects in restraining the malignant biological behaviour of CSCs.", "This review demonstrates the potential of targeted therapies for colorectal CSCs using phytochemicals. Phytochemicals could serve as novel therapeutic agents for CRC and aid in drug development."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier GmbH.
