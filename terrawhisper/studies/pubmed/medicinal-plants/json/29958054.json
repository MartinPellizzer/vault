The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activities and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses of the essential oil of <i>S. suffruticosa</i> from four regions in Kerman: Hezar Mountain, Laleh Zar, Bidkhan, and Rabor. The essential oil of this plant was extracted by Clevenger. The antibacterial activities were evaluated against three Gram-negative bacteria (<i>P. aeruginosa, K. pneumonia, Acinetobacter</i>) and three Gram-positive bactria (<i>B. subtilis, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae</i>). By disk diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were determined. The composition of essential oil was identified by GC-MS analysis. In our study, most yield of essential oil of <i>S. suffruticosa</i> was 1.2% from the Laleh Zar region and the main components were Z-\u03b2-ocimene (25.4%) in Laleh Zar, linalool (17.7%) in Hezar, Z-\u03b2-ocimene (18.5%) in Bidkhan, and \u03b2-pinene (10.5%) in the Rabor region. Maximum inhibition zone by the essential oil from region Bidkhan was observed against <i>K. pneumoniae</i> (30\u00a0mm). The MIC value for <i>S. suffruticosa</i> collected from Laleh Zar was 1.25\u00a0mg/ml against <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>S. pneumonia.</i> The results of this study confirm that the significant antibacterial effects of <i>S. suffruticosa</i> and make it a valuable compound in essential oils for pharmaceutical use and a good replacement for chemical antibiotics. Environmental conditions can result in a difference in yields and components; this can be considered significant potential for this plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Science , Kerman , Iran."}], "LastName": "Khoddami", "ForeName": "Mojtaba", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Faculty Of Biological Science, Alzahra University , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Sheikh Hosseini", "ForeName": "Mehrnaz", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9899-7168"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman , Kerman , Iran."}], "LastName": "Hassanshahian", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Diet Suppl", "NlmUniqueID": "101249830", "ISSNLinking": "1939-0211"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29958054", "10.1080/19390211.2018.1472167"]}}]}
