Forty four such medicinal plant samples were collected from local markets and evaluated for the presence of 14 elements (Mn, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Al, Pb, Ba, Zn, Ag, Hg, Bi, Cd). Microwave-assisted digestion with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was applied to determine the elemental composition in these medicinal plants. Widespread occurrence of these elements was observed in all plant samples, except for Bi and Co where the lowest mean values of 0.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04 and 0.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15 were observed, respectively. The descending order for mean (\u03bcg/g) elemental occurrence observed was as follows: Ba > Al > Zn > Ni > Mn > Ba > Hg > Mo > Cu > Cr > Ag > Cd > Co > Bi, whereas the range for these elements in the 44-medicinal plants was as follows: Pb > Al > Zn > Ni > Mn > Cu > Mo > Ag > Ba > Hg > Co > Cd > Cr > Bi. Pb, Hg and Cd were found beyond the maximum limits in these medicinal plants, while the remaining elements were found well within the range of maximum limits. A number of medicinal plants showed high amounts of these elements. Some plants contained more than one element, such as <i>Foeniculum vulgare</i> Mill (Pb, Hg, Cd), <i>Ricinus communis</i> (Pb, Cd), <i>Vigna radiata</i> (Pb, Cd) and <i>Sesamum indicum</i> (Pb, Hg). The data matrix was validated through the statistical tools of principal component analysis (<i>X<sup>2</sup>\u00a0</i>=\u00a0160.44, <i>P</i> =\u00a0.00), Pearson's correlation (<i>P</i> =\u00a0.01 and 0.05), and K-mean cluster analysis (F\u00a0=\u00a0104.55, <i>P</i> =\u00a0.00). The findings of the study provide baseline data for the comparative analysis of these medicinal plants, which may help select safe medicinal plants in terms of consumer-based use and its utilisation for the treatment of various ailments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Products and Alternative Medicine, College of Clinical Pharmacy, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Rizwan", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Clinical Pharmacy, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Shaaban", "ForeName": "Heba", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forensic Medicine and Clinical Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Issa", "ForeName": "Sahar Y", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Clinical Pharmacy, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alsaad", "ForeName": "Anwar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Clinical Pharmacy, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alghamdi", "ForeName": "Majd", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Clinical Pharmacy, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Hamid", "ForeName": "Njoud", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Clinical Pharmacy, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Osama", "ForeName": "Rand", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Clinical Pharmacy, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Algarni", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Clinical Pharmacy, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Mostafa", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Clinical Pharmacy, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alqarni", "ForeName": "Abdulmalik M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Products and Alternative Medicine, College of Clinical Pharmacy, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Aldholmi", "ForeName": "Mohammed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Shaheed Benazir Bhutto University Sheringal Dir Upper Khyber Pakhtun Khwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Riaz", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Addit Contam Part B Surveill", "NlmUniqueID": "101317183", "ISSNLinking": "1939-3210"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}, {"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FXS1BY2PGL", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercury"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mercury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saudi Arabia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "5"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35320694", "10.1080/19393210.2022.2053591"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
