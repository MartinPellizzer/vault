Effective drugs for managing NNV infection are urgently required. Medicinal plants have been known for thousands of years and benefit of medicinal plants against pathogens in aquaculture have emerged. Nowadays, the most commonly used method for detecting virus infection and assessing antiviral drugs efficacy is reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR. However, the application is limited on account of high reagent costs, complex time-consuming operations and long detection time. Aptamers have been widely applied in application of pathogens or diseases diagnosis and treatments because of high specificity, strong affinity, good stability, easy synthesized and low costs. This study aimed to establish an aptamer (GBN34)-based high-throughput screening (GBN34-AHTS) model for efficient selection and evaluation of natural ingredients against NNV infection. GBN34-AHTS is an expeditious rapid method for selecting natural ingredients against NNV, which is characterized with high-speed, dram, sensitive and accurate. AHTS strategy could reduce work intensity and experimental costs and shorten the whole screening cycle of effective ingredients. AHTS should be suitable for rapid selection of effective ingredients against other viruses, which is important for improving the prevention and controlling of aquatic diseases."],
