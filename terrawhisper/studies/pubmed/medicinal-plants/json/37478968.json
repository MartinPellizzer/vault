It is a valuable medicinal plant to prevent and treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Lysine succinylation, a widespread modification found in various organisms, plays a critical role in regulating secondary metabolism in plants. The hairy roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza were subject to proteomic analysis to identify lysine succinylation sites using affinity purification and HPLC-MS/MS in this investigation. Our findings reveal 566 lysine succinylation sites in 348 protein sequences. We observed 110 succinylated proteins related to secondary metabolism, totaling 210 modification sites. Our analysis identified 53 types of enzymes among the succinylated proteins, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). PAL, a crucial enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of rosmarinic acid and flavonoids, displayed succinylation at two sites. ALDH, which participates in the phenylpropane metabolic pathway, was succinylated at 8 eight sites. These observations suggest that lysine succinylation may play a vital role in regulating the production of secondary metabolites in Salvia miltiorrhiza. Our study may provide valuable insights for further investigation on plant succinylation, specifically as a reference point.
