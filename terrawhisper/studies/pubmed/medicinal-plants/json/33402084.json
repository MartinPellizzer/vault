Efforts to combat and treat the different forms of this disease is also evolving. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a lethal form of cancer, which is prevalent in Southern China, that is normally treated by using radiotherapy. Here, we will review products obtained from natural sources that have potential cytotoxic and apoptotic properties against NPC. These include grifolin, dihydroartemisinin, luteolin, honokiol, indole-3-carbinol, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, 6-O-angeloylenolin, cucurbitacin E, genistein, helenalin, celastrol, coronarin D, quercetin, trans-cinnamaldehyde, 5'-epimer episilvestrol, silvestrol, arnicolide D, brevilin A, and baicalin hydrate. Ethyl acetate extracts of Wedelia chinensis and aqueous extracts of Ajuga bracteosa are also included although the bioactive compounds involved have yet to be identified. The known mechanism of action of these products is discussed. It is anticipated that one or more of these substances may provide the general population with alternative and cost-effective ways to combat this fatal disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory of Southwest Endangered Medicinal Resources Development, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, 189 Changgang Road, Nanning 530023, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Dan-Na", "Initials": "DN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory of Southwest Endangered Medicinal Resources Development, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, 189 Changgang Road, Nanning 530023, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shuo", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory of Southwest Endangered Medicinal Resources Development, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, 189 Changgang Road, Nanning 530023, China."}], "LastName": "Sooranna", "ForeName": "Suren R", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory of Southwest Endangered Medicinal Resources Development, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, 189 Changgang Road, Nanning 530023, China."}], "LastName": "Miao", "ForeName": "Jian-Hua", "Initials": "JH"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2018FY100700", "Agency": "National Science and Technology Fundamental Resources Investigation Program of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mini Rev Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101094212", "ISSNLinking": "1389-5575"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6379-55-1", "NameOfSubstance": "grifolin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle Checkpoints"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Herpesvirus 4, Human"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Activation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "29"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33402084", "10.2174/1389557521666210105113831", "MRMC-EPUB-113051"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
