The phylogeny of the wild Goji berry and the domestication of cultivated Goji berry are important scientific and practical value due to the medicinal and economic value. In this paper, a new advances achieved in studies on the phylogeny of wild Goji berry is summarized. The origin of cultivated Goji berry includes when, where, how and ancestral specie were reviewed. The current situation of cultivation and existing problems were summarized. We considered that through mutations and artificial selections, wild ancestors were domesticated to current cultivar groups. To find direct evidence for the origin of cultivated Goji berry, we must rely on genetic analysis in addition to morphological characters. To make full use of the Goji berry germplasm resources, the investigation and mining on wild Goji berry resource should be strengthened in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Experimental Research Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Rui-Feng", "Initials": "RF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ji'nan 250355, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Academy of Chinese Medicine, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lu-Qi", "Initials": "LQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Lycium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29192436", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170814.006"]}}]}
