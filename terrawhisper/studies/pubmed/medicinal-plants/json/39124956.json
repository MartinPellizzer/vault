Using the RRLC-Q-TOF-MS-Based Metabolic Profile and In Vitro Anti-Inflammatory Activity.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["<i>Eupatorium lindleyanum</i> DC. (EL) is a traditional Chinese herb known for its phlegm-reducing, cough-relieving and asthma-calming properties. It is widely used for treating cough and bronchitis. However, preliminary experiments have revealed wide variations in the composition of its different medicinal parts (flowers, leaves and stems), and the composition and efficacy of its different medicinal parts remain largely underexplored at present. In this study, non-targeted rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with a quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (RRLC-Q-TOF-MS)-based metabolomics approach was developed to investigate the differences in the chemical composition of different medicinal parts of EL. We identified or tentatively identified 9 alkaloids, 11 flavonoids, 14 sesquiterpene lactones, 3 diterpenoids and 24 phenolic acids. In addition, heatmap visualization, quantitative analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-PDA) and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) showed particularly high levels of sesquiterpene lactones, flavonoids and phenolic acids in the flowers, such as eupalinolide A and B and chlorogenic acid, among others. The leaves also contained some flavonoid sesquiterpene lactones and phenolic acids, while the stems were almost absent. The findings of in vitro activity studies indicated that the flowers exhibited a notable inhibitory effect on the release of the inflammatory factors TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, surpassing the anti-inflammatory efficacy observed in the leaves. Conversely, the stems demonstrated negligible anti-inflammatory activity. The variations in anti-inflammatory activity among the flowers, leaves and stems of EL can primarily be attributed to the presence of flavonoids, phenolic acids and sesquiterpene lactones in both the flowers and leaves. Additionally, the flowers contain a higher concentration of these active components compared to the leaves. These compounds mediate their anti-inflammatory effects through distinct biochemical pathways. The results of this study are anticipated to provide a scientific basis for the rational and effective utilization of EL resources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
