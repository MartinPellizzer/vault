Vero cells were further incubated with FeSO<sub>4</sub> for 30\u00a0min, following pretreatment with C. sativa extracts for 25\u00a0min. Normal control consisted of Vero cells not treated with the extracts and/or FeSO<sub>4</sub>, while untreated (negative) control consisted of cells treated with only FeSO<sub>4</sub>.", "MTT assay revealed the extracts were slightly cytotoxic at the highest concentrations (250\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). There was a significant depletion in glutathione level and catalase activity on induction of oxidative stress, with significant elevation in malondialdehyde level, acetylcholinesterase, ATPase, ENTPDase, fructose-1,6-biphosphatase, glucose 6-phosphatase and glycogen phosphorylase activities. These activities and levels were significantly reversed following pretreatment with C. sativa extracts.", "These results portray the protective potentials of C. sativa against iron-mediated oxidative renal injury as depicted by the ability of its extracts to mitigate redox imbalance and suppress acetylcholinestererase activity, while concomitantly modulating purinergic and glucogenic enzymes activities in Vero cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
