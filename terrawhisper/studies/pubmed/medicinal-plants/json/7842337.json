The results indicated that in the experiment and control groups, the height of fundus and fetal diparietal diameter (BPD) gradually approached to those of the normal pregnancy group. The urinary estrogens/creatinine (E/C) ratio and serum human placental lactogen (hPL) were close to those of the normal pregnancy group (P > 0.05) after 35 gestational weeks. The weight of neonates treated nutritionally and with ginseng saponin approached to that of the normal pregnancy group. There was no significant difference as compared with the normal pregnancy group (P > 0.05). Glucose and albumen levels in blood of neonates were not significantly different between experiment and control groups, but they were higher than those in IUGR group (P < 0.05). The present results suggest that in treating IUGR, ginseng saponin may show the same effect as in the nutritional treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Second Teaching Hospital, Bethune University of Medical Sciences, Changchun."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "W Y", "Initials": "WY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Teng", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "7511141", "ISSNLinking": "0376-2491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Fetal Growth Retardation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pre-Eclampsia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7842337"]}}]}
