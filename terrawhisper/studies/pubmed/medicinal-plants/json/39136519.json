Among these compounds is rutin, a polyphenolic flavanol found in many plants, including passion flowers, buckwheat seed, fruits and fruit rinds, and citrus fruits (such as orange, grapefruit, lemon, and lime). Various studies have demonstrated rutin to possess antibacterial, antifungal, antiallergic, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-adipogenic, anti-carcinogenic, anti-apoptotic, anti-osteoporotic, radioprotective, gastroprotective, neuroprotective, and nephroprotective activities. Despite its benefits, rutin's therapeutic applicability is severely limited due to its low water solubility, sensitivity to oxidation, and dissolving rate. However, these problems can be overcome by employing an efficient delivery approach. An extensive number of nanocarriers can be developed for medicinal use if pre-clinical as well as human-clinical studies are completed. The current review presents an overview of effective rutin nano-formulations for targeted therapy in various health disorders. This review article discusses the clinical evidence, current status, as well as future opportunities of rutin nanocarriers for increasing rutin's bioactivity for possible medicinal uses."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3631-8574"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, GLA University, Mathura-281406, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Bansal", "ForeName": "Keshav", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0009-3393-9368"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, GLA University, Mathura-281406, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Bhati", "ForeName": "Hemant", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4574-7223"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, GLA University, Mathura-281406, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Vanshita", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0004-2392-3569"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, GLA University, Mathura-281406, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Pratap", "ForeName": "Uday", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101623431", "ISSNLinking": "2211-7385"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39136519", "10.2174/0122117385308249240723111115", "PNT-EPUB-142233"]}}]}
