Identification of the AMF was made by observation of spore morphology. At least 27 recognized AMF species were identified in samples from field soil, belonging to seven genera of AMF-Acaulospora, Glomus, Funneliformis, Ambispora, Rhizophagus, Pacispora, and Claroideoglomus. Acaulospora and Glomus were the dominant genera, respectively including nine and eight species. A. laevis (90%), R.manihotis (80%), A. brieticulata (75%), A. tuberculata (70%) were the dominant species.Colonization rate was determined,colonization was easily found, but the colonization intensities were low, the colonization rate remained at 10.92%-25.93%. The similarity between provinces is generally low, and the similarity coefficients were from 0.20 to 0.57."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and Ministry of Science and Technology, Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and Ministry of Science and Technology, Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Wen-Li", "Initials": "WL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and Ministry of Science and Technology, Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and Ministry of Science and Technology, Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Rui-Han", "Initials": "RH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and Ministry of Science and Technology, Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hai", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and Ministry of Science and Technology, Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Zhu-Yun", "Initials": "ZY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Genetic Markers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Markers"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Mycorrhizae"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Panax notoginseng"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Selection, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28945027", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20161222.039"]}}]}
