The release kinetics of the developed Mancozeb CR formulations were studied and compared with that of commercially available 42% suspension concentrate and 75% wettable powder. Maximum amount of Mancozeb was released on 42nd day for PEG-600 and octyl chain, PEG-1000 and octyl chain, and PEG-600 and hexadecyl chain, on 35th day for PEG-1000 and hexadecyl chain, on 28th day for PEG-1500 and octyl chain, PEG-2000 and octyl chain, PEG-1500 and hexadecyl chain, and PEG-2000 and hexadecyl chain in comparison to both commercial formulations (15th day). The diffusion exponent (n value) of Mancozeb in water ranged from 0.42 to 0.62 in tested formulations. The half-release (t<sub>1/2</sub>) values ranged from 17.35 to 35.14\u00a0days, and the period of optimum availability of Mancozeb ranged from 18.54 to 35.42\u00a0days. Further, the in vitro bioefficacy evaluation of developed formulations was done against plant pathogenic fungi Alternaria solani and Sclerotium rolfsii by poison food technique. Effective dose for 50% inhibition in mgL<sup>-1</sup> (ED<sub>50</sub>) values of developed formulations varied from 1.31 to 2.79\u00a0mg L<sup>-1</sup> for A. solani, and 1.60 to 3.14\u00a0mg L<sup>-1</sup> for S. rolfsii. The present methodology is simple, economical, and eco-friendly for the development of environment-friendly CR formulations of Mancozeb. These formulations can be used to optimize the release of Mancozeb to achieve disease control for the desired period depending upon the matrix of the polymer used. Importantly, the maximum amount of active ingredient remains available for a reasonable period after application. In addition, the developed CR formulations were found to be suitable for fungicidal applications, allowing use of Mancozeb in lower doses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Agricultural Chemicals, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, ICAR , New Delhi , India."}], "LastName": "Majumder", "ForeName": "Sujan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Agricultural Chemicals, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, ICAR , New Delhi , India."}], "LastName": "Shakil", "ForeName": "Najam A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Directorate of Medicinal & Aromatic Plants Research, ICAR , Anand , Gujarat , India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Jitendra", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Agricultural Chemicals, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, ICAR , New Delhi , India."}], "LastName": "Banerjee", "ForeName": "Tirthankar", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Division of Plant Pathology, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, ICAR , New Delhi India."}], "LastName": "Sinha", "ForeName": "Parimal", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Agricultural Chemicals, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, ICAR , New Delhi , India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Braj B", "Initials": "BB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Agricultural Chemicals, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, ICAR , New Delhi , India."}], "LastName": "Garg", "ForeName": "Parul", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health B", "NlmUniqueID": "7607167", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Delayed-Action Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12427-38-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Maneb"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3WJQ0SDW1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R0HY55EB9E", "NameOfSubstance": "mancozeb"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X1FSB1OZPT", "NameOfSubstance": "Zineb"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Alternaria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Basidiomycota"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delayed-Action Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diffusion"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Maneb"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanocomposites"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Zineb"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27715504", "10.1080/03601234.2016.1211917"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
