Purified norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase had apparent pI 4.7, a native molecular mass of 95 kDa (determined by gel filtration) and subunit molecular mass of 40 kDa (SDS/PAGE). The enzyme did not require a divalent cation for activity, and the addition of Fe2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, or Ni2+ at 5 mM severely inhibited enzyme activity. Neither p-chloromercuribenzoate, N-methylmaleimide nor iodoacetamide inhibited enzyme activity at 1 mM. 5,6-Dihydro-9,10-dimethoxybenzo[g]-1,3-benzodioxolo[5,6-a]qu inolizinium (berberine, the end-product of the biosynthetic pathway in which norcoclurine 6-O-methyltransferase catalyzes an intermediate step) also inhibited the activity by 50% at 10 mM. Norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase methylated both (S)-norcoclaurine and (R)-norcoclaurine and (R,S)-norlaudanosoline. Further characterization of substrate-saturation kinetics and product inhibition of the purified enzyme indicated that norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase follows a bi-bi ping-pong mechanism with Km values of 2.23 mM and 3.95 mM for (R,S)-norlaudanosoline and S-adenosyl-L-methionine, respectively, while Ki values for S-adenosylhomocysteine versus S-adenosyl-L-methionine and (R,S)-norlaudanosoline were 2.1 mM and 0.18 mM, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Japan."}], "LastName": "Sato", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tsujita", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Katagiri", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yoshida", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0107600", "ISSNLinking": "0014-2956"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "91D9GV0Z28", "NameOfSubstance": "Durapatite"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Methyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Durapatite"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7925429", "10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.00125.x"]}}]}
