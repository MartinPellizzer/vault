The coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infectious disease listed as a B infectious disease, which is managed according to standards for A infectious disease. Traditional Chinese medicine and integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine have played an active role in the prevention and control of this epidemic. China's ethnomedicine has recognized infectious diseases since ancient times, and formed a medical system including theory, therapies, formula and herbal medicines for such diseases. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, Tibet Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Chuxiong Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan, Qiandongnan Autonomous Prefecture of Guizhou have issued the prevention and control programs for COVID-19 using Tibetan, Mongolian, Uygur, Yi and Miao medicines. These programs reflect the wisdom of ethnomedicine in preventing and treating diseases, which have successfully extracted prescriptions and preventive measures for the outbreak of the epidemic from their own medical theories and traditional experiences. In this paper, we summarized and explained the prescriptions and medicinal materials of ethnomedicine in these programs, and the origin of Tibetan medicine prescriptions and Mongolian medicine prescriptions in ancient books were studied. These become the common characteristics of medical prevention and treatment programs for ethnomedicine to formulate therapeutic programs under the guidance of traditional medicine theories, recommend prescriptions and prevention and treatment methods with characteristics of ethnomedicine, and focus on the conve-nience and standardization. However, strengthening the support of science and technology and the popularization to the public, and improving the participation of ethnomedicine in national public health services and the capacity-building to deal with sudden and critical diseases are key contents in the development of ethnomedicine in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Minzu University of China Beijing 100081, China Yunnan Province Resources of Development and Collaborative Innovation Center for New Traditional Chinese Medicine Kunming 650051, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhi-Yong", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Traditional Chinese Medicine Development Center of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Tuya"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Branch of Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Jinghong 666100, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hai-Tao", "Initials": "HT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicine Institute of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Urumqi 830002, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Jiang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Normal School,Qinghai Normal University Xining 810008, China."}], "LastName": "Quesheng"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital of Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture Chuxiong 675099, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Guang-Ping", "Initials": "GP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Minzu University of China Beijing 100081, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ming-Shuo", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lijiang Medical Association of Minorities Lijiang 674100, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jian-Qin", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Minzu University of China Beijing 100081, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Xiu-Lan", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Dai Medicine of Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture Jinghong 666100, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Rong", "Initials": "XR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Kazakh Medicine of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Urumqi 830002, China."}], "LastName": "Bolat", "ForeName": "Makabel", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Tibetan Hospital,China Tibetan Studies Center Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Fang-Bo", "Initials": "FB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School Hospital, Minzu University of China Beijing 100081, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Betacoronavirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Coronavirus Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pandemics"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pneumonia, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tibet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19 Drug Treatment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32495579", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200316.408"]}}]}
