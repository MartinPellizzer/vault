The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode and Full MS/dd-MS<sup>2</sup> (data-dependent MS<sup>2</sup>) mode, where selected ions were subjected to a dd-MS<sup>2</sup> scan with given fragmentation energy following a Full MS scan. The application of 70 000 FWHM mass resolution and narrow mass windows (5ppm) effectively improve the selectivity of the method, and a single injection was sufficient to perform the simultaneous screening and identification/quantification of 14 glucocorticoids in 15min. The method validation including selectivity, sensitivity, calibration curve, accuracy, precision, recovery, matrix effect and stability were evaluated. The results of all analytes showed excellent linear relationship while all coefficient of determination (r<sup>2</sup>) were>0.9990 over wide concentration ranges (e.g., 5-1000ng/mL for hydrocortisone butyrate, r<sup>2</sup>=1.0000). The recoveries were in the range of 86.1-102.7%, while the matrix effects ranged from 95.8%-105.8%. Accuracies and precisions were performed. The intra- and inter-day accuracies ranged from 90.6% to 108.9%, while the intra- and inter-day precisions were in the range of 0.5% to 8.5%. Finally, the established method was employed to detect illegal adulterated glucocorticoids in herbal medicines. It will provide more reliable technical basis for the drug quality supervision department and ensure public health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
