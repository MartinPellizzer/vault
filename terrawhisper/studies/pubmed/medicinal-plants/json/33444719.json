Annona muricata L. (Graviola) which is belonging to the Annonaceae family has been traditionally used due to its medicinal abilities including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cancer cell growth inhibition. Graviola is claimed to be a potential antitumor due to its selective cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines. However, the metabolic mechanism information underlying the anticancer activity remains limited.", "This study aimed to investigate the effect of ionic liquid-Graviola fruit pulp extract (IL-GPE) on the metabolomics behavior of colon cancer (HT29) by using an untargeted GC-TOFMS-based metabolic profiling.", "Multivariate data analysis was used to determine the metabolic profiling, and the ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was used to predict the altered canonical pathways after treating the HT29\u00a0cells with crude IL-GPE and Taxol (positive control).", "The principal components analysis (PCA) identified 44 metabolites with the most reliable factor loading, and the cluster analysis (CA) separated three groups of metabolites: metabolites specific to the non-treated HT29\u00a0cells, metabolites specific to the treated HT29\u00a0cells with the crude IL-GPE and metabolites specific to Taxol treatment. Pathway analysis of metabolomic profiles revealed an alteration of many metabolic pathways, including amino acid metabolism, aerobic glycolysis, urea cycle and ketone bodies metabolism that contribute to energy metabolism and cancer cell proliferation.", "The crude IL-GPE can be one of the promising anticancer agents due to its selective inhibition of energy metabolism and cancer cell proliferation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
