The procedure consists of three stages. In the first of these the basic conditions the stationary phase, vapor phase, and individual solvents are selected with a TLC procedure (generally in nonsaturated chromatographic chambers). In the second stage, the optimum combination of the selected solvents is determined with the PRISMA model. The third part of the procedure includes the selection of the development mode (circular, linear, or anticircular); the selection of an appropriate forced-flow chromatographic technique (over-pressured layer chromatography or rotation planar chromatography) with high-performance thin-layer chromatographic plates; the transfer of the optimized mobile phase to the various analytical, planar, or column preparative liquid chromatographic techniques; and the selection of the operating conditions. For practical reasons, the optimization process is presented with the help of flow charts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Medicinal Plants, H-2011 Budakal\u00e1sz, PO Box 11, Hungary."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nyiredy", "ForeName": "Sz", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0173225", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9665"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12515358", "10.1093/chromsci/40.10.553"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
