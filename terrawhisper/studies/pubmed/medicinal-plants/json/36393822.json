The intervention group received <i>B. persicum</i> capsule 60 mg plus <i>F. vulgare</i> capsule 25 mg) twice daily for 4 months and the control groups received routine intervention. Before and after the intervention, levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone, progesterone, prolactin, testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels, hirsutism score, and menstrual pattern were recorded and endometrial thickness and follicle count were determined by ultrasound. Data were analyzed by the SPSS21 software.", "Treatment with <i>B. persicum</i> and <i>F. vulgare</i> extracts significantly decreased LH and DHEAS levels, hirsutism score, and significantly increased menstrual duration compared to the control group. Before the intervention, 5.7% of the intervention and control groups had the normal menstrual pattern, while after the intervention 31.4% of the intervention group and 25.7% of the control group had the normal pattern.", "Regarding the effect of these extracts combination and because they have no side-effects, which is a great advantage over chemical drugs, using of these plants recommend."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2022 Advanced Biomedical Research."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Community-Oriented Nursing Midwifery Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aliakbari", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Reproductive Health Research Center, School of Medicine, Al-zahra Hospital, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran."}], "LastName": "Naghdipour Mirsadeghi", "ForeName": "Misa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, School of Medicine, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hashemi", "ForeName": "Elmira", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Plants Research Centre, Basic Health Sciences Institute, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rahimi-Madiseh", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, School of Medicine, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammadi", "ForeName": "Belgheis", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Adv Biomed Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101586897", "ISSNLinking": "2277-9175"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Azziz R, Carmina E, Chen Z, Dunaif A, Laven JS, Legro RS, et al.
