Some key factors influencing the electrostatic field induced spray ionization (EFISI)-MS for a variety of natural compounds have been optimized and improved. Fifteen reference substances representing ten well-known skeletons of natural products including alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, lignans, coumarins, anthraquinones, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids and triterpenoids, were selected and investigated for their EFISI-MS<sup>n</sup> responses on TLC plates using a dot-blot test. The optimized ionization conditions for these compounds in the positive ion mode were achieved, together with their limits of detection. In addition, to avoid the limitation of some compounds being difficultly ionized in the positive ion mode, the negative ion mode of the TLC-EFISI-MS method was developed and optimized for the first time. By coupling with a TLC bioautographic assay, nine lipase inhibitory components in American ginseng (Panax quinquefolium roots) have been successfully identified/ tentatively identified in situ by their EFISI-MS<sup>n</sup> data and further confirmed by comparisons of their R<sub>f</sub> values and MS<sup>n</sup> data with those of reference substances. These lipase inhibitory compounds were 24(S)-pseudo-ginsenoside F<sub>11</sub>, ginsenosides R<sub>g1</sub>, R<sub>e</sub>, XVII, R<sub>c</sub>, R<sub>b2</sub>/R<sub>b3</sub>, R<sub>b1</sub>, R<sub>o</sub> and malonyl-ginsenoside R<sub>b1</sub>. This is the first report that the TLC-EFISI-MS<sup>n</sup> method is adapted to a broad-spectrum analysis of structural skeletons present in herbal medicines."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
