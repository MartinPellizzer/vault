Isolated chloroplast envelopes from young pea or spinach are capable of binding the majority of proteins obtained by translation of poly(A)-containing RNA from greening plants in vitro. Among the bound proteins the precursors to the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b apoprotein and the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase are prominent. Binding is an intrinsic property of the envelope membrane and does not require energy in the form of ATP. Bound proteins remain on the surface of the envelope vesicles and can be digested by protease. Binding is complete within minutes, shows a high affinity of the reactants, and is non-ionic in nature. Protein binding is specific for translation products of poly(A)-containing RNA from greening plants. Precursors to chloroplast protein are bound preferentially as compared to the mature proteins. The specificity is further demonstrated by the low binding of proteins obtained by run-off translation of polysomes. Binding of radioactive labeled proteins is subject to competition by excess unlabeled homologous proteins. Once bound, the proteins are withdrawn from competition indicating a high binding stability. All the properties found for binding of proteins to isolated envelopes are consistent with the concept of the so-called envelope carrier hypothesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pfisterer", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lachmann", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kloppstech", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0107600", "ISSNLinking": "0014-2956"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "24937-83-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Poly A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "63231-63-0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding, Competitive"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Poly A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Binding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Biosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6181990", "10.1111/j.1432-1033.1982.tb06758.x"]}}]}
