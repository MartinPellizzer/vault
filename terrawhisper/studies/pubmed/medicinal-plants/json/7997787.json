He established a specific association with the tree species Eucalyptus camaldulensis and E. tereticornis. Based on his findings, ELLIS proposed that the fungus could be exported from Australia to others regions, including Colombia, by means of infected seeds. The purpose of this study was to isolate and identify Cryptococcus sp., associated with Eucalyptus trees; this is the first ecological evaluation of C. neoformans var. gattii in our country. A total of 100 Eucalyptus trees, distributed among 13 zones, located in the center, northeast, east and west of Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1, were studied. Flowers, fruits, leaves, barks and Eucalyptus debris were collected. The samples were processed by extraction with saline solution containing antibiotics, cultured in selective media and the isolates were identified by morphological and biochemical character\u00edstics. Twenty-seven isolates of 9 Cryptococcus sp. were recovered from 21 Eucalyptus trees, from 5 zones. One C. neoformans var. neoformans serotype A was recovered. The Cryptococcus associated with Eucalyptus is important because this is the first study done in our country."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto Nacional de Salud, Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1, Colombia."}], "LastName": "Duarte", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ordo\u00f1ez", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Casta\u00f1eda", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Asociaci\u00f3n de levaduras del genero Cryptococcus con especies de Eucalyptus en Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Rev Inst Med Trop Sao Paulo", "NlmUniqueID": "7507484", "ISSNLinking": "0036-4665"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agglutination Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colombia"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "isolation & purification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cryptococcus neoformans"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Eucalyptus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7997787"]}}]}
