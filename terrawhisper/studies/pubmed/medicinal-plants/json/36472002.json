Hd-zip \u2163 is thought to play an important role in trichome development of Schizonepeta tenuifolia. This study aims to explore the functions of StHD1 and StHD8 in Hd-zip \u2163 subfamily in peltate glandular trichome development. To be specific, the expression patterns of the two genes and interaction between the proteins encoded by them were analyzed based on transcriptome sequencing and two-hybrid screening. The subcellular localization was performed and functions of the genes were verified in tobacco and S. tenuifolia. The results showed that StHD1 and StHD8 had high similarity to HD-Zip \u2163 proteins of other plants and they all had the characteristic conserved domains of HD-Zip \u2163 subfamily. They were located in the nucleus. The two genes mainly expressed in young tissues and spikes, and StHD1 and StHD8 proteins interacted with each other. The density and length of glandular trichomes increased significantly in tobacco plants with the overexpression of StHD1 and StHD8. Inhibiting the expression of StHD1 and StHD8 by VIGS(virus-induced gene silencing) in S. tenuifolia resulted in the reduction in the density of peltate glandular trichomes, the expression of key genes related to mono-terpene synthesis, and the relative content of limonene and pulegone, the main components of monoterpene. These results suggested that StHD1 and StHD8 of S. tenuifolia formed a complex to regulate glandular trichomes and affect the biosynthesis of monoterpenes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Pei-Na", "Initials": "PN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Dang", "ForeName": "Jing-Jie", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Yong-Fang", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Zun-Rui", "Initials": "ZR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chan-Chan", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization Nanjing 210023, China National and Local Collaborative Engineering Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization and Formulae Innovative Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Qi-Nan", "Initials": "QN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trichomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "33"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36472002", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220810.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
