The present experiment examined both protein synthesis in the skin and muscle and wool growth in Merino lambs differing in live weight, intake and dietary protein source. The experiment was a 2(3) factorial design: twenty-four 5-month-old lambs initially weighing 33 kg (heavy) or 25 kg (light) were fed on a hay-based diet with either lupin seed or rapeseed meal as the major protein sources to maintain live weight (M) for 56 d, or were fed at 0.6 M for 28 d (period 1) followed by 28 d at 1.6 M (period 2). Fractional protein synthesis rates (FSR, % per d) in the skin and the m. longissimus dorsi on days 4 and 24 of period 1 and day 4 of period 2 were measured by means of a flooding dose of L-[ring-d5]phenylalanine, and wool growth on a skin patch over period 1 was also measured. The FSR ranged from 13.2 to 20.2% per d in the skin, higher than reported for other breeds, and 1.53-3.07% per d in the muscle. Sheep on the low intake (0.6 M) had significant reductions in FSR, protein content (g), protein synthesis (g/d) in the skin, and wool growth (g/d). The heavy lambs had similar FSR to the light lambs, but had a higher skin protein content and total protein synthesis per unit of skin area (100 cm2) and, therefore, grew more wool. The rapeseed-meal diet increased FSR and wool growth only in the light lambs over the short term. The protein deposited in wool over period 1 was 0.185 of the total protein synthesis in the skin, regardless of live weight, intake or diet, a result similar to other breeds. With the changes in dietary intake, protein synthesis in the skin and muscle responded differentially, with nutrient partitioning at sub-maintenance in favour of wool growth but at supra-maintenance, following a nutrient restriction, in favour of weight gain in young growing sheep."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIRO Division of Animal Production, Wembley, Australia. sliu@ccmar.csiro.au"}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mata", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "O'Donoghue", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Masters", "ForeName": "D G", "Initials": "DG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0372547", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Muscle Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brassica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Skeletal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Wool"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9577305", "10.1079/bjn19980044", "S0007114598000452"]}}]}
