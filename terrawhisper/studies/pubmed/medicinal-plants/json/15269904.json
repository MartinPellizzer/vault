Toxicological studies using leeches became restricted when their natural sources decreased dramatically. We breed medicinal leeches under laboratory conditions and have the possibility of using them for various investigations. The aim of the current study was to investigate changes in behavioral and physiological responses of leeches exposed to a heavy metal model mixture (HMMM). The composition of the HMMM was determined on the basis of the average annual amounts of representative metals (Zn, Mn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Cd, and Pb) in wastewater discharging from the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. An annual average was considered a concentration of 1%. Animals were exposed to 0.13%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2% concentrations of the HMMM. The avoidance responses, changes in body weight, feeding behavior, and excretion rates of the leeches were recorded. Avoidance response was observed in animals treated with 1% and 2% concentrations of the HMMM during the first 2 h of exposure. A decrease in body weight was recorded after a 4-week exposure to all tested concentrations. Disturbances in feeding behavior were observed after a 4-week exposure to 0.13%-2% concentrations. An increase in the defecation rate was observed during the 5-week exposure to 0.25%-2% concentrations. The excretion rate via nephridia was decreased during postfeeding period after exposure to 0.25%-2% concentrations. The avoidance response of medicinal leeches can be used as an express method for water quality assessment, whereas physiological responses may be used for the assessment of chronic toxicity of polluted environments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Ecology of Vilnius University, Akademijos 2, Vilnius LT-2600, Lithuania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Petrauskiene", "ForeName": "Laima", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "100885357", "ISSNLinking": "1520-4081"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Avoidance Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Defecation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Feeding Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Leeches"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lithuania"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Power Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15269904", "10.1002/tox.20039"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
