Here, we have developed an ultra-selective turn-on fluorescent probe based on an aptamer and Chitosan-CD nanocomposite. The CD used in this study were synthesized using Quercus cap extract and a microwave-assisted approach. The Chitosan-CD nanocomposite was optimized using several microscopic and spectroscopic techniques to possess a bright fluorescence emission before adding aptamer and totally quenched fluorescence after addition of aptamer. The designed probe was proficient in the detection and quantification Leishmania infantum parasite by selective targeting of poly(A) binding protein (PABP) on the surface of the parasite. The designed fluorescent biosensor with high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, and a limit of detection (LOD) of 94 cells/mL of the Leishmania infantum parasite as well as a linear response in the ranges of 188-750 cells/mL and 3000-6000 cells/mL (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.98 for both linear ranges). Additionally, the selectivity of the designed probe was evaluated in the presence of different pathogenic species such as Trypanosoma brucei parasite and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, as well as LiIF2\u03b1 and LiP2a and BSA proteins as interference substances. The results of this study shows that using Chitosan-CD nanocomposite is a great strategy for developing selective turn-on probes with extraordinary accuracy and sensitivity in identifying Leishmania infantum parasite, especially in the early stages of the disease, and it is promising for the future clinical applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
