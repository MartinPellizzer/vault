Aerial parts of three Ephedra species were separated into internodes and extracted using Finger Masher with minimum loss. The contents of EP and PEP were measured by LC/MS/MS using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method. Their contents in old-year branches were lower than those current-year branches and tended to be higher in the middle part than in the tip of each branch. The content ratio of EP and PEP was reversed in some branches depending on their extent of growth. In E. sinica, the contents were low at the first internode closest to the central main stem at each branch. The contents drastically increased from the second internode and were highest at the third internode. There was a strong correlation between the internode distance and alkaloid (EP\u2009+\u2009PEP) contents. The distribution of alkaloids in one internode was examined and the results showed that the part closest to the node had the lowest contents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6302-4507"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Medicinal Plant Resources, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, 1-2 Hachimandai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0843, Japan. fuchino@nibiohn.go.jp."}], "LastName": "Fuchino", "ForeName": "Hiroyuki", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Medicinal Plant Resources, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, 1-2 Hachimandai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0843, Japan."}], "LastName": "Iida", "ForeName": "Osamu", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Medicinal Plant Resources, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, 1-2 Hachimandai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0843, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kawano", "ForeName": "Noriaki", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Medicinal Plant Resources, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, 1-2 Hachimandai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0843, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kawahara", "ForeName": "Nobuo", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Medicinal Plant Resources, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, 1-2 Hachimandai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0843, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yoshimatsu", "ForeName": "Kayo", "Initials": "K"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "15ak0101034h0001 (2015)", "Agency": "The Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "16ak0101034h0002 (2016)", "Agency": "The Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "17ak0101034h0003 (2017)", "Agency": "The Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Letter"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101518405", "ISSNLinking": "1340-3443"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7CUC9DDI9F", "NameOfSubstance": "Pseudoephedrine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GN83C131XS", "NameOfSubstance": "Ephedrine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Ephedra"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ephedrine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudoephedrine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Miyagoshi M, Amagaya S, Ogihara Y (1986) Antitussive effects of L-ephedrine, amygdalin, and Makyokansekito (Chinese traditional medicine) using a cough model induced by sulfur dioxide gas in mice.
