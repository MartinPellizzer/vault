The clinical methodology, preparation of extracts and execution of the skin tests were identical to those described in the previous study (14). Patients with sensitivity to Frullania and Compositae were submitted to standard skin tests as shown in table II. These patients were also tested with a 0.1% preparation of Helenin in vaseline. The eleven cases of sensitization to Allium sativum L (garlic) corresponded to women whose primary or secondary profession was that of a housewife. In each case, the reaction was in the form of pulpitis, typically affecting the thumbs, left middle and index fingers and right thumb, which are those that have the greatest contact with the garlic bulb. Primula obconica Hance was responsible for the sensitization of 7 women and 1 man. In two of the patients, the positive test result was unrelated to the clinical picture for which the patients sought medical attention. In one of the two cases, the patient had had prolonged, previous contact with Primula but without reaction. In the other case, the origin of the reaction could not be established. The contact dermatitis produced by Primula are located principally in the face and hands.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fern\u00e1ndez de Corres", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Leanizbarrutia", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mu\u00f1oz", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Corrales", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Dermatitis al\u00e9rgica de contacto por ajo, pr\u00edmula, frullania y compuestas."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Allergol Immunopathol (Madr)", "NlmUniqueID": "0370073", "ISSNLinking": "0301-0546"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "580KA9SG8W", "NameOfSubstance": "primin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis, Contact"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Facial Dermatoses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hand Dermatoses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lactones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Occupations"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Quinones"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4083225"]}}]}
