Molecular and chemical analysis was performed for ithe dentification/differentiation of mutant genotype. <b>Materials and methods:</b> Chamomile (<i>Chamomilla recutita</i> [L.] Rauschert) variety Vallary seeds were irradiated by applying <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mo>\u03b3</mo></math> -rays irradiation at 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 and1000\u2009Gy doses at a dose rate of 55\u2009Gy/min and mutants were isolated and analyzed for the quantity and quality of essential oil. The oil was found to be rich in acetylenic compound (2<i>Z</i>,8Z)-matricaria acid methyl ester and the results obtained were validated using gas chromatography (GC) coupled with either Flame Ionization detection (GC-FID) or mass spectrometer (GC-MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). <b>Results:</b> The selected mutant SELM-1 (Selection Mutant-1) showed the production potential of 7.00-7.50\u2009q ha<sup>-1</sup> dry flowers and 6.00-6.50\u2009kg ha<sup>-1</sup> essential oil yield. Essential oil of mutant SELM-1 contained in [(2<i>Z</i>,8<i>Z</i>)-matricaria acid methyl ester] (76-80%) useful in cosmetic, perfumery, and pharmaceutical industries. <b>Conclusion:</b><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mo>\u03b3</mo></math> -rays irradiation method is a very efficient mutation breeding method for chamomile crop. GC-FID or GC-MS and NMR methods are found to be the most powerful methods for screening of essential oil chemical compounds isolated from the mutants. The novel mutant (SELM-1) is very promising in terms of high flower and essential oil yield rich in acetylenic compound (2<i>Z</i>,8<i>Z</i>)-matricaria acid methyl ester (76-80%), hence, it was released as variety in Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR)-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plant (CIMAP), Lucknow U.P.
