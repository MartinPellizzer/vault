Although the plant is reported to have some important pharmacological effects, many medicinal values remain unidentified. Our objective was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory, anti-diarrheal, thrombolytic, and cytotoxic properties of the methanol extract of P. orientalis leaves (Po-MeOH).", "Anti-inflammatory activity was measured by the inhibition of hypotonicity-induced human red blood cell hemolysis and albumin denaturation technique in vitro of Po-MeOH. Diarrheal episodes were examined in mice with castor oil-induced diarrhea. The clot lysis and brine shrimp lethality bioassay in vitro were used to evaluate the thrombolytic and cytotoxic activities of the plant extract, respectively.", "Using in vitro anti-inflammatory models, the results demonstrated that Po-MeOH at the five different dose ranges from 31.25 to 500 \u03bcg/mL significantly (p<0.05) protected (0.98%-50.71%) the erythrocyte membrane against lysis induced by hypotonic medium solution and protein denaturation (38.27%-79.22%) of bovine albumin, respectively. The extract exhibited a significant reduction of severity (75.17%) of castor oil-induced diarrhea in mice at the highest dose of 400 mg/kg compared to loperamide (82.06%) at 5 mg/kg. Po-MeOH also showed 33.14% clot lytic activity in the thrombolytic test and cytotoxicity with LC50 value 58.91 \u03bcg/mL in the brine shrimp bioassay.", "These findings suggest that Po-MeOH has significant anti-inflammatory and anti-diarrheal effects along with moderate thrombolytic and lower cytotoxic properties that may warrant the further exploration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ansari", "ForeName": "Prawej", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Uddin", "ForeName": "Md Josim", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "Md Masudur", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abdullah-Al-Mamun", "ForeName": "Md", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Islam", "ForeName": "Md Rabiul", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Md Hazrat", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Reza", "ForeName": "A S M Ali", "Initials": "AS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9101750", "ISSNLinking": "0792-6855"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidiarrheals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fibrinolytic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antidiarrheals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cytotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Fibrinolytic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polygonaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27487493", "10.1515/jbcpp-2016-0023", "/j/jbcpp.ahead-of-print/jbcpp-2016-0023/jbcpp-2016-0023.xml"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
