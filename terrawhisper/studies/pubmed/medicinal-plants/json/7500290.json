Material comprised fibroblasts from fibrous bands situated in the buccal mucosa and from the inner aspect of the forearm of 8 patients with classic features of OSF as well as fibroblasts from 6 buccal mucosa and 8 skin biopsy specimens from healthy non-areca nut chewing individuals. Cells were cultured for 8 days according to standard techniques. Their growth was monitored daily, under optimal conditions as well as exposure to concentrations of arecoline. The data were analyzed using regression analysis, analysis of variance and the Kruskal-Wallis test. We found no statistically significant differences between the proliferation patterns of oral and skin fibroblasts from patients or between those from patients and controls. The reaction of the cells exposed to concentrations of arecoline was similar; at low concentrations (0.1-10 micrograms/ml) normal growth was maintained, while 100 micrograms/ml inhibited growth. It is concluded that fibroblasts from mouths affected by OSF have proliferation patterns which fall within normal parameters, that the excessive collagen formation in established OSF is not due to increased fibroblast proliferation and that arecoline does not stimulate fibroblast proliferation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oral and Dental Research Institute, University of Stellenbosch, South Africa."}], "LastName": "van Wyk", "ForeName": "C W", "Initials": "CW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Olivier", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hoal-van Helden", "ForeName": "E G", "Initials": "EG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grobler-Rabie", "ForeName": "A F", "Initials": "AF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "J Oral Pathol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8911934", "ISSNLinking": "0904-2512"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Muscarinic Agonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nicotinic Agonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4ALN5933BH", "NameOfSubstance": "Arecoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Arecoline"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forearm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscarinic Agonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotinic Agonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Oral Submucous Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7500290", "10.1111/j.1600-0714.1995.tb01198.x"]}}]}
