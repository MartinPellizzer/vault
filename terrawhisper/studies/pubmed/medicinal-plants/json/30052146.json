The oils were analyzed for physicochemical properties using standard procedures, phytochemicals and FAs contents using gas chromatography-fluorescent ionization detection, and free radical-scavenging potentials using spectrophotometric methods of determination.", "The bagasse and residue oils contained lower moisture contents (1.13%-2.38%) and acid values (1.89-9.20\u2009mg/KOH/g), while the GH oil produced the least refractive indices, saponification value, and oil yield. CA oil contained 78% saturated FA, while SB oils contained 73.65% saturated FA and an abundance of lignoceric, palmitoleic, oleic, and arachidic acid. CC oil contained mostly behenic acid (19.65%), and GH oil produced 87.04% saturated FA, while TB oil produced 56% unsaturated FA. Oils from SJ, CS, PP, PM, and CG contained between 48.34% and 57.09% unsaturated FA. The phytochemical composition showed that ribalinidine and sapogenin were most abundant in PM oil, while lunamarine, kaempferol, and catechin were most abundant in SJ oil. GH oil produced the highest amounts of phytate (53.81\u2009\u00b5g/ml) and oxalate (39.47\u2009\u00b5g/ml). TB oil and oils from SJ and CS, especially at higher concentrations, matched the scavenging potentials of the standards used.", "Due to the thermal stability and amount of short chain fatty acids (SFAs) of the SB, CA, CC, and GH oils, they are more suitable for non-food industrial purposes, while TB, SJ, and CS oil properties are recommendable for therapeutic purposes, especially for relief of oxidative stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Biochemistry , Imo State University Owerri , Owerri , Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Nnabugwu", "ForeName": "Agomuo Emmanuel", "Initials": "AE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Biochemistry , University of Port Harcourt , Choba , Rivers State , Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Uchenna", "ForeName": "Amadi Peter", "Initials": "AP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Coll Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8215879", "ISSNLinking": "0731-5724"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Agrochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9004-34-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Cellulose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9006-97-7", "NameOfSubstance": "bagasse"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Agrochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cellulose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nutrients"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30052146", "10.1080/07315724.2018.1484307"]}}]}
