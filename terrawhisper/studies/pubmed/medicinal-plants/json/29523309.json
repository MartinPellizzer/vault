Therefore, this study was launched to discover a novel antituberculosis agent from wild Egyptian Sahara plants. Twelve such plants were screened, in vitro, for their activity against various Mycobacterium species. The most active plant, Euphorbia paralias, was further fractionated with different organic solvents, and the activity of the obtained fractions was determined by the agar diffusion and broth microdilution methods. The methanol fraction was the most active against Mycobacterium spp., and was non-toxic in doses up to 10\u00a0g/kg of animal weight. Its main component was separated by column chromatography, and then identified by ultraviolet spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis as quercetin-3-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside. Docking analysis suggested that quercetin-3-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside inhibits the glutamine synthetase enzyme, a promising target for the development of antituberculosis drugs. This prediction was confirmed by an in vitro glutamine synthetase biosynthetic assay. To the best of our knowledge, and based on bioinformatics mining of the BioPhytMol database, this is the first report on the antimycobacterial activity of Euphorbia paralias plant. It is also the first report on the inhibition of mycobacterial glutamine synthetase by the flavonoid quercetin."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017.
