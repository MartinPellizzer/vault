However, there are significant differences in the content of active compounds in Chinese medicinal materials, which mainly due to origin, picking seasons, and processing methods. Hence, the accurate content of the glycosides is the prerequisite for ensuring the pharmacological efficacy. Aiming at establishing an efficient extraction and determination method for accurate quantitative analysis of calycosin-7-glucoside, liquiritin and glycyrrhizic acid in Huangqi Liuyi Decoction, an on line solid-phase extraction-high-performance liquid chromatography method was developed, using a homemade bio-based monolithic adsorbent. The bio-based adsorbent was prepared in a stainless steel tube, using bio-monomers of methyleugenol and S-allyl-L-cysteine, which effectively reduced the dependence of the polymer field on non-renewable fossil resources and reduced carbon emissions. Furthermore, the prepared adsorbent owned abundant chemical groups, which can produce interactions of hydrogen bond, dipole-dipole, \u03c0-\u03c0 and hydrophobic force with the target glycosides, thus improving the specific recognition ability of the adsorbent. The experiments were carried out on an LC-3000 HPLC instrument with a six-way valve. Methodology validation indicates that the recovery is in the range of 97.0%-103.4% with the RSD in the range of 1.6%-4.0%, due to the specific selectivity of the bio-based monolithic adsorbent for these three glycosides, and good matrix-removal ability for Huangqi Liuyi decoction. The limit of detection is 0.17, 0.50 and 0.33\u00a0\u03bcg/mL for calycosin-7-glucoside, liquiritin and glycyrrhizic acid, respectively, and the limit of quantitation is 0.50, 1.50 and 1.00\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively, with the linear range of 2-200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL for calycosin-7-glucoside, and 5-500\u00a0\u03bcg/mL for liquiritin and glycyrrhizic acid.
