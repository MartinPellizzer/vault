They have been used as herbal drugs and sources of novel bioactive compounds. They provide a wide array of chemical compounds, many of which can not be synthesized via current synthesis methods. Natural products may provide aromatase inhibitory activity through various pathways and may act clinically effective for treating pathologies associated with excessive aromatase secretion, including breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, endometriosis, uterine fibroid, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer, infertility, and gynecomastia. Recent studies have shown that natural products with aromatase inhibitory activity can also be good options against secondary recurrence of breast cancer by exhibiting chemopreventive effects. Therefore, screening for new plant-based aromatase inhibitors may provide novel leads for drug discovery and development, particularly with increased clinical efficacy and decreased side effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Gazi University, 06330, Etiler, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ak\u00e7a", "ForeName": "Kevser Taban", "Initials": "KT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Pharmaceutical Sciences, Laboratory Animals Breeding and Experimental Research Center, Gazi University, Faculty of Pharmacy, 06330, Etiler, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Demirel", "ForeName": "Murside Ay\u015fe", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Gazi University, 06330, Etiler, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "S\u00fcntar", "ForeName": "Ipek", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aromatase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hormones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Aromatase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Aromatase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Aromatase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hormones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Prostatic Hyperplasia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "35"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34844542", "10.2174/1568026621666211129141631", "CTMC-EPUB-119128"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
