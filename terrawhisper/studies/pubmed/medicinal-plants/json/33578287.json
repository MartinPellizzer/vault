Two PGPR strains, Bacillus sp. WM13-24 and Pseudomonas sp. M30-35, were previously isolated from the rhizosphere of H. ammodendron in Tengger Desert, Gansu province, northwest China. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of M30-35 and WM13-24 in drought stress alleviation of ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Under normal condition, both M30-35 and WM13-24 increased shoot fresh and dry weight, chlorophyll content, total nitrogen and phosphorus contents and altered phytohormone distribution compared to control. Moreover, after 7 days of drought stress, WM13-24 and M30-35 enhanced photosynthetic capacity, relative water content, the activities of catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) and proline content, resulted in decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, relative membrane permeability (RMP) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation; interestingly, the two strains decreased ABA content in leaves. This study demonstrated that the two PGPR strains promoted ryegrass growth and root development via regulating plant hormone distribution and enhanced drought tolerance of ryegrass through improving the activities of antioxidant enzymes, regulating ABA signaling and maintaining plant growth. Our results indicated that PGPR strains from rhizosphere of the desert plant species could be considered as promising bioinoculants for grass plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.
