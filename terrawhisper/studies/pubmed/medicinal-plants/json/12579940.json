Leaves were extracted with ethanol and analytes were extracted with hexane after addition of acid/salt solution and adsorbent to matrix solution. Ginkgolic acids were separated and determined within 30 minutes by RP-AHPLC under optimum chromatographic conditions. Methanol and 5% aqueous acetic acid (90:10) containing 0.03 mol.L-1 silver ion was used as mobile phase, column temperature was selected at 30 degrees C, flow rate was 1.0 mL.min-1, UV detection wavelength was at 310 nm. The spectra analysis and purity identification of chromatographic peaks of ginkgolic acids were further confirmed by means of diode array detection.", "Four ginkgolic acids were baseline separated from each other and from other interfering components. The average recovery and relative standard deviation of the method were 97.3% and 1.6%, respectively.", "RP-AHPLC was an excellent method for separation of homologous with different carbon atom numbers and double bond.
