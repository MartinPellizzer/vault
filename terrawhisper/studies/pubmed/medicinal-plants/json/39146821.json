In rats, sub-chronic administration of ketamine is used for the induction of schizophrenia model. Increased locomotor activity is one of the most important features of psychotic-like symptoms in rodents. On the other hand, risperidone is a potent antipsychotic medication that is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In the present research, we aimed to investigate the effect of sub-chronic treatment of ketamine on cognitive and behavioral functions, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression level in the prefrontal cortex. Also, we assessed the efficacy of risperidone on cognitive and behavioral impairments induced by ketamine. Possible sex differences were also measured. Ketamine was intraperitoneally injected at the dose of 30\u00a0mg/kg for five consecutive days. Risperidone was also intraperitoneally injected at the dose of 2\u00a0mg/kg. Novel object recognition memory, pain threshold, locomotor activity, rearing behavior, and BDNF level were evaluated. The results showed that ketamine injection for five consecutive days impaired the acquisition of long-term recognition memory and decreased BDNF level in the prefrontal cortex in both sexes. Also, it decreased pain threshold in females, increased rearing behavior in males, and induced hyperlocomotion with greater effect in females. On the other hand, risperidone restored or attenuated the effect of ketamine on all the behavioral effects and BDNF level. In conclusion, we suggested that there were sex differences in the effects of ketamine on pain perception, locomotion, and rearing behavior in a rat model of schizophrenia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
