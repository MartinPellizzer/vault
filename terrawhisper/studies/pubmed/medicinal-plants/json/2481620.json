However, favism is a unique natural model of oxidant damage in vivo, useful for the study of senescent or damaged red blood cells (RBC) clearance from circulation. The following aspects have been considered: 1. Pathophysiology of favism, including incidence, salient features, and sequence of events. 2. RBC alterations during the haemolytic crisis: biochemical, rheological and morphological alterations occurring in RBC isolated at different stages of the crisis. 3. Toxic substances of Vicia faba and their mechanism of action: treatment of G6PD-deficient RBC with divicine or isouramil (redox substances present in fava beans) provokes the same changes as observed during favism. 4. Intravascular vs. extravascular haemolysis: extravascular (i.e. phagocytic) removal of damages RBC seems predominant in favism. 5. The signal for RBC removal: in analogy with a recent model for recognition and removal of oxidant-stressed or senescent RBC, we propose removal of fava bean damaged RBC be mediated by apposition of antiband 3 antibodies and complement C3 fragments, recognized as non-self recognition signal by monocytes and macrophages."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Biology and Medical Chemistry, University of Torino Medical School."}], "LastName": "Arese", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mannuzzu", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Turrini", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Folia Haematol Int Mag Klin Morphol Blutforsch", "NlmUniqueID": "0374615", "ISSNLinking": "0323-4347"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Aging"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Favism"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hemolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "22"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2481620"]}}]}
