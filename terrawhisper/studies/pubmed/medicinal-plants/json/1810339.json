Two cases are described here, in which both external morphological and internal karyological features, are correlated. These data have been obtained through biometric and karyotypic studies, carried out both on the perennials V. onobrychioides and V. altissima, and on the annuals V. villosa ssp. varia and V. benghalensis. In both perennials the chromosomes were rather long, the nucleolar constriction was on the longest couple of chromosomes, and even the satellite was of the same type; in both annuals the chromosomes were short, the nucleolar constriction was on the shortest couple of chromosomes, and the satellite was large in comparison to the arm to which it was connected. These similarities of the karyotypes are important because they may make easier a possible experimental cross-breed of the abovementioned entities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Istituto Botanico Hanbury dell'Universit\u00e0 di Genova."}], "LastName": "Roti-Michelozzi", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Forno", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Convergenza e divergenza fra morfologia e cariologia in specie affini del genere Vicia."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Boll Soc Ital Biol Sper", "NlmUniqueID": "7506962", "ISSNLinking": "0037-8771"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Chromosomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1810339"]}}]}
