Monoclonal antibodies against the bioactive compounds contained in the crude drugs were prepared and set up the ELISA as a high sensitive and quick determination method. A newly developed eastern blotting methodology can stain typically the only antigen molecule and the related compounds having a same aglycone. Knockout extract can be prepared by using an immunoaffinity column conjugated with monoclonal antibody, and its importance has been discussed. Single chain fragment-variable gene against solamargine was cloned and transformed to a host plant, Solanum chasianum resulting in the increase of antigen molecule as 2.5 to 3 times. Three biosynthetic enzymes regarding marihuana compounds, THCA-, CBDA-, CBCA-synthases were isolated. THCAsynthase was cloned, over expressed and confirmed its characteristics including FAD combining enzyme, and finally determined the structure by X-ray analysis. The distribution of THCAsynthase was also investigated using its and GFP hybrid gene. We found new functions for saffron like improving learning and memory and LTP for blocking by ethanol. A folk medicine in Taiwan, Anoectochilus formosanus was propagated in vitro and investigated opening new pharmacological activities in lipid metabolism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan. shoyama@niu.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shoyama", "ForeName": "Yukihiro", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin Variable Region"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Affinity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoblotting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin Variable Region"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacognosy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "92"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17917420", "10.1248/yakushi.127.1593", "JST.JSTAGE/yakushi/127.1593"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
