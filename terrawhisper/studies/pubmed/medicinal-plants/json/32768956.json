Once infected with these two viruses, it will cause life-long latency in the host, and the continuous recurrence of the infection will seriously affect the quality of life. Moreover, infections with HSV-1 and HSV-2 have been reported to make the body susceptible to other diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and HIV. Thus, more attention should be paid to the development of novel anti-HSV drugs. Polysaccharides obtained from medicinal plants and microorganism (both land and sea) are reported to be promising anti-herpes substances. However, their antiviral mechanisms are complex and diverse, which includes direct inhibition of virus life cycle (Adsorption, penetration, genetic material and protein synthesis) and indirectly through improving the body's immunity. And each step of the research processes from extraction to structural analysis contributes to the result in terms of antiviral activity. Therefore, The complex mechanisms involved in the treatment of Herpes simplex infections makes development of new antiviral compounds is difficult. In this paper, the mechanisms of polysaccharides in the treatment of Herpes simplex infections, the research processes of polysaccharides and their potential clinical applications were reviewed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
