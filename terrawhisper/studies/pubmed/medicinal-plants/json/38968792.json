Additionally, CA treatment reduced core body temperature, enhanced survival time, and mitigated liver tissue damage. Furthermore, CA treatment also reduced the activities of AST and ALT enzymes in the serum samples of HS mice. Molecular docking analysis of the 28 overlapping targets between HS and CA revealed that CA has strong binding affinities for the top 15 targets. These targets are primarily involved in nine major signaling pathways, with the JAK-STAT pathway being highly associated with the other eight pathways. Our findings also indicate that CA treatment significantly downregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines both in vivo and in vitro while upregulating the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, CA treatment reduced the levels of JAK2, phospho-STAT5, and phospho-STAT3 both in vivo and in vitro, which is consistent with its inhibition of the apoptotic markers p53, Bcl2, and Bax.", "Heat stroke-induced liver injury was inhibited by CA through the downregulation of JAK/STAT signaling."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier GmbH.
