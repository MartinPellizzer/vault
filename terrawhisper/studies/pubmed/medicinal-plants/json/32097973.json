Natural compounds from medicinal plants have attracted considerable attention for their use in the prevention and treatment of neurological disorders. 11-Keto-<i>\u03b2</i>-boswellic acid, a triterpenoid found in the medicinal plant <i>Boswellia serrata</i>, has neuroprotective potential. The present study investigated the effect of 11-keto-<i>\u03b2</i>-boswellic acid on glutamate release <i>in vitro</i> and kainic acid-induced glutamate excitotoxicity <i>in vivo</i> in the rat hippocampus. In rat hippocampal nerve terminals (synaptosomes), 11-keto-<i>\u03b2</i>-boswellic acid dose-dependently inhibited 4-aminopyridine-stimulated glutamate release. This effect was dependent on extracellular calcium, persisted in the presence of the glutamate transporter inhibitor DL-threo-<i>\u03b2</i>-benzyloxyaspartate, and was blocked by the vesicular transporter inhibitor bafilomycin A1. In addition, 11-keto-<i>\u03b2</i>-boswellic acid reduced the 4-aminopyridine-induced increase in intrasynaptosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. The N- and P/Q-type channel blocker <i>\u03c9</i>-conotoxin MVIIC and the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 significantly suppressed the 11-keto-<i>\u03b2</i>-boswellic acid-mediated inhibition of glutamate release, whereas the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-releasing inhibitors dantrolene, CGP37157, and xestospongin C, mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor PD98059, as well as protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C had no effect. In a rat model of excitotoxicity induced by intraperitoneal kainic acid injection (15\u2009mg/kg), intraperitoneal 11-keto-<i>\u03b2</i>-boswellic acid administration (10 or 50\u2009mg/kg) 30\u2009min before kainic acid injection considerably ameliorated kainic acid-induced glutamate concentration elevation and CA3 neuronal death. These data suggested that 11-keto-<i>\u03b2</i>-boswellic acid inhibits glutamate release from the rat hippocampal synaptosomes by suppressing N- and P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and protein kinase A activity, as well as exerts protective effects against kainic acid-induced excitotoxicity <i>in vivo</i>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Far-Eastern Memorial Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Cheng Wei", "Initials": "CW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Far-Eastern Memorial Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Tzu Yu", "Initials": "TY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Chinese Herbal Medicine, College of Human Ecology, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan City, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Su Jane", "Initials": "SJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "the Ministry of Science and Technology Taiwan", "Agency": "MOST 107-2314-B-418-005; MOST 106-2320-B-030-002", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "11-keto-boswellic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3KX376GY7L", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutamic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SIV03811UC", "NameOfSubstance": "Kainic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cerebral Cortex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glutamic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hippocampus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kainic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32097973", "10.1055/a-1107-9337"]}}]}
