Immediately after the announcement, we conducted drug consultation for outpatients prescribed the medicines potentially interacting with SJW. We provided information concerning possible drug interaction with SJW for 741 outpatients (except for pediatrics) during the period of May 22-June 16, 2000. The potential drugs prescribed frequently were warfarin (28.0%), theophylline (19.7%), digitalis (18.4%), carbamazepine (7.2%), disopyramide (6.9%) and cyclosporin (6.3%). Of the patients, 401 subjects were surveyed by collecting the questionnaires to clarify the background of SJW drug interaction. Twenty-two subjects (5.5%) have known commercially available SJW products, 5 subjects (1.2%) have ever taken SJW products before and 2 subjects (0.5%) have taken SJW products concomitant with prescribed medicines. Gender difference was observed in paying attention to SJW products; female subjects (8.6%) tended to have more interest in SJW products than male subjects (2.8%). Two subjects taking SJW have realized for the first time that the supplements they took were SJW products when their package photographs were shown at the consultation. Showing the package photographs might be helpful for making the patients easy to identify the SJW products, because most patients do not pay attention to whether the supplements contain SJW or not. It is recommended that drug consultation should be provided to avoid serious drug interaction with SJW while the outpatients are taking potential medicines prescribed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1, Ten-nodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Homma", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takeda", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamamoto", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suga", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horiuchi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Satoh", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kohda", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Prescriptions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Outpatients"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Referral and Consultation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Self Medication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11193392", "10.1248/yakushi1947.120.12_1435"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
