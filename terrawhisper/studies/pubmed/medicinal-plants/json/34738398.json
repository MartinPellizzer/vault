The HPLC analysis was performed on a Kromasil 100 C_8 column(4.6 mm\u00d7250 mm, 5 \u03bcm) with acetonitrile(A)-0.1% formic acid in water(B) as mobile phase in a gradient elution mode. Besides, the flow rate was set at 1 mL\u00b7min~(-1) and the column temperature was 35 \u2103. The detection wavelength was set at 255 nm and the injection volume was 10 \u03bcL. Seventeen batches of \u2033Bangga\u2033 samples were analyzed and the HPLC fingerprint was established under the above conditions. Similarity evaluation was performed using Similarity Evaluation System for Chromatographic Fingerprint of Traditional Chinese Medicine(2012). As a result, 16 common peaks were selec-ted and the similarity values of 17 batches of \u2033Bangga\u2033 were in the range of 0.702-0.966. Furthermore, one batch of A. tanguticum and one batch of A. naviculare were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and 74 common compounds were inferred, including 10 phenolic acids, 26 flavonoids, and 38 alkaloids. The established method, with good separation and strong specificity, is simple and feasible, and can be used for the quality control of \u2033Bangga\u2033 and identification of its two original plants. A. tanguticum and A. naviculare are similar in chemical composition and component content, but are quite different in the content of flavonoids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Quality Control Technology of Chinese Herbal Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Chen-Na", "Initials": "CN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Quality Control Technology of Chinese Herbal Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100053, China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Si-Yu", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Quality Control Technology of Chinese Herbal Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Wei-Hong", "Initials": "WH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Quality Control Technology of Chinese Herbal Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Yao-Hua", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Quality Control Technology of Chinese Herbal Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Qian", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Quality Control Technology of Chinese Herbal Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhi-Min", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Quality Control Technology of Chinese Herbal Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chun", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tibet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "9"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34738398", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210702.202"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
