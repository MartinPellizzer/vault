The enzyme is a key target in cancer chemotherapy and has been purified from Lactobacillus leichmannii. Cytotoxicity studies showed that both PGL and TPD are potently toxic and inhibited the growth of L. leichmannii cells (IC(50)=45 and 40 microM, respectively). Both the alkaloids significantly inhibited DHFR activity (IC(50)=40 and 32 microM for PGL and TPD, respectively). Alkaloid concentrations greater than 75-95 microM resulted in a complete loss of DHFR activity. Our results are suggestive of the alkaloids as potential antimicrobial and antitumour compounds. Alkaloid binding to DHFR is slow and reversible. Inhibition kinetics revealed K(i) values of 9x10(-6) M and 7x10(-6) M for PGL and TPD, respectively for the enzyme and inhibition in both the cases was a simple linear 'non-competitive' type."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Radiation Biology and Biochemistry Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Trombay, India. rbbd@magnum.barct1.ernet.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "K N", "Initials": "KN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Venkatachalam", "ForeName": "S R", "Initials": "SR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol In Vitro", "NlmUniqueID": "8712158", "ISSNLinking": "0887-2333"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Folic Acid Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoquinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "32523-69-6", "NameOfSubstance": "tylophorinidine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "571-70-0", "NameOfSubstance": "pergularinine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.5.1.3", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Folic Acid Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Isoquinolines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lactobacillus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10699361", "10.1016/s0887-2333(99)00092-2", "S0887-2333(99)00092-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
