The LOX isozymes in green beans extract had a different heat sensitivity but a similar pressure stability: two fractions following apparent first-order reactions, i.e., a heat-labile fraction and a heat-stable fraction, were observed in studies on its thermostability, whereas only one fraction following a first-order reaction was noticed in studies on its pressure stability. At ambient pressure, irreversible LOX inactivation was studied in a temperature range from 55 to 70 degrees C. At room temperature, pressures around 500 MPa were required in order to inactivate LOX in green beans extract. The effect of a pressure or a thermal pretreatment on LOX thermo- or barostability, respectively, was also investigated but no significant differences in inactivation kinetics due to the pretreatment were observed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Food Technology, Department of Food and Microbial Technology, Catholic University of Leuven, Kardinaal Mercierlaan 92, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Indrawati", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van Loey", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ludikhuyze", "ForeName": "L R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hendrickx", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Prog", "NlmUniqueID": "8506292", "ISSNLinking": "1520-6033"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.13.11.12", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoxygenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Beverages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Stability"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoxygenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10194404", "10.1021/bp990007o", "bp990007o"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
