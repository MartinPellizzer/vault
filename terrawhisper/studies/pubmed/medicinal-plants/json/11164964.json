In T. yunnanensis cell cultures, the lanthanum ion at concentrations from 1.15 to 23.0 microM stimulated taxol production. The lanthanum ion also promoted taxol excretion by the T. yunnanensis cells considerably. The maximum stimulation of taxol production was achieved by the addition of 5.8 microM La3+ to the culture during mid-log growth phase, increasing the volumetric taxol yield by nearly threefold, from 2.61+/-0.37 to 9.89+/-1.92 mg l(-1) over a 28 day culture period. At higher concentrations, i.e. 23.1 and 46.2 microM, however, the lanthanum ion caused significant growth inhibition. For the other three Taxus cell lines, namely an embryo and a leave cell of T. chinensis and a stem cell of T. chinensis marv, the addition of lanthanum ion to the culture only had a significant effect on taxol production by the T. chinensis marv stem cells, increasing the volumetric yield by about threefold to 4.69+/-0.76 mg l(-1). These results suggest that lanthanum has elicitor-like effects on secondary metabolite synthesis of plant cell cultures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong. bcjywu@polyu.edu.hk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mei", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8411927", "ISSNLinking": "0168-1656"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Growth Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6I3K30563S", "NameOfSubstance": "Lanthanum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P88XT4IS4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Paclitaxel"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Growth Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lanthanum"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Paclitaxel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Taxus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11164964", "10.1016/s0168-1656(00)00383-7", "S0168-1656(00)00383-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
