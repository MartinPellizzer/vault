We have previously shown that kamebakaurin and other three kaurane diterpenes selectively inhibit activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB, a central mediator of apoptosis and immune responses. We here demonstrate that kamebakaurin is a potent inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation by directly targeting DNA-binding activity of p50. Kamebakaurin prevented the activation of NF-kappaB by different stimuli in various cell types. Kamebakaurin did not prevent either stimuli-induced degradation of IkappaB-alpha or nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, however, it significantly interfered DNA binding activity of activated NF-kappaB in cell and in vitro and preferentially prevented p50-mediated DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB rather than that of RelA as measured using in vitro translated p50 and RelA proteins. Moreover, a p50 mutant with a Cys-62 --> Ser mutation was not inhibited with kamebakaurin, indicating that the effect of kamebakaurin was probably due to its interaction with cysteine 62 in p50. The covalent modification of p50 by kamebakaurin was further demonstrated by mass spectrometry analysis that showed an increase in the molecular mass of kamebakaurin-treated p50, and this modification was not reverted by addition of dithiothreitol. These results suggested that kamebakaurin exhibited its inhibitory activity by a direct covalent modification of cysteine 62 in the p50. Also, treatment of cells with kamebakaurin prevented the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced expression of antiapoptotic NF-kappaB target genes encoding c-IAP1 (hiap-2) and c-IAP2 (hiap-1), members of the inhibitor of apoptosis family, and Bfl-1/A1, a prosurvival Bcl-2 homologue, and augmented the TNF-alpha-induced caspase 8 activity, thereby resulting in sensitizing MCF-7 cells to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. Taken together, kamebakaurin is a valuable candidate for the intervention of NF-kappaB-dependent pathological conditions such as inflammation and cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anticancer Research Laboratory, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, P.
