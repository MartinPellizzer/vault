Initiation of CAM was associated with being a member of an ethnic minority group and a higher level of education. Initiation of nonherbal CAM was associated with being married, while use of herbal CAM therapies was significantly associated with choosing observation. Herbal use before diagnosis was associated with being white, higher level of education and being single. Prostate specific antigen at diagnosis, Gleason score, quality of life, participant perceptions of seriousness of prostate cancer or self-reported worry about prostate cancer were not related to initiation or prior use. Of those men reporting current use almost 50% did not inform their treating physician of using CAM therapies.", "Initiation of CAM therapies as a result of a prostate cancer diagnosis was fairly low, although two-thirds of men had used it before diagnosis. Half of the patients did not inform their physicians about such use and physicians should continue to probe patients about CAM use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Population Science, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Cheltenham, PA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Diefenbach", "ForeName": "Michael A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hamrick", "ForeName": "Natalie", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Uzzo", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pollack", "ForeName": "Alan", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horwitz", "ForeName": "Eric", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Greenberg", "ForeName": "Richard", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Engstrom", "ForeName": "Paul F", "Initials": "PF"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA 6136-04", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Urol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376374", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5347"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brachytherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Educational Status"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiotherapy", "surgery", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Prostatic Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12796672", "10.1097/01.ju.0000070963.12496.cc", "S0022-5347(05)63460-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
