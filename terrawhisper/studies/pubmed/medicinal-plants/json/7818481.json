Leaves were supplied with air containing 14CO2 in the light then the plants were transferred to normal air in the light or in the dark. Leaf samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to a powder and extracted with acid. Lipids, pigments and cations were removed from the extract and CA1P and 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol (CA) recovered by anion exchange chromatography. The CA1P was further purified by its specific binding to purified ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. CA and CA1P were identified by chromatographic properties and n.m.r. spectra. When plants were kept for 15 h in darkness after exposure to 14CO2, up to 2.2% and 5.5% of the radioactivity in the extracts was present in CA1P and CA, respectively. The most radioactivity appeared in these compounds when photosynthesis from 14CO2 took place at low photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Under such conditions, radioactivity was detected in CA1P after only 10 min. During subsequent exposure to normal air (12CO2) at low PPFD the amount of radioactivity in CA1P remained almost constant for 6 h; in darkness the rate of incorporation of radioactivity into CA1P reached a maximum after 2 h and the radioactivity was still increasing 6 h later. At low PPFD, the amount of CA1P in the leaves reached a maximum after 2 h. In darkness, the amount of CA1P began to increase rapidly after a lag of almost 1 h, well ahead of the increase in radioactivity in CA1P."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Arable Crops Research, Rothamsted Experimental Station, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, U.K."}], "LastName": "Andralojc", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dawson", "ForeName": "G W", "Initials": "GW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Parry", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Keys", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biochem J", "NlmUniqueID": "2984726R", "ISSNLinking": "0264-6021"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "2-carboxyarabinitol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentosephosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sugar Alcohols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "106777-19-9", "NameOfSubstance": "2-carboxyarabinitol 1-phosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pentosephosphates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sugar Alcohols"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1983 Nov;73(3):729-34", "ArticleIdList": ["16663291"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1991 May;96(1):208-13", "ArticleIdList": ["16668153"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1992 Aug;99(4):1551-5", "ArticleIdList": ["16669073"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1989 Jun;90(2):679-85", "ArticleIdList": ["16666827"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem J. 1967 Sep;104(3):922-33", "ArticleIdList": ["6049932"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1989 Jun;90(2):673-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16666826"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Feb;84(3):734-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16593807"]}, {"Citation": "Biochemistry. 1966 Jul;5(7):2350-7", "ArticleIdList": ["5959458"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem J. 1992 Nov 1;287 ( Pt 3):821-5", "ArticleIdList": ["1332682"]}, {"Citation": "FEBS Lett. 1971 Mar 16;13(4):229-234", "ArticleIdList": ["11945674"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1989 Jan;89(1):174-9", "ArticleIdList": ["16666511"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1992 Aug;99(4):1546-50", "ArticleIdList": ["16669072"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7818481", "PMC1137402", "10.1042/bj3040781"]}}]}
