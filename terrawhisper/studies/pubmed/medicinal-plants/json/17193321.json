The results indicate significant trends in cytotoxic activity relative to collection location, taxonomy, plant part, and compound classes isolated. Plant collections were made in tropical forests in six countries, with collections from Ecuador resulting in higher activity than those from Indonesia and Peru. Interestingly, collections from Florida were not statistically different than those from the countries with higher biodiversity. One hundred and forty-five families were represented in the collections, with the Clusiaceae, Elaeocarpaceae, Meliaceae, and Rubiaceae having low ED50 (half maximal effective dose) values. Especially active genera included Aglaia, Casearia, Exostema, Mallotus, and Trichosanthes. Roots and below-ground plant materials were significantly more active than above-ground materials. Cucurbitacins, flavaglines, anthraquinones, fatty acids, tropane alkaloids, lignans, and sesquiterpenoids were significantly more active than xanthones and oligorhamnosides. The results from this study should serve as a guide for future plant collection endeavors for anticancer drug discovery."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Program for Collaborative Research in the Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago, 833 South Wood Street (M/C 781), Chicago, IL 60612, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balunas", "ForeName": "Marcy J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "William P", "Initials": "WP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chin", "ForeName": "Young-Won", "Initials": "YW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mi", "ForeName": "Qiuwen", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Farnsworth", "ForeName": "Norman R", "Initials": "NR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soejarto", "ForeName": "Djaja D", "Initials": "DD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cordell", "ForeName": "Geoffrey A", "Initials": "GA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Swanson", "ForeName": "Steven M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pezzuto", "ForeName": "John M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chai", "ForeName": "Hee-Byung", "Initials": "HB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kinghorn", "ForeName": "A Douglas", "Initials": "AD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "U01/U19 CA52956", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biodivers", "NlmUniqueID": "101197449", "ISSNLinking": "1612-1872"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17193321", "10.1002/cbdv.200690092"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
