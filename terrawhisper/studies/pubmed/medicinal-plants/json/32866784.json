RalA is a Ras-like GTPase, which play pivotal roles in the biology of cells. So far, there have been very few studies on RalA regulating inflammatory responses. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that RalA might participate in the regulatory network of NLRP3 inflammasome, which has been confirmed in THP-1 macrophages. After virtual screening of compounds, it was found that levonidazole selected from our virtual small molecule compound library has the potential to bind to RalA. Of note, the interaction of RalA/levornidazole was verified by Surface Plasmon Resonance-Biacore T200, LC/MS analysis and Western blotting analysis. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the conformational changes of RalA might be regulated by levornidazole. Additionally, IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 secretion from ATP\u00a0+\u00a0LPS stimulated THP-1-derived macrophages was RalA-dependently suppressed by levornidazole, suggesting that RalA might have an inhibitory effect on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The results of co-immunoprecipitation and RalA depletion experiments showed that levornidazole could induce RalA to block the assembly of NLRP3/ASC/pro-caspase-1 complex, thereby reducing the levels of cleaved-caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 secretion. Our study has suggested an anti-inflammatory function of RalA and identified its targeting chemical compound. Overall, this study clarifies a novel pharmacological mechanism by which RalA/levornidazole inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 secretion."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
