The effect of soy on scopolamine-induced spatial learning and memory in comparison to the effect of estradiol was investigated. Materials and methods Ovariectomized rats were divided into the following groups: (1) control, (2) scopolamine (Sco), (3) scopolamine-soy 20 (Sco-S 20), (4) scopolamine-soy 60 (Sco-S 60), (5) scopolamine-estradiol 20 (Sco-E 20) and (6) scopolamine-estradiol 60 (Sco-E 60). Soy extract, estradiol and vehicle were administered daily for 6 weeks before training in the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Scopolamine (2 mg/kg) was injected 30 min before training in the MWM test. Results In the MWM, the escape latency and traveled path to find the platform in the Sco group was prolonged compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Treatment by higher doses of soy improved performances of the rats in the MWM (p < 0.05 - p < 0.001). However, treatment with both doses of estradiol (20 and 60 \u03bcg/kg) resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the MWM (p < 0.01 - p < 0.001). Cortical, hippocampal and serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), as an index of lipid peroxidation, were increased which was prevented by soy extract and estradiol (p < 0.001). Cortical, hippocampal as well as serum levels of the total thiol, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in Sco group were lower than the control group (p < 0.001) while they were enhanced when the animals were treated by soy extract and estradiol (p < 0.01 - p < 0.001). Conclusions It was observed that both soy extract and estradiol prevented learning and memory impairments induced by scopolamine in ovariectomized rats. These effects can be attributed to their protective effects on oxidative damage of the brain tissue."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Marefati", "ForeName": "Narges", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mokhtari-Zaer", "ForeName": "Amin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Science and Neuroscience Research Center, Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran."}], "LastName": "Beheshti", "ForeName": "Farimah", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Karimi", "ForeName": "Sareh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahdian", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Substance Abuse Prevention Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khodamoradi", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center and Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Azadi Square, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran, Phone: +98-51-38828565, Fax: +98-51-38828564."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Horm Mol Biol Clin Investig", "NlmUniqueID": "101538885", "ISSNLinking": "1868-1883"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4TI98Z838E", "NameOfSubstance": "Estradiol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DL48G20X8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Scopolamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Estradiol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maze Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Memory"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Memory Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ovariectomy"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Scopolamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spatial Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31483756", "10.1515/hmbci-2018-0084", "/j/hmbci.ahead-of-print/hmbci-2018-0084/hmbci-2018-0084.xml"]}}]}
