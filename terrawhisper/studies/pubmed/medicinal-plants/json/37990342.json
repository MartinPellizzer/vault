However, therapeutic efficacies and biosafety have never been compared to these compounds. This study aimed to determine the optimal retinoid type(s) for anti-photoaging therapy both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Our data demonstrated that four retinoids (RPalm, RP, HPR and ROL) but not RAc were effective for anti-photoaging treatment at 5\u2009\u03bcg/mL in\u00a0vitro, with action mechanisms associated with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-skin ECM degradation activities. Notably, both RPalm and RP appeared superior to HPR and ROL for those activities. Importantly, both RPalm and RP were shown to be optimal for anti-photoaging therapy when topically applied at 5\u2009mg/kg in a UVB-induced mice model of photoaging, which is consistent with their high anti-photoaging activities in\u00a0vitro. Additionally, topical application of these five retinoids showed satisfactory biosafety without causing significant apoptosis in animal organs, although RP application led to a slight decline in animal body weights. Collectively, these data have laid a good foundation for the next development of the clinical application of these retinoids for skin healthcare."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 American Society for Photobiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, CAS Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xing Jiang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "HBN Research Institute and Biological Laboratory, Shenzhen Hujia Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, Guangdong, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Shu", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0008-8469-1473"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "HBN Research Institute and Biological Laboratory, Shenzhen Hujia Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Menggeng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Zhengqiang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan Allan Conney Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Foshan, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Guangdong Second People's Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Ju", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, CAS Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xing Jiang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Aisa", "ForeName": "Haji Akber", "Initials": "HA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, CAS Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xing Jiang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Zhiyun", "Initials": "Z"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2021CG0029", "Agency": "Department of Science and Technology of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2022B1111080003", "Agency": "Guangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "22178070", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Comparative Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Retinoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Retinoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Han M, Li H, Ke D, et\u00a0al.
