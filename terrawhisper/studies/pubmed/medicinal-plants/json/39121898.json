Bucidarasin A, a natural diterpenoid, has been shown to exert notable cytotoxic effects across a range of tumor cell lines. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this cytotoxicity remain unclear. In this study, we sought to elucidate the antitumor mechanisms of bucidarasin A, a natural diterpenoid derived from Casearia graveolens, with a particular focus on its effects on HCC. Furthermore, we employed surface plasmon resonance (SPR), molecular docking, and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) to gain further insight into the target protein of bucidarasin A. Our findings revealed that bucidarasin A exhibited pronounced cytotoxicity towards HepG2 cells. In vitro analysis indicated that bucidarasin A interrupted the cell cycle at the S phase and inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of HepG2 cells by modulating the FAK and STAT3 signaling pathways. Moreover, in vivo studies demonstrated that bucidarasin A not only exhibited antitumor effects but also impeded neovascularization, a finding that was corroborated by SPR interactions between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bucidarasin A. This research substantiated that bucidarasin A, a clerodane diterpenoid, held promise as a therapeutic candidate against HCC, showcasing substantial antitumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo through direct targeting of the STAT3 and FAK signaling pathways."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
