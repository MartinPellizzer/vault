The present investigation aimed for validation of promising plants traditionally used to alleviate menopausal symptoms with ER\u03b2 mediated MAO-A inhibition potential through <i>in silico</i> disease-target network construction using Cytoscape plugins followed by molecular docking of phytomolecules through AutoDock vina. ADMET parameters of identified bioactive phytomolecules were analysed through swissADME and ProTox II. The efficacy of promising plant leads was further established through <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> ER\u03b2 competitive binding, MAO-A inhibition, enzyme kinetics and free radical quenching assays. <i>In silico</i> analysis suggested glabrene (\u0394G = -9.7\u2009Kcal/mol) as most promising against ER\u03b2 in comparison to 17\u03b2-estradiol (\u0394G = -11.4\u2009Kcal/mol) whereas liquiritigenin (\u0394G = -9.4\u2009Kcal/mol) showed potential binding with MAO-A in comparison to standard harmine (\u0394G = -8.8\u2009Kcal/mol). <i>In vitro</i> analysis of promising plants segregated <i>Glycyrrhiza glabra</i> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.052\u2009\u00b1\u20090.007\u2009\u03bcg/ml) as most promising, followed by <i>Hypericum perforatum</i> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.084\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u2009\u03bcg/ml), <i>Trifolium pratense</i> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.514\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u2009\u03bcg/ml) and <i>Rumex nepalensis</i> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.568\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11\u2009\u03bcg/ml). The enzyme kinetics of promising plant leads showed reversible and competitive nature of inhibition against MAO-A. The potency of plant extracts in quenching free radicals was at par with ascorbic acid. The identified four potent medicinal plants with ER\u03b2 selective, MAO-A inhibitory and free radical quenching abilities could be used against menopausal symptoms however, finding needs to be validated further for menopausal symptoms in <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> conditions for drug development.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
