A substantial number of approximately 8500 recorded compounds containing a furan ring exist which have been analytically or in biologically studied. A significant portion of these compounds is found in the everyday environments of individuals, particularly when ingested through food. Consequently, there is a need for a universal approach to rapidly predict the potential toxicity trends of FCPs. In this study, we developed a bromine labeling-based platform that combines LC-ICP-MS and LC-ESI-MS techniques to absolutely quantify FCP-induced protein adduction. The LC-ESI-MS approach facilitated the identification of FCP-derived protein adducts and optimized liquid chromatographic conditions for analyte separation. By employing a well-designed bromine-containing compound as a general internal standard, LC-ICP-MS-based technique enabled to absolutely assess bromine-labeled protein adduction. The protein adduction efficiencies of furan, 2-methylfuran, and 2,5-dimethylfuran were found to be 2.68, 2.90, and 0.37 molecules per 10,000 FCP molecules that primary hepatocytes received, respectively. Furthermore, we observed that 2-methylfuran exhibited the highest cytotoxicity, followed by furan and 2,5-dimethylfuran, which aligned with the order of their protein adduction. Thus, the protein adduction efficiency of FCPs could serve as a potential index for predicting their toxicity trends."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
