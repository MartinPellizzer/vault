A polysaccharide (SWP) was isolated from the sweet potato tuber and elucidation of its structure as composed of rhamnose, glucose, and galactose undertaken. To improve its activity, selenylation of this novel polysaccharide (Se-SWP) was undertaken by using microwave synthesis. In vitro evaluation showed that the Se-SWP has excellent antioxidant activity on scavenging free radicals and reducing capacity. In vivo antitumor evaluation showed selenylation polysaccharide could effectively inhibit tumor growth (>50%) and adjust immune factor levels in the mice (IL-2, TNF-\u03b1, and VEGF). The antidiabetic potential of Se-SWP was tested in STZ-induced diabetic rats. The results indicated that the Se-SWP treatment significantly reduced the levels of malondialdehyde and other disadvantageous factors that were increased by the STZ treatment. Meanwhile, the Se-SWP treatment caused a significant increase in the activities of enzymatic antioxidants and the levels of nonenzymatic antioxidants in the organs of diabetic rats. All of the activity evaluations indicated that the selenylation method could improve the activity of sweet potato polysaccharide and its efficacy as a potential therapeutic, which will be the focus of further study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4437-5368"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province & School of Life Science, Jiangsu Normal University , Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221116, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province & School of Life Science, Jiangsu Normal University , Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221116, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xu-Qin", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province & School of Life Science, Jiangsu Normal University , Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221116, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Xuzhou Sweetpotato Research Center , Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221131, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Kou", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "He Fei First People Hospital , He fei, An-Hui 230000, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Chang-Yan", "Initials": "CY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biomedical Sciences, Xuzhou Medical University , Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuan-Yuan", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province & School of Life Science, Jiangsu Normal University , Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221116, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province & School of Life Science, Jiangsu Normal University , Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221116, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Xuzhou Sweetpotato Research Center , Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221131, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province & School of Life Science, Jiangsu Normal University , Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221116, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Ji-Hong", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H6241UJ22B", "NameOfSubstance": "Selenium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ipomoea batatas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Selenium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28052202", "10.1021/acs.jafc.6b04788"]}}]}
