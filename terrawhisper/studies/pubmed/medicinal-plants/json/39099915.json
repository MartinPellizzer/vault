Among the plethora of medicinal plants, <i>Croton bonplandianum</i>, commonly known as \"Ban Tulsi,\" holds significant medicinal value owing to its diverse pharmacological properties. This study investigated the cytotoxicity, embryotoxicity, antidiabetic, and anticariogenic effects of an ethanolic extract derived from <i>C. bonplandianum</i>.\u00a0The research objectives were to explore the preparation of an ethanolic extract of <i>C. bonplandianum</i> and employ a multifaceted approach by evaluating its cytotoxicity, embryotoxicity, anticariogenic, and antidiabetic potentials. Materials and methods In this study, the \u03b2-glucosidase inhibitory and the \u03b1-amylase inhibitory assays were utilized to evaluate the antidiabetic activity of the\u00a0<i>C. bonplandianum</i> ethanolic extract. The in vitro cytotoxicity activity was assessed by using the brine shrimp lethality assay (BSLA), and embryotoxicity was evaluated using zebrafish embryos and larvae. Through the agar well diffusion method and the time-kill curve analysis, the anticariogenic activity was evaluated. Results In \u03b1-amylase and\u00a0\u03b2-glucosidase inhibitory assays, the ethanolic extract of\u00a0<i>C. bonplandianum</i> showed potent antidiabetic properties, near those of\u00a0standard acarbose. The cytotoxicity evaluation using the BSLA showed less toxicity. The anticariogenic activity of the ethanolic extract of <i>C. bonplandianum</i>\u00a0was assessed by comparing the standard (Amoxyrite) in terms of its zone of inhibition against oral pathogens such as\u00a0<i>Streptococcus mutans</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> species (spp.). The antibacterial efficiency was validated using a time-kill curve assay in which the study depends on the concentration of the bacterial pathogenic organisms, namely, <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. and <i>S. mutans</i>. In embryotoxicity evaluation, there were no morphological malformations in zebrafish larvae or embryos when exposed to high concentrations of <i>C. bonplandianum</i> ethanolic extract. Conclusion The ethanolic extract of<i>\u00a0C. bonplandianum</i> exhibited promising antidiabetic and anticariogenic effects, supporting its conventional usage in\u00a0alternative medicine. The outcomes of these research analyses suggest the plant\u00a0potential as a natural source of compounds with bioactive qualities and can be utilized in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Kumar G et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanobiomedicine Lab, Centre for Global Health Research, Saveetha Medical College and Hospital, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Chennai, IND."}], "LastName": "Kumar G", "ForeName": "Vignesh", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanobiomedicine Lab, Centre for Global Health Research, Saveetha Medical College and Hospital, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Chennai, IND."}], "LastName": "Shanmugam", "ForeName": "Rajeshkumar", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanobiomedicine Lab, Centre for Global Health Research, Saveetha Medical College and Hospital, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Chennai, IND."}], "LastName": "Deenadayalan", "ForeName": "Pavithra", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanobiomedicine Lab, Centre for Global Health Research, Saveetha Medical College and Hospital, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Chennai, IND."}], "LastName": "Manigandan", "ForeName": "Pradeep", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "Human subjects: All authors have confirmed that this study did not involve human participants or tissue.
