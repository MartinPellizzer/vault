Also, to obtain relevant data on the antioxidant capacity, two different assays, (2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging and ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) assays were used.", "The extraction efficiency of phenolics, as well as the antioxidant capacity of plant extracts, was affected by both prolonged extraction and hydrolysis. The overall highest content of phenolic compounds was determined in hydrolyzed extract of blackberry leaves (2160\u2009mg GAE/L), followed by the non-hydrolyzed extract of lemon balm obtained after 15\u2009min of extraction (929.33\u2009mg GAE/L). The above extracts also exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity, while extracts of olive leaves were characterized with the lowest content of phenolic compounds, as well as the lowest antioxidant capacity. The highest content of rosmarinic acid, as the most abundant phenolic compound, was determined in non-hydrolyzed extract of lemon balm, obtained after 15\u2009min of extraction. Although the hydrolysis provided the highest content of polyphenolic compounds, longer extraction time (15\u2009min) was more efficient to extract these bioactives than shorter extraction duration (5\u2009min).", "The distribution of detected phenolic compounds showed a wide variability with regard to their botanical origin.
