Despite individual studies, there is also no clear statistics on the SSI prevalence rate in the East Mediterranean region. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of SSI in the Eastern Mediterranean region. <b>Methods:</b> This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by searching three international databases (Web of Science, PubMed and Scopus) from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2018. The keywords used included 'Prevalence' OR 'incidence' OR 'surgical site infection' OR 'wound infection' OR 'Postoperative Wound Infections' and 'Middle east'. The Hoy et\u00a0al.'s tool was used to evaluate the quality of the articles. <b>Result:</b> Out of 889 initial studies, 40 studies from 12 countries of the Eastern Mediterranean region were included in the final stage of the study. Based on the results of random effect method, the overall prevalence of SSI in 137,452 patients was 7.9% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 7.1, 8.8; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=96.7%). The prevalence of SSI in cardiac surgery and general surgery wards was 10 and 9.2%, respectively. The prevalence of SSI was lower in women than in males, although this difference was related to caesarean section. <b>Conclusions:</b> Considering the high prevalence of SSI in the Eastern Mediterranean region, timely diagnosis, proper prevention and postoperative control are necessary in the region using the same international guides in all countries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Clinical Immunology Research Center, Ali-Ebne Abitaleb Hospital, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences , Zahedan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Maleknejad", "ForeName": "Abdulbaset", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery, Jiroft University of Medical Sciences , Jiroft , Iran."}], "LastName": "Dastyar", "ForeName": "Neda", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Zabol University of Medical Sciences , Zabol , Iran."}], "LastName": "Badakhsh", "ForeName": "Mahin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Nursing and Midwifery School, Iran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Balouchi", "ForeName": "Abbas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Student Research Committee, School of Public Health and Safety, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Rafiemanesh", "ForeName": "Hosein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Nursing, Sultan Qaboos University , Muscat , Oman."}], "LastName": "Al Rawajfah", "ForeName": "Omar", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9417-3997"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zabol Medicinal Plants Research Center, Zabol University of Medical Sciences , Zabol , Iran."}], "LastName": "Rezaie Keikhaie", "ForeName": "Khadije", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bushehr University of Medical Sciences , Bushehr , Iran."}], "LastName": "Sheyback", "ForeName": "Mahmood", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Infect Dis (Lond)", "NlmUniqueID": "101650235", "ISSNLinking": "2374-4243"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cross Infection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Longitudinal Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mediterranean Region"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Surgical Wound Infection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31361182", "10.1080/23744235.2019.1642513"]}}]}
