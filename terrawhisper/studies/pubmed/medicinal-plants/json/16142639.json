However, the mechanism underlying its effects is unknown. This study investigated the effects of alpha-hederin on the regulation of MT expression in an in vitro model using the murine hepatoma cell line, Hepa-1c1c7, and the murine macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. Alpha-hederin that was added directly to Hepa-1c1c7 cells had no effect on MT induction. However, MT and its mRNA levels increased markedly when the Hepa-1c1c7 cells were cultured with the alpha-hederin-treated, conditioned medium from the RAW 264.7 cells. Co-treating the RAW 264.7 cells with alpha-hederin and pentoxifylline, a TNF-alpha synthesis inhibitor, resulted in decreased effects of alpha-hederin on MT induction. In the alpha-hederin-exposed RAW 264.7 cell cultures, production and mRNA levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were increased. Accordingly, it was found that the MT induction activity was inhibited when antibodies to TNF-alpha and/or IL-6 were added to the alpha-hederin-treated, conditioned medium from the RAW 264.7 cells. These results suggest that the upregulation of MT expression by alpha-hederin is mediated by TNF-alpha and IL-6."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Chosun University, Kwangju, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Ji Young", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Chul Yung", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jeong", "ForeName": "Hye Gwang", "Initials": "HG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-hederin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SMK8R7TGJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9038-94-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Metallothionein"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-6"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Metallothionein"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16142639", "10.1055/s-2005-864185"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
