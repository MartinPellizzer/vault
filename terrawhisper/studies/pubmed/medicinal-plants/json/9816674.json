The inducibility of cyclase enzyme activities paralleled the absolute amount of cyclase protein(s) of pepper immunodetected by monoclonal antibodies raised against tobacco sesquiterpene cyclase. A cDNA library was constructed with poly(A)+ RNA isolated from 24 h UV-challenged leaves of pepper. A cDNA clone for sesquiterpene cyclase in pepper was isolated by using a tobacco 5-epi aristolochene synthase gene as a heterologous probe. The predicted protein encoded by this cDNA was comprised of 559 amino acids and had a relative molecular mass of 65,095. The primary structural information from the cDNA clone revealed that it shared 77%, 72% and 49% identity with 5-epi aristolochene, vetispiradiene, and cadinene synthase, respectively. The enzymatic product catalyzed by the cDNA clone in bacteria was identified as 5-epi aristolochene, as judged by argentation TLC. RNA blot hybridization demonstrated the induction of an mRNA consistent with the induction of cyclase enzyme activity in UV-treated pepper."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetic Engineering, Chonnam National University, Kwangju, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Back", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "K U", "Initials": "KU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "D H", "Initials": "DH"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["AF061285"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9430925", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0781"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1O869T5P54", "NameOfSubstance": "capsidiol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon-Carbon Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.2.3.6", "NameOfSubstance": "trichodiene synthetase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon-Carbon Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Alignment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9816674", "10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029452"]}}]}
