In this study, the leaf and stem extracts from AO were assessed to find the bioactive compound with selective anti-cancer properties. The MTT viability and live and dead assays revealed that around 80% and 98% of 4T1 cells survival were declined after 48\u00a0h incubation with leaf and stem extracts, respectively. The leaf extract increased stem cell proliferation by 20% whereas the stem extract inhibited around 22% of stem cells proliferation after 48\u00a0h treatment. The live and dead assay of MSCs confirmed that 40% of the MSCs died when treated with AO stem extract. On the other hand, there were no dead cells after two days of treatment with the leaf extract. Followed by the induction of cell cycle arrest in G0/G1-phase, the real-time PCR demonstrated apoptosis properties in 4T1 cells through overexpression of Bax and down-regulation of BCL2 genes. Interestingly, within the pure compounds isolated from AO leaf extract, Morin was responsible for the inhibition of 4T1 cells proliferation as well as MSCs expansion, predicting to play an essential role in the treatment of cancer. The promising\u00a0in vitro\u00a0anti-cancer and stem cell-inductive properties of morin isolated from AO extract may provide a great potential to produce selective herbal derived drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine, Natural and Medical Sciences Research Center, University of Nizwa, P.
