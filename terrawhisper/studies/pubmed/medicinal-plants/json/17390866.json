The field and laboratory research proved that perpetrators of the diseases on the examined plants were fungi species with the numerical majority. On lemon balm septoria leaf spot (Septoria melissae) was most often observed. Moreover, fungal genera of different taxonomic groups were detected. Alternaria, Epicoccum, Fusarium, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum occurred most often on the medicinal plant samples. The disease mint rust Puccinia menthae, has caused major problems for the peppermint growers. In the populations of fungi found on the diseased leaves the dominating were Alternaria, Epicoccum and Sphaceloma menthae. It has been stated that among all fungi isolated from lemon balm, the species Fusarium avenaceum had the highest pathogenicity to seedlings (80% of diseased seedlings). For peppermint plants the highest pathogenicity had species Epicoccum purpurascens, and caused 82% of diseased seedlings. Conducted evaluation of health status of plants showed that the lemon balm mean disease index was yearly differentiated and was the highest in 2003 (44.39). For peppermint, the highest disease index was in third year of cultivation (62.75) and was statistically higher than in previous years."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Plant Breeding and Seed Science, Agricultural University of Krak\u00f3w, Al. 29 Listopada 54, PL-31-425 Krak\u00f3w, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Szczeponek", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mazur", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Belgium", "MedlineTA": "Commun Agric Appl Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101200320", "ISSNLinking": "1379-1176"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mentha piperita"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Mycoses"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17390866"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
