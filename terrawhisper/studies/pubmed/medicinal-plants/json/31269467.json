The extracted active fraction of XXMD (AF-XXMD) contains almost pharmacological active components with anti-cerebral ischemic effects. However, the illumination of its complex ingredients remains challenging. In this study, ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS) and rapid resolution liquid chromatography-triple quad linear ion trap mass spectrometry (RRLC-QTRAP MS<sup>n</sup>) methods were developed for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of AF-XXMD, respectively. Data showed that 48 compounds were identified in AF-XXMD by using UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, including 14 alkaloids, 14 flavonoids, 12 triterpenoids, 3 chromones, 3 monoterpenes, 1 cyanide glycoside, and 1 volatile oil. Among them, 38 components were unambiguously characterized by their reference standards. A total of 15 compounds in AF-XXMD were first reported. Additionally, 33 compounds were quantified by using RRLC-QTRAP MS<sup>n</sup> in AF-XXMD. This developed RRLC-QTRAP MS<sup>n</sup> method provides an adequate linearity (r<sup>2</sup>\u202f>\u202f0.99) and intrabatch and interbatch variations (RSD\u202f<\u202f15%), with recovery (60.3%-107.5%) of 33 compounds concerned. The total content of 33 compounds in AF-XXMD reached 31.53%. The high total contents of compounds of Xing Ren, Shao Yao, and Huang Qin in AF-XXMD were 9.52%, 8.85%, and 7.62%, respectively. The data further showed that cyanophoric glycosides, monoterpenes, and flavonoids were the three most abundant components in AF-XXMD. Results provide advantageous information for the comprehensive study of the pharmacokinetic features and pharmacological mechanisms of AF-XXMD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
