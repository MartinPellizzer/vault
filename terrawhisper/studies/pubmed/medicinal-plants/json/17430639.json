Total antioxidant activity and reducing ability were measured. 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical and superoxide anion radical scavenging assays were carried out to evaluate the antioxidant potential of the two compounds. The antioxidant activity of the two compounds increased in a concentration-dependent manner. FMC and FMF at a concentration of 500 microM inhibited lipid peroxidation by 64.3 +/- 2.5% and 60.3 +/- 2.3%, respectively, an antioxidant activity approximately similar to that of 500 microM alpha-tocopherol (66.3 +/- 2.5%). Similarly, the effect of FMC and FMF on reducing power increased in a concentration-dependent manner. In DPPH radical scavenging assays, the IC50 values of FMC and FMF were 50.2 +/- 2.8 microM and 75.8 +/- 2.5 microM, respectively. Moreover, FMC and FMF scavenged the superoxide generated by the phenazine methosulfate (PMS)/reduced beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) system, with IC50 values of 56.3 +/- 2.3 microM and 317.5 +/- 2.9 microM, respectively. The anticancer activity of the two compounds were determined in five human cancer cell lines, SMMC-7721 (liver cancer), 8898 (pancreatic cancer), K562 (chronic leukaemia), HeLa (tumour of cervix uteri) and 95-D (high metastic lung carcinoma). FMC and FMF showed broad-spectrum anticancer activity against all the human cancer cell lines tested. The results obtained in the current study indicate that the two flavonoids could be a potential source of natural antioxidant and anticancer agents. To our knowledge, this is the first report on bioactivity of FMC and FMF."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological and Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University of Science and Technology, Hangzhou 310012, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Chun-Lin", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Dong-Zhi", "Initials": "DZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "(2S)-8-formyl-5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-6-methylflavanone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "3'-formyl-4',6'-dihydroxy-2'-methoxy-5'-methylchalcone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H4N855PNZ1", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Tocopherol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chalcones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavanones"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Myrtaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Tocopherol"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17430639", "10.1211/jpp.59.4.0010"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
