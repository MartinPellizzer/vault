The detection of natural substances which can block the process of carcinogenesis is as important as the identification of anti-tumoral drugs since they might be used in chemoprevention of cancer in high-risk groups. In vivo rodent models of chemical carcinogenesis have been used to study plant-derived inhibitors of carcinogenesis such as indoles, coumarins, isothiocyanates, flavones, phenols and allyl-sulfides. Since the standard in vivo rodent bioassay is prolonged and expensive, shorter reliable protocols are needed. Two in vivo medium-term protocols for evaluation of modifiers of carcinogenesis are presented, one related to liver and the other to bladder cancer. Both protocols use rats, last 8 and 36 weeks and are based on the two-step concept of carcinogenesis: initiation and promotion. The protocols use respectively the development of altered foci of hepatocytes expressing immunohistochemically the placental form of glutathione S-transferase and the appearance of pre-neoplastic urothelium and papillomas as the \"end-points\". The use of these protocols for detection of plant-derived inhibitors of carcinogenesis appear warranted."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Patologia, UNESP, Faculdade de Medicina, Botucatu, Brasil."}], "LastName": "de Camargo", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz", "NlmUniqueID": "7502619", "ISSNLinking": "0074-0276"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "23"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1842012", "10.1590/s0074-02761991000600013", "S0074-02761991000600013"]}}]}
