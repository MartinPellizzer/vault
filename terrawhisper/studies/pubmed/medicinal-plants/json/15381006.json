A soluble polysaccharide (SPNa) was obtained after alkaline treatment, which contained Fuc, Ara, Xyl and uronic acid in a 7:44:42:7 molar ratio, with only 2% phenolics. SPNa had an M(W) approximately 1.04 x 10(5) g mol(-1) and was almost monodisperse (M(W)/M(N) : 1.25 +/-0.22). It had a branched structure with side chains of 2-O-substituted Xylp (approximately 8%) and 3-O-substituted Araf (12%) units, and a large proportion of nonreducing end-units of Araf (15%), Fucp (10%), Xylp (4%), and Arap (6%). The (1 --> 4)-linked beta-Xylp main-chain units were 3-O- (9%), 2-O- (13%), and 2,3-di-O- (13%) substituted. Its (13)C NMR spectrum contained at least 9 C-1 signals, those at delta 108.6 and 107.7 arising from alpha-Araf units. Others were present at delta 175.4 from C-6 of alpha-GlcpA and delta 15.6 from C-6 of Fucp units. The main chain of SPNa was confirmed by analysis of a Smith-degraded polysaccharide (SPDS): methylation analysis provided a 2,3-Me(2)-Xyl (65%) derivative and its (13)C NMR spectrum showed five main signals typical of a (1 --> 4)-linked beta-Xylp units. Methylation analysis of a carboxy-reduced polysaccharide (SPN-CR) revealed a 2,3,4,6-Me(4)-Glc derivative (4%) arising from nonreducing end-units of GlcpA. Alpha-GlcpA-(1 --> 2)-alphabeta-Xy1p and alpha-GlcpA-(1 --> 2)-beta-Xylp-(1 --> 4)-alphabeta-Xylp were obtained via partial acid hydrolysis of SPN, showing the structure of side-chain substituents on O-2 of the main-chain units."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Bioqu\u00edmica, Universidade Federal do Paran\u00e1, C.P. 19046, CEP 81531-990 Curitiba, PR, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Simas", "ForeName": "Fernanda F", "Initials": "FF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gorin", "ForeName": "Philip A J", "Initials": "PA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guerrini", "ForeName": "Marco", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Naggi", "ForeName": "Annamaria", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sassaki", "ForeName": "Guilherme L", "Initials": "GL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Delgobo", "ForeName": "Cirene L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iacomini", "ForeName": "Marcello", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Uronic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "28RYY2IV3F", "NameOfSubstance": "Fucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "A1TA934AKO", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "B40ROO395Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Arabinose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Arabinose"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Arecaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gingiva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Uronic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "classification", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Xylans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Xylose"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15381006", "10.1016/j.phytochem.2004.06.004", "S0031942204002420"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
