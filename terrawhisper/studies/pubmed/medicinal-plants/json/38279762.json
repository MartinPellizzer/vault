Inflammation is involved in the etiology of both PD and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Transformations in leucine-rich recurrent kinase 2 (LRRK2) are among the best hereditary supporters of IBD and PD. Elevated levels of LRRK2 have been reported in stimulated colonic tissue from IBD patients and peripheral invulnerable cells from irregular PD patients; thus, it is thought that LRRK2 directs inflammatory cycles.", "Since its revelation, LRRK2 has been seriously linked in neurons, albeit various lines of proof affirmed that LRRK2 is profoundly communicated in invulnerable cells. Subsequently, LRRK2 might sit at a junction by which stomach inflammation and higher LRRK2 levels in IBD might be a biomarker of expanded risk for inconsistent PD or potentially may address a manageable helpful objective in incendiary sicknesses that increment the risk of PD. Here, we discuss how PD and IBD share covering aggregates, especially regarding LRRK2 and present inhibitors, which could be a helpful objective in ongoing treatments.", "English data were obtained from Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane library studies published between 1990-December 2022.", "Inhibitors of the LRRK2 pathway can be considered as the novel treatment approaches for IBD and PD treatment.", "Common mediators and pathways are involved in the pathophysiology of IBD and PD, which are majorly correlated with inflammatory situations.
