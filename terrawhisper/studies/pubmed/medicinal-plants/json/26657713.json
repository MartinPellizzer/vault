A\u00e7a\u00ed berries are rich in polyphenols that probably explains its versatile pharmacological actions and huge consumption, not only in Brazil but also in Europe and United States. In this review, not all but some pharmacological aspects of a\u00e7a\u00ed berries are analyzed. Chemical and pharmacological differences between extracts obtained from the skin and seed of a\u00e7a\u00ed are considered. Polyphenols from the seed of a\u00e7a\u00ed increase endothelial nitric oxide production leading to endothelium-dependent relaxation, reduce reactive oxygen species and regulate key targets associated with lipid metabolism in different conditions such as hypertension, renal failure, and metabolic syndrome. We review the novel mechanisms of actions of a\u00e7a\u00ed on different targets which could trigger the health benefits of a\u00e7a\u00ed such as antioxidant, vasodilator, antihypertensive, cardioprotector, renal protector, antidyslipidemic, antiobesity, and antidiabetic effects in cardiovascular and metabolic disturbances."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Biology, State University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil."}], "LastName": "de Moura", "ForeName": "Roberto S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Resende", "ForeName": "\u00c2ngela Castro", "Initials": "\u00c2C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cardiovasc Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7902492", "ISSNLinking": "0160-2446"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiovascular Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Euterpe"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26657713", "10.1097/FJC.0000000000000347"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
