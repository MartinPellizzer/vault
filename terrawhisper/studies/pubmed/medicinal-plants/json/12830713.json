Oligonucleotide probes specific for these polymorphisms were designed and printed on the poly-lysine coated slides to prepare the DNA chip. PCR products from the Fritillaria species were labeled with fluorescence by incorporation of dye-labeled dideoxyribonucleotides and hybridized to the immobilized probes on the chip.", "The polymorphisms were used as markers for discrimination among various species. Specific oligonucleotide probes were designed and immobilized on a DNA chip. Differentiation of the various Fritillaria species was accomplished based on hybridization of fluorescent labeled PCR products with the DNA chip.", "The results demonstrated the reliability of using DNA chips to identify different species of Fritillaria, and the DNA chip technology can provide a rapid, high throughput tool for genotyping and quality assurance of the plant species verification."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Research Centre for Genomic Technologies, Department of Biology and Chemistry, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsoi", "ForeName": "Pui-yan", "Initials": "PY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Woo", "ForeName": "Hok-sin", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "Man-sau", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shi-lin", "Initials": "SL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fong", "ForeName": "Wan-fung", "Initials": "WF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Pei-gen", "Initials": "PG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Meng-su", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, ribosomal, 26S"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fritillaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12830713"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
