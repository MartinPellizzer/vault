This plant is wild-crafted, and conservationists have expressed concerns with regard to the sustainability of production. In the present work, two factors were found to be of importance for the regeneration of M. dealbata and the production of honokiol and magnolol. These factors were the type of explants and the combination and concentration of plant-growth regulators. Green, compact, nodular organogenic callus was obtained from leaf explants in a medium fortified with Murashige and Skoog salts and supplemented with 1.5 mg/L 2,4-dicholorophenoxyacetic acid and 1.5 mg/L kinetin. Shoots multiplication from callus cultures was achieved in the Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 1.5 mg/L thidiazuron (TDZ). Phenol secretion was controlled by the addition of 250 mg/L of activated charcoal. For rooting, shoots were transferred to MS medium supplemented with several auxins. After root induction, the plants were hardened in earthen pots containing sand, soil, and vermiculite. The contents of honokiol (HK) and magnolol (MG) were determined in different plant materials by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode-array detection techniques. This analysis revealed that the honokiol and magnolol content in aerial and underground parts of micropropagated M. dealbata were higher than that observed in wild plants (both 6 months old). Our results suggest that conservation of M. dealbata is possible by means of in vitro multiplication of leaf-derived callus. The usefulness of M. dealbata regeneration and production of HK and MG may be attributed to the proper selection of explant sourcing and identification of the correct growth medium to support adequate growth. This careful selection of explants and growth medium leads to a very useful source of plant material for pharmacological and phytomedicinal screening applications and, above all, would safeguard this plant species from the threat of extinction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratorio de Biotecnolog\u00eda, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica de Oriente (CIBIOR), Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Km. 4.5, Carretera Federal Atlixco-Metepec, 74360 Metepec, Puebla, M\u00e9xico. irmafabiola@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dom\u00ednguez", "ForeName": "Fabiola", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ch\u00e1vez", "ForeName": "Marco", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gardu\u00f1o-Ram\u00edrez", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda Luisa", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ch\u00e1vez-Avila", "ForeName": "V\u00edctor M", "Initials": "VM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mata", "ForeName": "Mart\u00edn", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cruz-Sosa", "ForeName": "Francisco", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Commun", "NlmUniqueID": "101477873", "ISSNLinking": "1555-9475"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "001E35HGVF", "NameOfSubstance": "magnolol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11513CCO0N", "NameOfSubstance": "honokiol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lignans"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Magnolia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20334134"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
