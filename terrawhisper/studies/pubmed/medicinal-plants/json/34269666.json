Despite being considered beneficial, exaggerated cases can cause severe problems for the body. The main inflammatory manifestations are pain, increased temperature, edema, decreased mobility, and quality of life for affected individuals. Diseases such as arthritis, cancer, allergies, infections, arteriosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic problems are mainly characterized by an exaggerated inflammatory response. Inflammation is related to two categories of substances: pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. Among the pro-inflammatory mediators is Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). It is associated with immune diseases, cancer, and psychiatric disorders which increase its excretion. Thus, it becomes a target widely used in discovering new antiinflammatory drugs. In this context, secondary metabolites biosynthesized by plants have been used for thousands of years and continue to be one of the primary sources of new drug scaffolds against inflammatory diseases. To decrease costs related to the drug discovery process, Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD) techniques are broadly explored to increase the chances of success. In this review, the main natural compounds derived from alkaloids, flavonoids, terpene, and polyphenols as promising TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors will be discussed. Finally, we applied a molecular modeling protocol involving all compounds described here, suggesting that their interactions with Tyr<sup>59</sup>, Tyr<sup>119</sup>, Tyr<sup>151</sup>, Leu<sup>57</sup>, and Gly<sup>121</sup> residues are essential for the activity. Such findings can be useful for research groups worldwide to design new anti-inflammatory TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Federal University of Alagoas, Macei\u00f3, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Dos Santos Nascimento", "ForeName": "Igor Jos\u00e9", "Initials": "IJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Federal University of Alagoas, Macei\u00f3, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, Pharmaceutical Sciences Institute, Federal University of Alagoas, Macei\u00f3, Brazil."}], "LastName": "da Silva-J\u00fanior", "ForeName": "Edeildo Ferreira", "Initials": "EF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Comb Chem High Throughput Screen", "NlmUniqueID": "9810948", "ISSNLinking": "1386-2073"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Secondary Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "17"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34269666", "10.2174/1386207324666210715165943", "CCHTS-EPUB-116740"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
