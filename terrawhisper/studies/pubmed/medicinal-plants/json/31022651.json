The detection principle is that the pesticide could be hydrolyzed to para-nitrophenol (p-NP) in the presence of nanoceria as nanozyme. p-NP exhibits the bright yellow color, and its color intensity has a positive correlation with the pesticide concentration. Meanwhile, the characteristic absorption peak at 400\u202fnm of p-NP increases gradually with the raised concentration of pesticide. Therefore, a dual-mode method including smartphone-based colorimetric and spectroscopic strategies was rationally developed. Herein, methyl-paraoxon was selected as the representative compound. Under the optimum conditions, the detection limits of both two strategies were calculated to be 0.42\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fL<sup>-1</sup>. Finally, the present method was successfully applied in three edible medicinal plants (Semen nelumbinis, Semen Armeniacae Amarum, Rhizoma Dioscoreae). The present work offers a reliable and convenient approach for routine detection of pesticide based on two different detection mechanisms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
