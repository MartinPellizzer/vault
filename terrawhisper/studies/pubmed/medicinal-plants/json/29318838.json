MaxEnt model study found that the standard deviation of seasonal variation of temperature, precipitation in October and other six environmental factors on the growth of D. nipponica are the greatest impacting factors. The range of suitability for the growth of D. nipponica was 4.612 08\u00d710-6-0.544 31, and the regionalization study was divided into four parts: high fitness area, middle fitness area, low fitness area and unfavorable area. The high fitness area is concentrated in the central and southern areas of Jilin Province, using ArcGIS statistical environment factors in the appropriate area of the numerical situation. The results showed that the regionalization study of D. nipponica was basically the same as the actual situation. It is clear that the natural environment suitable for the growth of D. nipponica is also the basis for the protection of the resources and the selection of cultivated area."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jilin Engineering Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources in Changbai Mountain, Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhe", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jilin Engineering Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources in Changbai Mountain, Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jilin Engineering Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources in Changbai Mountain, Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Jing-Lei", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jilin Engineering Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources in Changbai Mountain, Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Da-Cheng", "Initials": "DC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Dioscorea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geographic Information Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Dispersal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29318838", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0187"]}}]}
