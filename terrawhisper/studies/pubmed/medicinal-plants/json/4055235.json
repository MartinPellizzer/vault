The ultraviolet absorption spectra of the photolabeled inhibitors indicated that three out of the five lysines of BBI and one of the seven lysines of CI were modified. The inhibitory activity of the modified inhibitors towards trypsin and chymotrypsin was not reduced even after photolysis. The specific lysine residues that constitute the trypsin-inhibitory sites of BBI and CI did not react with the photoreactive reagents. Further modification of the photoreactive derivatives of BBI and CI with maleic anhydride, directed towards the trypsin-reactive sites, resulted in almost complete loss of the trypsin-inhibiting activity without reducing the ability to inhibit chymotrypsin. A pronounced potentiation effect (approximately 2x) of the chymotrypsin inhibiting activity was noted for 2,5-NAPS-CI and it was retained even after maleylation followed by photolysis, raising the possibility of exposure of an additional chymotrypsin inhibitory site in CI."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Smirnoff", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ramachandran", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Birk", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Int J Pept Protein Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0330420", "ISSNLinking": "0367-8377"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Affinity Labels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitor, Bowman-Birk Soybean"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66365-13-7", "NameOfSubstance": "2-nitro-4-azidophenylsulfenyl chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chymotrypsin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Affinity Labels"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Azides"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Chymotrypsin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitor, Bowman-Birk Soybean"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4055235", "10.1111/j.1399-3011.1985.tb03205.x"]}}]}
