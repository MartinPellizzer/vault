A full factorial design was applied to optimize the formulation containing levofloxacin with or without leucine in different pH values and the optimum condition was determined. Particle size and morphology, crystallinity state, electrostatic charge and surface composition of the particles were determined. Aerodynamic properties of the powders were also assessed by an Andersen cascade impactor after aerosolization through an Aerolizer\u00ae at an air flow rate of 60\u202fL/min. The pH of initial solution affected various physical properties of the drug containing particles and hence their in vitro deposition. The profound effect of pH was on water content, electrostatic charge and surface composition of the particles. The negative effect of water content on in vitro deposition of the drug was covered by preferred surface accumulation of leucine at pH\u202f6. Optimum formulation which obtained by co-spray drying of the drug with 21.79% leucine at pH\u202f5.98 presented a fine particle fraction equal to 54.38. In conclusion, changing pH of the initial solution influenced the effect of leucine on aerosolization of levofloxacine spray dried particles by modification of their physical properties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
