However, a variety of adverse effects have been reported, leading to frequent interruptions of treatment. To investigate the possible metabolic disturbances resulting from antituberculosis (TB) treatment, the uric acid (UA) level of patients on ATDs was measured in the southwest region of Cameroon.", "This hospital-based cross-sectional study involved 96 TB patients on ATDs and 32 controls who were neither on ATDs nor any other treatment that could increase UA levels. The hospital records of consenting participants were reviewed for medical history and questionnaires were issued. About 2 ml venous blood was collected and analyzed using spectrophotometers to determine UA levels.", "Hyperuricemia was observed in 56/96 (58.3%) of the studied group as compared with 4/32 (12.5%) in the control group (P < 0.001). Our results indicated that treatment duration was significantly associated with hyperuricemia (P = 0.0016) while gender (P = 0.1275) was not.", "Hyperuricemia is associated with ATDs, with treatment duration being a significant factor.
