In this regard, the applied analytical methods are mostly costly and time-consuming; therefore, choosing a suitable approach is essential for optimum results and economic suitability. One of the recently considered methods used to characterize new types of materials is MIPs. Among the various applications of MIPs is the identification and separation of various plant-derived compounds, such as secondary metabolites, chemical residues, and pesticides. The present review describes the application of MIPs as a tool in medicinal plant material analysis, focusing on plant secondary metabolism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticulture, Faculty of Agriculture, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Drug Design and Bioinformatics Unit, Medical Biotechnology Department, Biotechnology Research Center, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran 13164, Iran."}], "LastName": "Karimi Baker", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Drug Design and Bioinformatics Unit, Medical Biotechnology Department, Biotechnology Research Center, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran 13164, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sardari", "ForeName": "Soroush", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Iran Biomed J", "NlmUniqueID": "9814853", "ISSNLinking": "1028-852X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Molecularly Imprinted Polymers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Molecularly Imprinted Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patents as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Publications"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Secondary Metabolism"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Fernando WGD.
