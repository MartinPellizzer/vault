The labelled herbicide was applied to autoclaved and non-autoclaved heavy, light and sandy soils at 30 ppm. The treated samples were incubated for 2 months, then extracted and analyzed for metabolic products and bound (nonextractable) 3H-residues. The amounts of bound residues were higher in autoclaved than in nonautoclaved and in sandy than in either heavy or light soils. The mono- and didealkylated products were detected as well as unknown polar derivatives. 3H-residues bound to preextracted soils were absorbed by bean plants. The roots contained (0.20 - 0.72 ppm) more residues than did the shoots (0.07 - 0.15 ppm) and the uptake was higher in the case of autoclaved especially sandy soils."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mostafa", "ForeName": "I Y", "Initials": "IY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zayed", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Adam", "ForeName": "Y M", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Attaby", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health B", "NlmUniqueID": "7607167", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "C8BX46QL7K", "NameOfSubstance": "Trifluralin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Egypt"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Toluidines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trifluralin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7096901", "10.1080/03601238209372318"]}}]}
