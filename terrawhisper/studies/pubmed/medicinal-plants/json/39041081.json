Currently, ursolic acid is mostly extracted from loquat leaves, but the plant extraction method has low yield and high cost, and chemical synthesis is not readily available, so the biosynthesis method provides a new source for ursolic acid. \u03b1-amyrin acts as the main precursor for the synthesis of ursolic acid, and its yield is positively correlated with ursolic acid yield. Oxidosqualene cyclase(OSC) belongs to a multigene family which can catalyze the common precursor 2,3-oxidosqualene to generate different types of triterpene backbones, and plays a decisive role in the synthesis of triterpenoids. However, there are fewer reported key genes catalyzing the synthesis of \u03b1-amyrin in medicinal plants, and the yield and proportion of \u03b1-amyrin in the catalyzed products have always been a focus of research. In this study, ItOSC2, MdOSC1, AaOSC2 and CrAS, four enzymes capable of catalyzing the production of \u03b1-amyrin from 2,3-oxidosqualene, were cloned from Iris tectorum, Malus domestica, Artemisia annua and Catharanthus roseus, subject to sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analyses, and transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae as plasmids. After 7 days of fermentation, the yield and proportions of \u03b1-amyrin, \u03b2-amyrin and ergosterol were measured. Finally, AaOSC2 with the best ability to catalyze the generation of \u03b1-amyrin was filtered out, providing a key gene element for the later construction of engineered yeast strains with high production of \u03b1-amyrin and ursolic acid."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Huaibei Normal University Huaibei 235000, China Anhui Provincial Engineering Laboratory for Efficient Utilization of Featured Resource Plants Huaibei 235000, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Zhi-Peng", "Initials": "ZP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Wan-Tong", "Initials": "WT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Huaibei Normal University Huaibei 235000, China Anhui Provincial Engineering Laboratory for Efficient Utilization of Featured Resource Plants Huaibei 235000, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Xin-Yao", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Hong-Ping", "Initials": "HP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Huaibei Normal University Huaibei 235000, China Anhui Provincial Engineering Laboratory for Efficient Utilization of Featured Resource Plants Huaibei 235000, China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Jian-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Cai-Xia", "Initials": "CX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Intramolecular Transferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.4.99.7", "NameOfSubstance": "lanosterol synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SMK8R7TGJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "30ZAG40J8N", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-amyrin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentacyclic Triterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intramolecular Transferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "metabolism", "chemistry", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pentacyclic Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39041081", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20240216.103"]}}]}
