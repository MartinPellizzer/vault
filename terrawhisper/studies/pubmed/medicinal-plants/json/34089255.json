Rubescin D, 1, crystallizes in the space group P2<sub>1</sub> and its molecular structure consists of three six-membered rings A, C and D having, respectively, envelope, twist-boat and half-chair conformations, and three five-membered rings with half-chair (B and E) and planar conformations (F). Many synthons found in the crystal packing of 1 are in agreement with expectations derived from molecules displaying the same moieties. However, the secondary alcohol-ketone O-H...O=C synthon, which has a low occurrence (2.9%), contributes much to the layered packing, while the furan-ketone Csp<sup>2</sup>-H...O=C and secondary alcohol-epoxide O-H...OC<sub>2</sub> synthons usually found in these compounds (occurrences of 20.6 and 17.6%, respectively) are missing. The packing of 1 is close to that of ceramicine B (3), but is completely different from that of TS3 (4), suggesting that the absence of the epoxide group in 3 would have favoured the furan-secondary alcohol Csp<sup>2</sup>-H...OH synthon and that the missing hydroxy group in 4, a strong hydrogen-bond donor, would have favoured the involvement of water molecules in the crystal packing. The molecular structure of monadelphin A, 2, consists of four six-membered fused rings (A, B, C and D) and one five-membered ring (E); they have twist-boat (A and C), chair (B), screw-boat (D) and planar (E) conformations. The molecule crystallizes in the space group P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> with the contribution of many synthons usually found in compounds having the same moieties. However, the secondary alcohol-acetate O-H...OOC and secondary alcohol-ketone O-H...O=C synthons (occurrences of 16.7% each in these compounds) are missing. The furan-acetate Csp<sup>2</sup>-H...OOC synthon not observed in these compounds greatly contributes to the layered packing of 2. The layered packing is very close to those of 7-oxogedunin (5) and 6-dehydro-7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (6), which both crystallize in the space group P2<sub>1</sub>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1888-0099"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, PO Box 67, Dschang, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Kenfack Tsobnang", "ForeName": "Patrice", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Organic Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, University of Yaound\u00e9 I, PO Box 812, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Tsamo Tontsa", "ForeName": "Armelle", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Higher Teachers' Training College, University of Maroua, PO Box 55, Maroua, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Mbiangu\u00e9", "ForeName": "Yves Alain", "Initials": "YA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Research and Medicinal Plants Studies, PO Box 6163, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Kemda Nangmo", "ForeName": "Pamela", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, PO Box 67, Dschang, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Kenfack Tiofack", "ForeName": "Saurelle", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, PO Box 67, Dschang, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Mkounga", "ForeName": "Pierre", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, PO Box 67, Dschang, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Nkengfack Ephrem", "ForeName": "Augustin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, PO Box 67, Dschang, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Tonl\u00e9 Kenfack", "ForeName": "Ignas", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Acta Crystallogr C Struct Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101620313", "ISSNLinking": "2053-2296"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Furans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ketones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallography, X-Ray"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Furans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Bonding"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ketones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Conformation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "32"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34089255", "10.1107/S2053229621005209", "S2053229621005209"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
