Growing evidence indicates that oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation and apoptosis are associated with aging and the basis of most neurodegenerative disorders. Quercetin is a flavonoid with significant pharmacological effects and promising therapeutic potential. It is widely distributed among plants and typically found in daily diets mainly in fruits and vegetables. It shows a number of biological properties connected to its antioxidant activity. Neuroprotection by quercetin has been reported in many in vitro as well as in in vivo studies. However, the exact mechanism of action is still mystery and similarly there are a number of hypothesis exploring the mechanism of neuroprotection. Quercetin enhances neuronal longevity and neurogenesis by modulating and inhibiting wide number of pathways. This review assesses the food sources of quercetin, its pharmacokinetic profile, structure activity relationship and its pathophysiological role in various NDDs and it also provides a synopsis of the literature exploring the relationship between quercetin and various downstream signalling pathways modulated by quercetin for neuroprotection for eg. nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), Paraoxonase-2 (PON2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1\u03b1), Sirtuins, Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signalling cascades, CREB (Cyclic AMP response element binding protein) and Phosphoinositide 3- kinase(PI3K/Akt). Therefore, the aim of the present review was to elaborate on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the quercetin involved in the protection against NDDs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
