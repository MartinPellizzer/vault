Comprehensive and systematic structural identification of the components of Rheum officinale Baill. remains a challenge. An appropriate analytical method needs to be established for the comprehensive investigation and identification of the chemical constituents in Rheum officinale Baill. extract. In this study, a new systematic approach using ultra high performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in conjunction with a data mining strategy was developed to screen the targeted and nontargeted components of Rheum officinale Baill. A total of 124 compounds were identified in the Rheum officinale Baill. extract including 31 acylglucosides, 9 phenolic acids, 26 tannins, 53 anthraquinones, and 5 other compounds. Note that 55 of these compounds were reported for the first time here. In conclusion, in this study, we devised an efficient and systematic method for detecting complex compounds and have used it here to provide a foundation for future research into bioactive ingredients and quality control of Rheum officinale Baill. extract."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanchang, P.
