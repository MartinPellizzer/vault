An intravenous (i.v.) administration of KML-C (20-50 ng/mouse) 2 days before tumor inoculation significantly inhibited lung metastases of both B16-BL6 and colon 26-M3.1 cells. The prophylactic effect of 50 ng/mouse of KML-C on lung metastasis was almost the same with that of 100 microg/mouse of KM. Treatment with KML-C 1 day after tumor inoculation induced a significant inhibition of not only the experimental lung metastasis induced by B16-BL6 and colon 26-M3.1 cells but also the liver and spleen metastasis of L5178Y-ML25 cells. Furthermore, multiple administration of KML-C given at 3 day-intervals after tumor inoculation led to a significant reduction of lung metastasis and suppression of the growth of B16-BL6 melanoma cells in a spontaneous metastasis model. In an assay for natural killer (NK) cell activity, i.v. administration of KML-C (50 ng/mouse) significantly augmented NK cytotoxicity against Yac-1 tumor cells 2 days after KML-C treatment. In addition, treatment with KML-C (50 ng/mouse) induced tumoricidal activity of peritoneal macrophages against B16-BL6 and 3LL cells. These results suggest that KML-C has an immunomodulating activity to enhance the host defense system against tumors, and that its prophylactic and therapeutic effect on tumor metastasis is associated with the activation of NK cells and macrophages."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Biomedical Research, Han Dong University, Namsong-Ri 3, Buk-Ku, Pohang, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Taek Joon", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoo", "ForeName": "Yung Choon", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Tae Bong", "Initials": "TB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Seong Kyu", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Kyung Bok", "Initials": "KB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Her", "ForeName": "Erk", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Kyung Sik", "Initials": "KS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jong Bae", "Initials": "JB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Arch Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8000036", "ISSNLinking": "0253-6269"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Killer Cells, Natural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophage Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Metastasis"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Transplantation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Viscum album"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14609136", "10.1007/BF02980033"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
