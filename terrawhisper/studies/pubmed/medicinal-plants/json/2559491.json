Although the platelet aggregation caused by thrombin was not inhibited by protopine (100 micrograms/ml), the release reaction was partially suppressed. In rabbit platelet-rich plasma, protopine also inhibited the platelet aggregation caused by ADP, arachidonic acid, PAF and collagen. The thromboxane B2 formation of washed platelets caused by arachidonic acid, collagen, ionophore A23187 and thrombin was suppressed by protopine. Protopine inhibited the intracellular calcium increase caused by arachidonic acid in quin-2/AM loaded rabbit platelets. In the presence of indomethacin, the intracellular calcium increase caused by collagen and PAF was completely suppressed by protopine, and the intracellular calcium increase caused by thrombin was partially inhibited. The phosphoinositides breakdown caused by collagen and PAF was inhibited by protopine, but that by thrombin was not affected significantly. Protopine did not cause the elevation of cyclic AMP level of platelets. It is concluded that the antiplatelet effects of protopine is due to inhibition on thromboxane formation and phosphoinositides breakdown and then lead to the decrease of intracellular calcium concentration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Institute, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei."}], "LastName": "Ko", "ForeName": "F N", "Initials": "FN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "T S", "Initials": "TS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "S T", "Initials": "ST"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "T F", "Initials": "TF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Teng", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Thromb Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0326377", "ISSNLinking": "0049-3848"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzophenanthridines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphatidylinositols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "54397-85-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Thromboxane B2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8L70Q75FXE", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "UIW569HT35", "NameOfSubstance": "protopine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzophenanthridines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Berberine Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Platelets"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylinositols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Thromboxane B2"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2559491", "10.1016/0049-3848(89)90170-9"]}}]}
