This paper discusses the favorable effects of RES, GSE and their nanoformulations for dermatological approaches, with specific emphasis on clinical interventions. In this manner, electronic databases including PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar were searched. Data were collected from 1980 up to February 2019. The search terms included \"Vitis vinifera\", \"grape\", \"resveratrol\", \"skin\", \"dermatology\", and \"nanoformulation\". To increase the skin permeability of GSE and RES, several innovative nanoformulation such as liposomes, niosomes, solid-lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and lipid-core nanocapsule has been evaluated. According to our extensive searches, both RES and GSE have beneficial impacts on skin disorders such as chloasma, acne vulgaris, skin aging, as well as wound and facial redness. More clinical studies with nanoformulation approaches are recommended to achieve conclusive outcomes regarding the efficacy of RES and GSE in the management of skin diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Pharmacy, School of Persian Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PhytoPharmacology Interest Group (PPIG), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soleymani", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student's Research Committee, Faculty of Pharmacy, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Iranpanah", "ForeName": "Amin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Najafi", "ForeName": "Fariba", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Biodiversity Conservation and Management, G.
