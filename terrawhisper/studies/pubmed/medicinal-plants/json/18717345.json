MTT assay was used to detect the cytotoxic effect of ARG in HL-60 and K562 cells. The apoptosis was observed by Hoechst 33258 fluorescence staining and DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. Caspase-3 enzyme activity was measured by caspase-3 enzyme activity detection kit. The expression of related protein was analyzed by Western blotting and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ARG-treated HL-60 cells and K562 cells exhibited growth inhibition and displayed several features of apoptosis, including DNA fragmentation and DNA laddering by agarose gel electrophoresis. It was observed that poly-(ADP-ribose) polymeras (PARP) were cleaved to smaller molecules and ARG induced upregulation of bax and downregulation of bcl-2 protein expression. However, it had no effect on VEGF levels. Taken together, this study demonstrated that ARG is a potent inducer of apoptosis and this was accompanied by caspase-3 activation and upregulation of bax/bcl-2, which offers a potential mechanism for the apoptosis-inducing activity of ARG."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Yantai University, Yantai 264005, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Furans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U76MR9VS6M", "NameOfSubstance": "arctigenin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Arctium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Fragmentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Furans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HL-60 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "K562 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lignans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18717345"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
