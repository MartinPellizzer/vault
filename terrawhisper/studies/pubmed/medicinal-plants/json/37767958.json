It involves the conversion of disaccharides and oligosaccharides into monosaccharides by acting on alpha (1 \u2192 4) and (1 \u2192 6) linked glucose residue. Once absorbed, glucose enters the bloodstream and elevates postprandial glucose, which is associated with the development of type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Epidemic obesity, cardiovascular disease, and nephropathy are linked to T2D. Traditional medicinal plants with \u03b1-G inhibitory potential are commonly used to treat T2D due to the adverse effects of currently used \u03b1-G inhibitors miglitol, acarbose, and voglibose. Various bioactive compounds derived from natural sources, including lupenone, Wilforlide A, Baicalein, Betulinic acid, Ursolic acid, Oleanolic acid, Katononic acid, Carnosol, Hypericin, Astilbin, lupeol, betulonic acid, Fagomine, Lactucaxanthin, Erythritol, GP90-1B, Procyanidins, Galangin, and vomifoliol retain \u03b1-G inhibitory potential for regulating hyperglycaemia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biochemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, India."}], "LastName": "Kumari", "ForeName": "Sonali", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biochemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, India."}], "LastName": "Saini", "ForeName": "Ravi", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biochemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, India."}], "LastName": "Bhatnagar", "ForeName": "Aditi", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biochemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, India."}], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Abha", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Arch Physiol Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9510153", "ISSNLinking": "1381-3455"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "44"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37767958", "10.1080/13813455.2023.2262167"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
