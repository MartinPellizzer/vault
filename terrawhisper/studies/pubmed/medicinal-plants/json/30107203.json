However, there has been controversy in the use of these traditional herbs due to unclear components and absence of scientific proof. As China plans to modernize traditional medicine, successful attempts to better understand the molecular mechanisms of TCM have been made by focusing on isolating active ingredients from these remedies. In this review, we critically examined the current evidence on atheroprotective effects of bioactive compounds from TCM using in vitro or in vivo models in the past two decades. A total of 47 active compounds were included in our review, which were introduced in the order of chemical structures, source, model, efficacy and mechanism. Notablely, this review highlighted the cellular and molecular mechanisms of these active compounds in prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. Two compounds were also involved in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs). Besides, we introduced the legislations of the People's Republic of China ensuring quality and safety of products used in TCM. In summary, studies on bioactive compounds from TCM will provide a new approach for better management of atherosclerosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
