Continual exploration of natural compounds for effective treatments for autoimmune diseases is crucial. Berberine, a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid, is a bioactive component found in various medicinal plants, exhibiting diverse pharmacological properties. This review aims to consolidate the current understanding of berberine's pharmacological effects and mechanisms in addressing four autoimmune diseases: rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis. Overall, as a traditional Chinese medicinal preparation, berberine shows promise as an effective and safe treatment for autoimmune diseases. However, further comprehensive studies, particularly clinical trials, are essential to elucidate additional mechanisms and molecular targets, as well as to assess the efficacy and safety of berberine in treating these autoimmune diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
