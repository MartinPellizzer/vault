Notably, in recent years, there has been a burgeoning interest in treatments using products derived from natural sources, and some have been studied as clinical treatments for a variety of disorders. The use of natural products to treat illness has gained increasing scientific and public interest. Not only to ensure quality control but also to verify their efficacy as active ingredients in various pharmaceutical formulations, the evaluation of natural products is of paramount importance. In this field, analytical methods like spectroscopy, electrophoresis, and chromatography are essential and are constantly being improved upon. Chromatographic techniques are essential for determining the quality and authenticity of natural products. Moreover, strict adherence to internationally recognized norms in validating analytical procedures guarantees the accuracy and dependability of results. Continual research initiatives are essential for tackling issues like adulteration and enhancing customer trust in natural products. This review navigates through the complex field of quality control methodologies and analytical techniques applied in evaluating plant-derived sources, which are generally used as natural products, and focuses on the analysis of Hypericum, Curcuma, and Cannabis species."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1504-1916"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ankara University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacognosy, 06560, Tandogan, Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye."}], "LastName": "Aslan Erdem", "ForeName": "Sinem", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5828-4697"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hacettepe University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Analytical Chemistry, 06100, Sihhiye, Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye."}], "LastName": "Dogan", "ForeName": "Aysegul", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7079-7604"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ankara University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Analytical Chemistry, 06560, Tandogan, Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye."}], "LastName": "Kurbanoglu", "ForeName": "Sevinc", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Comb Chem High Throughput Screen", "NlmUniqueID": "9810948", "ISSNLinking": "1386-2073"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38877859", "10.2174/0113862073285382240526064157", "CCHTS-EPUB-141077"]}}]}
