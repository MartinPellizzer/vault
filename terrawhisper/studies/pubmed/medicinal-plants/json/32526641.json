Epilepsy patients may be treated with adjunctive therapy of GR with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). In particular, carbamazepine (CBZ) is of high potential to interact with concurrent treatment of Chinese Medicine. This study was to investigate the herb-drug interactions of GR and CBZ, an AED, through pharmacokinetic approach in rats.", "We adopted a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system to quantify the plasma level of CBZ and its metabolite (carbamazepine-10, 11-epoxide, CBZE). The method was validated as per instructions under United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) guidance. For the herb-drug interaction study, rats were randomly divided into four different treatment groups: single-dose CBZ treatment, single-dose CBZ/GR treatment, 2-week course of CBZ treatment and 2-week course of CBZ/GR treatment.", "Our results demonstrated the auto-induction of CBZ metabolization when comparing single-dose with 2-week course of CBZ treatment. Pharmacokinetic interactions were noted in concomitant use of GR with CBZ by comparing two single-dose treatments (CBZ versus CBZ/GR). Our data showed that GR increased the mean residence time (MRT0-t) and the time taken to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax) of CBZ in single-dose of CBZ/GR treatment. The maximum drug concentration (Cmax) of CBZ was reduced in single-dose CBZ/GR treatment. When comparing the 2-week course of CBZ treatment with the 2-week course of CBZ/GR treatment, the MRT0-t and half-life of CBZ were increased. The AUC0-t, the Cmax and the half-life of CBZE were increased.", "CBZ/GR treatment may reduce the auto-induction of CBZ over 2 weeks. While the reduction of auto-induction could enhance the therapeutic effects of CBZ, it could also lead to an increase in neurological side effects and non-neurological adverse effects. Our results provided preclinical evidence of herb-drug interaction, which may have implications for epilepsy patients treated with GR."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
