In the present study, acetone extract of ginger at 100 mg/kg p.o. significantly inhibited serotonin (5-HT) induced hypothermia. Therefore, the active constituents of ginger were further examined. The acetone extract was functioned into 4 fractions by column chromatography. Fractions 1 and 2 showed significant activity. Fraction 2 was further purified and [6]-shogaol which was obtained from fraction 2-2, at 10 mg/kg p.o. was shown to inhibit 5-HT induced hypothermia. Anticathartic activity is known to be one of the medicinal effects of ginger. In the present study, acetone extract of ginger at 75 mg/kg p.o., significantly inhibited 5-HT induced diarrhea. In order to clarify the active constituents, the acetone extract was fractionated into 4 fractions by silica gel chromatography. Fractions 2 and 3, which was especially effective, were further purified and [6]-shogoal, [6]-dehydrogingerdione, [8]- and [10]-gingerol were found to have an anticathartic action. [6]-Shogaol was more potent than [6]-dehydrogingerdione, [8]- and [10]-gingerol."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, Japan."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Q", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsuda", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sakai", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamahara", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tamai", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Alcohols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1364PS73AF", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "333DO1RDJY", "NameOfSubstance": "Serotonin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "83DNB5FIRF", "NameOfSubstance": "shogaol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "925QK2Z900", "NameOfSubstance": "gingerol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97F9DE4CT4", "NameOfSubstance": "Ketanserin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BJ4HF6IU1D", "NameOfSubstance": "Pindolol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Catechols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Alcohols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypothermia"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ketanserin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pindolol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Serotonin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2074539", "10.1248/yakushi1947.110.12_936"]}}]}
