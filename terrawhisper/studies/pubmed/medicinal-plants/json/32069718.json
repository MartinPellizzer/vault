The sclerotial mercury concentrations ranged from 0.0043 to 0.027\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>1</sup> dry biomass (db) in the inner white part and 0.019-0.074\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> db in the shell (outer part), while selenium concentrations ranged from < 0.00048 to 0.0040\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> db (white) and 0.0034-0.038\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> db (shell). Positive correlations were found for mercury, as well as for mercury and selenium but they were not consistent for both morphological parts. Mercury concentrations exceeded selenium in 16 of 17 white part pools (molar quotient 0.53 to\u00a0>\u00a010) and in 11 of 17 shell pools (quotient 0.37 to 3.2). The estimated maximal exposure to mercury contained in sclerotial products based on 45\u00a0g per capita daily intake for a 60\u00a0kg individual over one week, was 0.000020\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> body mass (bm; white) and 0.000055\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> bm (shell) on a daily basis, and 0.00014\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> bm (white) and 0.00039\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> bm (shell) on a weekly basis. Relative to mercury, the corresponding intake rates of selenium were considered very low, i.e., they averaged on a daily basis at 0.00075\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> bm (white) and 0.0097\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> bm (shell) with maximum intake at 0.0030\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> bm (white) and 0.028\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> bm (shell)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
