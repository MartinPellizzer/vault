Although pathogenesis of Beh\u00e7et's syndrome is not known, involvement of cellular immunodeficiency has been suggested. In the present paper, the effect of Wen-Qing-Yin on type IV allergic reactions concerned with cellular immunity, and to a lesser extent, formation of humoral antibodies were investigated. Wen-Qing-Yin did not affect the effector phases of type IV allergic reactions including picryl chloride-induced contact dermatitis and footpad reactions induced by sheep red blood cells and tuberculin in mice. However, the induction phases of all these reactions were significantly inhibited with Wen-Qing-Yin. Local graft vs host reaction induced by lymphocytes of Balb/c mice into the footpads of CBF1 mice, was significantly inhibited with Wen-Qing-Yin. The formation of hemolytic plaque forming spleen cells (IgG-PFC and IgM-PFC) from mice were inhibited or tended to be inhibited with Wen-Qing-Yin. Hemolysin formation in the blood of these animals was inhibited or tended to be inhibited with Wen-Qing-Yin. It is suggested that the therapeutic effect of Wen-Qing-Yin on Beh\u00e7et's syndrome may be mainly due to an inhibitory action on the early phases of the cellular immune response."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Koda", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ono", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nishiyori", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nagai", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsuura", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mase", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsuyama", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Immunopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7904799", "ISSNLinking": "0192-0561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z4ZG7O5SZ9", "NameOfSubstance": "Picryl Chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Antibody Formation"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Graft vs Host Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemolytic Plaque Technique"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity, Delayed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Picryl Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3301700", "10.1016/0192-0561(87)90053-1", "0192-0561(87)90053-1"]}}]}
