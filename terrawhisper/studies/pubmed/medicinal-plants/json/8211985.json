Urine and feces were collected throughout the periods and the contents of nitrogen, fat and energy in these excreta were determined. The results obtained were: 1) Digestibility of protein was 95.1 +/- 7.9% for peanuts and 84.8 +/- 3.7% for kidney beans. 2) Digestibility of fat was 83.5 +/- 8.5% for peanuts and 82.4 +/- 9.1% for kidney beans 3) The ratio of the total available energy to intake energy (Net Energy Availability) was 86.1 +/- 6.3% for peanuts and 84.8 +/- 3.1% for kidney beans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, School of Medicine, University of Tokushima, Japan."}], "LastName": "Murai", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miyoshi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Imaki", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fujii", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Tokushima J Exp Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0417356", "ISSNLinking": "0040-8875"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Arachis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8211985"]}}]}
