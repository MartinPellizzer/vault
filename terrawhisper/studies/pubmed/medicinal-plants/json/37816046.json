WEPs are harvested for consumption, sale, and medicinal uses. We hypothesize that WEPs play a major role in supplying food and generating income for the rural people in a world that is increasingly recognising its emerging conservation issues. We tested this hypothesis by identifying the reasons for harvest, consumption, and conservation of WEPs using focus group discussion, field observations and questionnaire surveys in south eastern Bhutan in late 2019.", "Focused group discussions were held with the local people to identify reasons for harvest and consumption of WEPs. Data on the identified reasons for harvest, consumption, and conserving WEPs were determined using a questionnaire survey with ranking scales for a set of 76 randomly selected households. Representative field-observations and questionnaire surveys were carried out in villages close to forests. Parts of the plant used, how these were consumed, harvest season, and plant (life form) were recorded. The data was subjected to a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test and weighted averages calculated.", "A total of 120 WEPs belonging to 63 families (including Agaricaceae) were reported. Most of the WEPs recorded were trees (45.0%) then herbs (25.8%), vines (13.3%) and shrubs (10.8%). The commonly consumed plant parts were the fruit (43.3%), shoots (28.3%) and leaves (20.8%). The purposes for harvesting and consumption, conservation of WEPs were significantly (P<0.001) different, while the motivations for collecting WEPs were not. The motivation for collecting WEPs were family consumption > sale > medicinal uses > preservation for future use > insufficient food from cultivated source's. The two most important strategies for conservation were to domesticate the WEPs and cultivate in forests. The findings reveal valuable lessons and insights about the reasons for harvesting, collection, consumption, and conservation of WEPs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2023 Bajgai et al.
