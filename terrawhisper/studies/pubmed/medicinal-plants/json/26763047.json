An important subject in traditional Persian medicine is digestive disorders, particularly bloating and its etiology. This is a literature review study conducted on The Canon in Medicine written by Avicenna and using the keywords: bloating, gas. In this article, causes for bloating, according to Avicenna, include diet causes, inappropriate lifestyle, gastrointestinal, and miscellaneous reasons. These were compared with causes suggested in modern medicine. Avicenna classifies causes based on the place of origin into upper part of the abdomen (stomach) and intestinal part of the abdomen. Also, 38 medicinal plants used as remedies were listed. Modern scientific data support all bloating causes that have been mentioned in the canon. Obviously, some causes such as uterine disorders and posterior nasal discharge need to be studied further."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2016."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Traditional Medicine Clinical Trial Research Center, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran naseri@shahed.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Naseri", "ForeName": "Mohsen", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Iranian Traditional Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Shahed University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Babaeian", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of History of Medicine, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaffari", "ForeName": "Farzaneh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kamalinejad", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, School of Health, Isfahan University Medical, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Feizi", "ForeName": "Awat", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Traditional Medicine Department, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mazaheri", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Medicine, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mokaberinejad", "ForeName": "Roshanak", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Integrative Functional Gastroenterology Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Adibi", "ForeName": "Peyman", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Evid Based Complementary Altern Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101556804", "ISSNLinking": "2156-5899"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gastrointestinal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Abdominal Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Flatulence"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology", "physiopathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26763047", "10.1177/2156587215622915", "2156587215622915"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
