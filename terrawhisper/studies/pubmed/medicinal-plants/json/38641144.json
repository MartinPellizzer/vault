They play a crucial role in the physiological functions of plants and are well-known for their diverse pharmacological activities. As a representative plant of the Apiaceae family, Angelica sinensis is highly valued for its medicinal properties and FCs are one of the main ingredients of A. sinensis. However, the biosynthetic mechanism of FCs in A. sinensis remains poorly understood. In this study, we successfully cloned and verified three types of enzymes using genome analysis and in vitro functional verification, which complete the biosynthesis of the FCs core skeleton in A. sinensis. It includes a p-coumaroyl CoA 2'-hydroxylase (AsC2'H) responsible for umbelliferone formation, two UbiA prenyltransferases (AsPT1 and AsPT2) that convert umbelliferone to demethylsuberosin (DMS) and osthenol, respectively, and two CYP736 subfamily cyclases (AsDC and AsOD) that catalyze the formation of FCs core skeleton. Interestingly, AsOD was demonstrated to be a bifunctional cyclase and could catalyze both DMS and osthenol, but had a higher affinity to osthenol. The characterization of these enzymes elucidates the molecular mechanism of FCs biosynthesis, providing new insights and technologies for understanding the diverse origins of FCs biosynthesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
