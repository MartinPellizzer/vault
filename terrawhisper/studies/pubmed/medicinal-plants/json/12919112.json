They serve as therapeutic alternatives, safer choices, or in some cases, as the only effective treatment. Folk medicine tradition provides different indicators for use than the medical disease model. Advantages of multiple synergistic components of crude extracts are discussed, as well as herbs already used in dermatology. Bitter digestive stimulants are used for vitiligo. Bioflavinoids from buckwheat and horse chestnut are used for varicose veins, and silymarin is used for liver protection. Gotu kola and sarsaparilla are used for inflammatory skin conditions. Oregon grape root has synergistic antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and bile-stimulating properties which make the crude extract useful in acne. Philosophical differences in herbology compared to medicine exist in the application of science toward improving elimination and strengthening the host as opposed to destroying the vector or manifestation of the disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Integrative Medicine and Dermatology, New Rochelle, New York 10805, USA. drdattner@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dattner", "ForeName": "Alan M", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Dermatol Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "9700070", "ISSNLinking": "1396-0296"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Diseases"}], "NumberOfReferences": "26"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12919112", "10.1046/j.1529-8019.2003.01618.x", "01618"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
