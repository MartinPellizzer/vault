Thus, the silent epidemic has complex pathophysiology affecting the brain along with extracranial or systemic complications in more than one organ system, including the heart, lungs, liver, kidney, gastrointestinal and endocrine system. which is referred to as Multi-Organ Dysfunction Syndrome. It is driven by three interconnected mechanisms such as systemic hyperinflammation, paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity, and immunosuppression-induced sepsis. These multifaceted pathologies accelerate the risk of mortality in clinical settings by interfering with the functions of distant organs through hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, acute lung injury, neurogenic pulmonary edema, reduced gastrointestinal motility, Cushing ulcers, acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, endocrine dysfunction, and many other impairments. The pharmaceutical treatment approach for this is highly specific in its mode of action and linked to a variety of side effects, including hallucinations, seizures, anaphylaxis, teeth, bone staining, etc. Therefore, alternative natural medicine treatments are widely accepted due to their broad complementary or synergistic effects on the physiological system with minor side effects.", "This review is a compilation of the possible mechanisms behind the occurrence of multiorgan dysfunction and reported medicinal plants with organoprotective activity that have not been yet explored against traumatic brain injury and thereby, highlighting the marked possibilities of their effectiveness in the management of multiorgan dysfunction. As a result, we attempted to respond to the hypothesis against the usage of medicinal plants to treat neurodegenerative diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guru Jambheshwar University of Science & Technology, Hisar, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Thakur", "ForeName": "Manisha", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guru Jambheshwar University of Science & Technology, Hisar, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Vasudeva", "ForeName": "Neeru", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guru Jambheshwar University of Science & Technology, Hisar, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Sunil", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology/Regulatory Toxicology, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Raebareli, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Datusalia", "ForeName": "Ashok Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "101269155", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5273"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "5"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36045522", "10.2174/1871527321666220830164432", "CNSNDDT-EPUB-126021"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
