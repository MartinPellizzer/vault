The issues and challenges associated with various stages of the analytical method development are discussed using Ginkgo biloba and Panax ginseng as case studies. LC-MS offers selectivity and specificity in both the chromatographic separation and detection steps. This is necessary in order to measure compounds at extremely low concentrations as is often observed in plasma and urine samples. Traditional methods of detection (UV-visible) do not offer sufficient selectivity and specificity needed. The strategies and pitfalls involved with the measurement of such compounds are discussed in this review. Matrix effects, 'unseen' matrix suppression and enhancement ionization effects can significantly reduce the accuracy and precision of the measurement. The impact of the correct choice of chromatography column formats on signal-to-noise ratio is also discussed. Analytical methods from sample preparation to mass spectrometric detection is outlined in order to provide good direction for analysts intent on the measurement of bioavailable compounds from herbal medicines in plasma and urine samples."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Complementary Medicine Research, University of Western Sydney, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith South DC, NSW 1797, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gray", "ForeName": "Michael J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Dennis", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jianxun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bensoussan", "ForeName": "Alan", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Body Fluids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}], "NumberOfReferences": "71"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19650043", "10.1002/bmc.1287"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
