The methanolic extract of Gentianae Scabrae Radix (GSR) showed the most dramatic changes after enzyme reaction, as seen in the high-performance liquid chromatography profiles and an increase in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging effect. Trifloroside (1, TF) was identified as being significantly decreased by enzyme reaction, whereas deglucosyltrifloroside (2, DTF) increased. The optimal reaction time to induce DTF was 24\u2009h at 30\u00b0C. The content increased from 1.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29\u2009mg/g of extract (g<sub>ex</sub>) to 2.80\u2009\u00b1\u20090.85\u2009mg/g<sub>ex</sub> after 24\u2009h of enzyme reaction. DTF showed better antioxidative effect than TF in the DPPH, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HT22 cell assays. In addition, when HT22 cells were stressed by 5\u2009mM glutamate, 50\u2009\u03bcM of DTF significantly inhibited the glutamate-induced lactate dehydrogenase leakage, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, lipid peroxidation, and intracellular ROS production. These data demonstrated that the enzyme-treated GSR and its increased level of antioxidant DTF could be useful as a starting point in the discovery of functional foods to prevent various oxidative stresses, especially neurodegenerative disorders."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Kyungpook National University , Daegu, Korea."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Eun-Ju", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Kyungpook National University , Daegu, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Ju-Gyeong", "Initials": "JG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Kyungpook National University , Daegu, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 GHAM BioPharm Co.
