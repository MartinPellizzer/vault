In recent years, substantial progress has been made in understanding the relationship between starch structure and functionality. However, these studies have been mainly on cereal and tuber starches. The present status of knowledge on the composition, structure, functionality, digestibility, and chemical modification of legume starches is reviewed. In addition present concepts of granule structure, gelatinization, retrogradation, and rheology are also reviewed. Future research needs in the area of legume starch chemistry are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, Canada."}], "LastName": "Hoover", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sosulski", "ForeName": "F W", "Initials": "FW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372712", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4212"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}], "NumberOfReferences": "130"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2036604", "10.1139/y91-012"]}}]}
