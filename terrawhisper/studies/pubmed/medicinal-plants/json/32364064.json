Several cellular and biomolecular pathways are implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD, yet the etiology is unclear. Activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in the intestinal epithelial cells was also shown to induce inflammation. This review focuses on the inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway and its potential application in treating IBD. We also provide an overview of plant-derived compounds that are beneficial for the IBD management through modulation of the mTOR pathway. Data were extracted from clinical, in vitro and in vivo studies published in English between 1995 and May 2019, which were collected from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus and Cochrane library databases. Results of various studies implied that inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway downregulates the inflammatory processes and cytokines involved in IBD. In this context, a number of natural products might reverse the pathological features of the disease. Furthermore, mTOR provides a novel drug target for IBD. Comprehensive clinical studies are required to confirm the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors in treating IBD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology &amp; Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Lashgari", "ForeName": "Naser-Aldin", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology &amp; Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Roudsari", "ForeName": "Nazanin Momeni", "Initials": "NM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Institute of Medicinal Plants, ACECR, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Momtaz", "ForeName": "Saeideh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology &amp; Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghanaatian", "ForeName": "Negar", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology &amp; Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kohansal", "ForeName": "Parichehr", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Health Institute, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Farzaei", "ForeName": "Mohammad Hosein", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Experimental Medicine Research Center, Department of pharmacology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Afshari", "ForeName": "Khashayar", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Halal Research Center of IRI, FDA, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sahebkar", "ForeName": "Amirhossein", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology &amp; Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abdolghaffari", "ForeName": "Amir Hossein", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "W36ZG6FT64", "NameOfSubstance": "Sirolimus"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sirolimus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32364064", "10.2174/0929867327666200504081503", "CMC-EPUB-106316"]}}]}
