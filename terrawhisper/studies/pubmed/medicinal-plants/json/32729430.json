There are 20-25% chances of progression of acne to severe cases, which leads to permanent scarring that results in psychological problems like depression, social isolation, lowered self-esteem, and lowered self-confidence.", "Though several conventional treatments are available in the market but still there are various adverse effects associated with topical anti-acne agents due to which it lacks patient compatibility. The present study is undertaken to find out the major shortcoming; why the current therapies do not give the desired therapeutic results.", "Novel drug delivery strategies can play a crucial role in the enhancement of topical delivery of anti-acne agents by escalating their dermal localization and reducing their adverse effects. Consumption of medicinal plants like Aloe vera, Withania somniferia etc. have clinical evidence regarding the effective management of acne. The current inclination towards nanotechnology is considerable due to several changes in the pharmaceutical research area. To secure the research work in different pharmaceutical fields, patents are filed against various agents like Galderma Research & Development have filed patents for adapalene and benzoyl peroxide for the management of acne vulgaris. The current review highlights the potential of various novel drug delivery approaches like liposomes, niosomes, ethosomes, transfersomes etc. in enhancing the topical delivery of anti-acne agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Pharmacy, Amity University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Neha", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Pharmacy, Amity University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Apoorva", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Pharmacy, Amity University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Pandey", "ForeName": "Kalpana", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Pharmacy, Amity University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Nimisha"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Recent Pat Antiinfect Drug Discov", "NlmUniqueID": "101266084", "ISSNLinking": "1574-891X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cosmetics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dermatologic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetracyclines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Acne Vulgaris"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Topical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cosmetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatologic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patents as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tetracyclines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32729430", "10.2174/1574891X15999200729192138", "PRI-EPUB-108686"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
