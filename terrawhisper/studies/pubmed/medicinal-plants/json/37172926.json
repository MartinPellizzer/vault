Ferroptosis is an atypical form of iron-dependent modulated necrosis and have been proven to contribute to the progress of diabetic nephropathy. Vitexin, a flavonoid monomer derived from medicinal plants that has various biological activities including anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects, has not been investigated in diabetic nephropathy studies. However, whether vitexin has a protective effect on diabetic nephropathy remains unclear. In this study, the roles and mechanism of vitexin on alleviating DN were explored in vivo and in vitro. The protective effect of vitexin in diabetic nephropathy were evaluated by in vitro and in vivo experiment. In this research, we validated that vitexin protect HK-2 against HG-induced damage. Besides, vitexin pretreatment also reduced fibrosis (Collagen type I Col I, TGF-\u03b21). Furthermore, vitexin inhibited ferroptosis induced by HG, accompanied by changes of morphological, decrease of ROS, Fe<sup>2+</sup> and MDA, and increased GSH levels. Meanwhile, vitexin up-regulated the protein expression of GPX4 and SLC7A11 in HG-induced HK-2\u00a0cells. Moreover, knockdown of GPX4 by shRNA migrated the protective effect of vitexin on HG-challenged HK-2 and reversed the ferroptosis induced by vitexin. Consistent with in vitro, vitexin alleviated renal fibrosis, damage and ferroptosis in DN rat. In conclusion, our findings revealed that vitexin could alleviate diabetic nephropathy by attenuated ferroptosis via activating GPX4."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
