The assay is based on competitive binding to enzyme-labeled lectin of a known lectin receptor, bound to a solid phase, and unknown sample receptors. In this paper the assay is exemplified with the mannose/glucose-specific pea lectin, with the glycoprotein ovalbumin as its receptor, and with horseradish peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) as the enzyme used for labeling. Also a method was developed for the preparation of peroxidase-labeled lectin. Labeling was started by mixing equimolar amounts of lectin and periodate-oxidized enzyme at pH 4.5 at a final concentration of 10(-4)M, after which conjugation was started by raising the pH to 9.5. This resulted in complete conjugation, after which the product could be diluted 50-500 times for application in ELBA. For the ELBA ovalbumin was adsorbed onto polystyrene microtiter plates. Sample receptors, added together with the enzyme-labeled lectin, inhibited binding of the latter to ovalbumin. Bound enzyme activity was colorimetrically determined after addition of o-phenylenediamine. Relative lectin affinity (KL) was expressed as (formula; see text) in which [X]50% is the concentration of sample receptor necessary to inhibit 50% of the binding of a certain amount of lectin, and [M]50% is the concentration of D-mannose necessary to inhibit 50% binding of the same amount of lectin. With this technique lectin affinity of both monovalent and polyvalent lectin binding substances can be estimated: low KL values mean high lectin affinity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "van der Schaal", "ForeName": "I A", "Initials": "IA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Logman", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "D\u00edaz", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kijne", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370535", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Mitogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Horseradish Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding, Competitive"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Horseradish Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Mitogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6486415", "10.1016/0003-2697(84)90131-3", "0003-2697(84)90131-3"]}}]}
