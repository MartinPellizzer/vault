The loss of water-deficiency-induced crop yield is the largest among all natural hazards. Under water-deficient stress, the most prevalent response to terminal stress is to accelerate the early arrest of floral development and, thereby, to accelerate fruit/seed production, which consequently reduces seed size. This phenomenon is well-known, but its molecular mechanism is not well-reviewed and characterized. However, increasing evidence have indicated that water-deficient stress is always coordinated with three genetic signals (i.e., seed size regulators, initial seed size, and fruit number) that decide the final seed size. Here, our review presents new insights into the mechanism underlying cross-talk water-deficient stress signaling with three genetic signals controlling final seed size. These new insights may aid in preliminary screening, identifying novel genetic factors and future design strategies, or breeding to increase crop yield."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plant of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Science , Jiangsu Normal University , Xuzhou , Jiangsu 221116 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Meng-Jiao", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plant of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Science , Jiangsu Normal University , Xuzhou , Jiangsu 221116 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plant of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Science , Jiangsu Normal University , Xuzhou , Jiangsu 221116 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8844-4356"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plant of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Science , Jiangsu Normal University , Xuzhou , Jiangsu 221116 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Lai-Sheng", "Initials": "LS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Droughts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31403787", "10.1021/acs.jafc.9b02497"]}}]}
