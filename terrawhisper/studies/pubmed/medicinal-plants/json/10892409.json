Moreover, the plasma insulin level was increased concomitantly with the decrease of plasma glucose level. However, due to the high incidence of atherosclerosis in diabetes, the present study has been continued for further investigation of the effect of garlic extract on the coronary vascular ultrastructural changes. In addition, to identify the possible mechanism(s) of garlic's therapeutic effects, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, aspirin, has been included in this present study. By using transmission electron microscopic studies, 16 weeks of daily oral feeding of garlic extract (100 mg/kg BW) caused as an antiatherosclerotic agent at the coronary arteriolar (15-30 microns) wall in STZ-rats. Interestingly, the thickening of coronary capillary (5-10 microns) basement membrane also was significantly attenuated within the group of STZ-rats treated with garlic extract. However, the possible direct action of garlic through the cyclooxygenase pathway has not been confirmed by the results of aspirin: The daily oral feeding of aspirin (10 mg/kg BW) in 16-week STZ-rats has not showed reduced arteriolar vascular wall abnormalities. The irregular patterns of fiber matrix, arranging the basement membrane at the arteriolar walls, were still recognized in the same manner as in STZ-rats. Interestingly, the thickening of the capillary basement membrane occurred in 16-week STZ-rats seems to be attenuated by the aspirin received. At present, garlic extract may open the new era in the medicinal use of garlic to prevent diabetic cardiovascular complications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Patumraj", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tewit", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amatyakul", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jariyapongskul", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maneesri", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kasantikul", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shepro", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Drug Deliv", "NlmUniqueID": "9417471", "ISSNLinking": "1071-7544"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R16CO5Y76E", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspirin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Arterioles"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Aspirin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Capillaries"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred WF"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10892409", "10.1080/107175400266650"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
