Many species of the genus <i>Liparis</i> have been commonly used as traditional herbal medicines for the treatment of menorrhagia, haemoptysis, traumatic bleeding, snake bites, and pneumonia. This review describes the ornamental value of plants of the genus <i>Liparis</i> and summarises the chemical constituents and pharmacological activities reported during the last decade. The main chemical constituents of this genus are phenolic acids, alkaloids, flavonoids, etc. Most phenolic acids and alkaloids have a nervogenic acid skeleton, and most alkaloids also have a pyrrolizidine skeleton. Extracts from the genus <i>Liparis</i> plants showed significant haemostatic, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities. This paper proposed ideas and research directions for the future study of plants in the genus <i>Liparis</i>, providing valuable information for the development of new drugs and promoting their utilisation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Gannan Healthcare Vocational College, Ganzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bing", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Gannan Healthcare Vocational College, Ganzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Li-Yun", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Gannan Healthcare Vocational College, Ganzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Gannan Healthcare Vocational College, Ganzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Ling", "ForeName": "Zhi-Jie", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Gannan Healthcare Vocational College, Ganzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yan-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Gannan Healthcare Vocational College, Ganzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Ouyang", "ForeName": "Xi-Lin", "Initials": "XL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38693725", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2347460"]}}]}
