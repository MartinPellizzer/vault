Proteomic analysis showed 24 protein spots were changed, including 17 spots that were increased and 7 spots that were decreased. Ginsenoside Rg1 could restore the expression levels of these proteins, at least partly, to basic levels of untreated cells. The expression of G-protein coupled receptor kinase, protein kinase C (PKC)-zeta, N-ras protein were decreased, while cycle related protein p21 was increased by ginsenoside Rg1 in TNF-alpha treated VSMC.", "PKC-zeta and p21 pathway might be the mechanism for inhibitory effects of ginsenoside Rg1 on proliferation of VSMC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Radiation Medicine Sciences, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing 100850, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Zeng-Chun", "Initials": "ZC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yu-Guang", "Initials": "YG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Hong-Ling", "Initials": "HL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Cheng-Rong", "Initials": "CR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Sheng-Qi", "Initials": "SQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "protein kinase C zeta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Kinase C"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.5.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PJ788634QY", "NameOfSubstance": "ginsenoside Rg1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Aorta"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "G1 Phase"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Myocytes, Smooth Muscle"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Kinase C"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16867250", "10.1111/j.1745-7254.2006.00331.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
