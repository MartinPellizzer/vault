Light-adapted roots appeared green and had radially thickened morphology compared with dark-grown controls. Their growth rates were higher than dark-grown controls, with 45% lower doubling times: LBE-6-1, 3.6 days; LBE-4-2, 2.8 days. Relative to dark-grown controls, light-adapted growth increased the biomass (DW) of LBE-6-1 by 25%, but had no effect on the DW of LBE-4-2. The macronutrients NH4+, NO3-, Pi, and sugars, were depleted completely by light-adapted root cultures in that order. The specific and total levels of the indole alkaloid serpentine was enhanced and of tabersonine was lowered in both root clones, while the overall trends of growth and non-growth association of tabersonine and serpentine, respectively, remained unaltered by light adaptation. Ajmalicine accumulation was enhanced in LBE-6-1, but lowered in LBE-4-2; its accumulation was growth-associated in dark-grown LBE-6-1, but appeared non-growth associated in light-adapted cultures. The accumulation of tabersonine-related compounds, lochnericine, and h\u00f6rhammericine exhibited growth-associated trends, and were either negatively affected or unaffected by light adaptation of LBE-6-1. Neither vindoline nor its precursor, deacetylvindoline, was detected."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, MS-142, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005-1892, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhadra", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morgan", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shanks", "ForeName": "J V", "Initials": "JV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Bioeng", "NlmUniqueID": "7502021", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3592"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indole Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2Y49VWD90Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Yohimbine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4429-63-4", "NameOfSubstance": "tabersonine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4QJL8OX71Z", "NameOfSubstance": "raubasine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "B503RKE34F", "NameOfSubstance": "serpentine (alkaloid)"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indole Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Indoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quinolines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Yohimbine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "9"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "9"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10099477", "10.1002/(sici)1097-0290(19981220)60:6<670::aid-bit4>3.0.co;2-j", "10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19981220)60:6<670::AID-BIT4>3.0.CO;2-J"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
