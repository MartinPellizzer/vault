Growth and chlorophyll a of the cells were only slightly affected by low concentrations but drastically reduced by high concentrations. The rate of protein synthesis progressively decreased by increasing extract concentration. The cells preferentially induced the synthesis of a limited number of polypeptides in response to the treatment. Among the induced polypeptides were those with apparent molecular weights of 161K (161,000), 96.7K, 93.4K, 85K, 69.9K, 59K, 49K, 45K, 35K, 32.4K, 28K, 24K, 21.7K, 18K, and 16K based on their mobilities in gel electrophoresis. These initial studies suggest that the plant extract exerted certain stress which stimulated alteration in the pattern of protein synthesis in Synechococcus sp. Some of the induced polypeptides are similar to that known to occur in other stresses, especially heat-shock stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botany Department, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Beni-Suef Branch, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hammouda", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Borb\u00e9ly", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Ecotoxicol Environ Saf", "NlmUniqueID": "7805381", "ISSNLinking": "0147-6513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Molluscacides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Molluscacides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7498056", "10.1006/eesa.1995.1063", "S0147-6513(85)71063-9"]}}]}
