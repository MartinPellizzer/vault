UV-Visible (UV-Vis) Spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy characterize synthesized P-AgNPs. The motility and survival rate of the worms were recorded for the helminthicidal activity. Percent mortality of larvae of A. albopictus and A. aegypti was recorded for larvicidal activity.", "The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of P-AgNPs showed a strong surface plasmon absorption band in the visible region with a maximum absorption at 445 nm indicating the synthesis of silver nanoparticles by the addition of aqueous fruit peel extract. The XRD spectrum of P-AgNPs showed Bragg's reflection peaks 2\u03b8 value characteristics for the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) structure of silver. The sharp absorption peak in FTIR at 1659 cm-1 assigned to C=O stretching vibration in carbonyl compounds represents terpenoids, flavonoids and polyphenols in the corona of PAgNPs; a 2 mg/mL of P-AgNPs. The concentration aqueous extract and P-AgNPs showed complete death of worms (the morphological alteration/coiling of body). A 20 ppm concentration of PAgNPs showed 85% mortality in larvae of Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti. P-AgNPs were nontoxic at low concentrations.", "The aqueous extracts played a dual role as reducing and capping agent during the biosynthesis of AgNPs as per FTIR and XRD results.
