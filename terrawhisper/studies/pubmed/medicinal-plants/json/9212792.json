The molecular mechanisms responsible for these protective effects are still unclear. Here we report on the quantification of O6-methylguanine [O6-MeG] by immuno-slot-blot analysis in DNA of root tip meristems of field bean (Vicia faba) seedlings under conditions of clastogenic adaptation. When root tips were pretreated with a low, conditioning dose of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU, 10(-4) M, 1 hour) 2 hours before exposure to a high dose of the same clastogen (10(-3) M, 1 hour), the frequency of chromatid aberrations was reduced by more than 50% at a recovery time of 1 B hours, as compared to treatment with the high dose alone. The same was observed when conditioning pretreatment was by a sublethal heat shock [10 minutes, 40 degrees C] or a heavy metal salt (Cd(NO)3, 10(-7) M, 1 hour). The frequency of O6-MeG immediately after exposure to a conditioning and a subsequent challenge treatment was reduced by 43% as compared to treatment with only the high dose. At a recovery time of 18 hours the corresponding frequency of adducts was reduced by 68.3% (related to the initial level) after treatment with the high dose alone, and by 81.3% under adaptive conditions. Sublethal heat shock or heavy metal salt used as conditioning pretreatments also resulted in a decrease of adducts immediately after treatment with the challenge dose. From these data and from prevention of the effects by pretreatment with cycloheximide or O6-benzylguanine we conclude that under conditions of clastogenic adaptation O6-MeG is more efficiently removed from the DNA, presumably by induction of an alkyl acceptor protein such as O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase [MGMT]. This could explain the observed protective effects (clastogenic adaptation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Pflanzengenetik und Kulturpflanzenforschung, Gatersleben, Germany."}], "LastName": "Baranczewski", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nehls", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rieger", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rajewsky", "ForeName": "M F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schubert", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Mol Mutagen", "NlmUniqueID": "8800109", "ISSNLinking": "0893-6692"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkylating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Adducts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5Z93L87A1R", "NameOfSubstance": "Guanine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "684-93-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylnitrosourea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9B710FV2AE", "NameOfSubstance": "O-(6)-methylguanine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Alkylating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Aberrations"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Adducts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Guanine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoblotting"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Meristem"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Methylnitrosourea"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9212792", "10.1002/(sici)1098-2280(1997)29:4<400::aid-em9>3.0.co;2-d", "10.1002/(SICI)1098-2280(1997)29:4<400::AID-EM9>3.0.CO;2-D"]}}]}
