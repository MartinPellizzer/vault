The development of genuine regional herbs faces problems such as insufficient supply of local resources and lack of competitive advantages. It is necessary to seek a suitable model to protect and develop authentic medicinal materials. The protection mode of geographical indication products has become more mature. Geographical indication(GI) products and authentic medicinal materials are all related to the origin. There is certain commonality between them. However, there are also differences between authentic Chinese herbal medicines and geographical indications, and it is unsuitable to simply equate the authentic Chinese medicinal materials with GI products. This article comprehensively combs and compares the development of the authentic Chinese herbal medicines and geographical indication products, and believes that it is necessary to fully learn from the experience of GI products and combine the characteristics of authentic medicinal materials to establish a set of protection systems that meet the characteristics of authentic medicinal materials. Through this research, it has positive significance to promote the protection and management of authentic medicinal materials."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "An-Qi", "Initials": "AQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Chi", "ForeName": "Xiu-Lian", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Guang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100091, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Que", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30989932", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20181204.001"]}}]}
