Recently, pharmacological properties of different constituents of <i>F. szowitsiana</i> have been reported. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of the methanolic extract of <i>F. szowitsiana</i> root on human isolated lymphocytes. The effects of either <i>F. szowitsiana</i> (10, 40 and 160 \u03bcg/ml) or dexamethasone (0.1 mM) were evaluated on the levels of cell proliferation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO) production, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, and total glutathione content (GSH) as well as the secretion of inflammatory cytokines [interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1] in the presence or absence of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation (<i>n</i> = 8 for each group). PHA stimulation notably elevated ROS, NO, MDA, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 levels as well as diminished GSH, CAT and SOD levels. In PHA-stimulated, the results also revealed that <i>F. szowitsiana</i> (10-160 \u00b5g/ml) significantly decreased MDA, ROS, NO, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels as well as increased CAT, SOD and GSH levels. Collectively, <i>F. szowitsiana</i> is able to attenuate the overproduction of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in the presence of PHA-stimulated T lymphocytes, while to propagate the anti-oxidative defense. Contextually, the plant has promising healing effects in the different inflammatory disorders associated with the interference of the acquired immune system such as multiple sclerosis and asthma."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9268-6270"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Askari", "ForeName": "Vahid Reza", "Initials": "VR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Baradaran Rahimi", "ForeName": "Vafa", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Assaran", "ForeName": "Amin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Iranshahi", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Boskabady", "ForeName": "Mohammad Hossein", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferula"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30764672", "10.1080/01480545.2019.1572182"]}}]}
