It is a proven carcinogen as it is a strong oxidizing agent that generates free radicals during xenobiotic metabolism. Urtica dioica (Ud) (from the plants' family of Urticaceae) is a plant that has long been used as a medicinal plant in many parts of the world. It has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immunosuppressive properties. So, this study aimed to clarify the effect of Potassium bromate on the histological structure of cerebral cortex of adult male albino rats, evaluate the possible protective role of Urtica dioica. Thirty adult healthy male albino rats were divided into three groups; group I (Control group), group II (KBrO3 treated group). Group III (KBrO3 and Urtica dioica treated group).At the end of the experiment, rats in all groups were anesthetized and specimens were processed for light and electron microscope. Morphometric and statistical analyses were also performed. Nerve cells of the treated group showed irregular contours, dark nuclei, irregular nuclear envelopes, dilated RER cisternae, and mitochondria with ruptured cristae. Vacuolated neuropil was also observed. Immunohistochemically, stained sections for GFAP showed strong positive reaction in the processes of astrocytes. Recovery group showed revealed nearly the same as the histological picture as the control group. In conclusion, potassium bromate induces degenerative effects on neurons of cerebral cortex and urtica dioica provide an important neuroprotective effects against these damaging impacts through their antioxidant properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Histology and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mahmoud", "ForeName": "Abeer A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Histology and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Zayed Mohamed", "ForeName": "Maha", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Histology and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hassen", "ForeName": "Ebtehal Z", "Initials": "EZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ultrastruct Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "8002867", "ISSNLinking": "0191-3123"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "04MB35W6ZA", "NameOfSubstance": "potassium bromate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Urtica dioica"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cerebral Cortex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38017656", "10.1080/01913123.2023.2287664"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
