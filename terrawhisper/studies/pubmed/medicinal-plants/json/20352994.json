A total of 363 bands were scored, 314 bands of them were polymorphic and the average was 18.47 polymorphic bands per primer pair, which were up to 86.50% polymorphic ratio. The results indicated that there was abundant genetic diversity among the tested materials. Genetic similarity coefficient was ranged from 0.4959 to 0.8182.
