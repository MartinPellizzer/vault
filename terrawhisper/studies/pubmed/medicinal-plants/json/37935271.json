Together with twenty-one known compounds (4-24) were isolated and identified from Lepidium obtusum Basin. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis and ECD calculations. The isolated compounds were tested for their antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. Among them, compounds 11, 12, 14, 21 and 23 showed moderated antimicrobial activities against (Candida albicans, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus). Compounds 11, 12, 14, 15, 17 and 18 exhibited potent antioxidant activities against ABTS and DPPH. Compound 1 exhibited moderated anti-inflammatory activities. Compounds 4-24 were isolated from this plant for the first time."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
