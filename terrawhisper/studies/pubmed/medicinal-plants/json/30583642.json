In order to clarify the original plant species and geographical distribution of Fructus Aurantii which recorded in the standards and circulated, used in commodity. The national and local standards of Chinese medicinal materials were collected and the original plants of Fructus Aurantii recoded in standards were found. Ten original plant species of Fructus Aurantii (including varieties of cultivars, the same below) were recorded in the Chinese pharmacopoeia and six local standards of Zhejiang, Yunnan and Guizhou etc. The producing areas and commodity in markets of Fructus Aurantii were investigated. The growth environment and geographical distribution of them were analyzed. There are six types of Fructus Aurantii i.e., Fructus Aurantii Chuan, Fructus Aurantii Xiang, Fructus Aurantii Jiang, Fructus Aurantii Qu, Fructus Aurantii Su, Fructus Aurantii Wen, and nineteen species of original plants in the practical commodities. There are four major Fructus Aurantii producing areas: Sichuan Basin, Dongting Lake Plain, Poyang Lake Plain, Jinqu Basin and its surrounding hilly areas. All of them are located in the area of the east longitude 104\u00b0 to 121\u00b0 and the northern latitudes 27\u00b0 to 31\u00b0. There is a certain difference between the actual commodity and the standards of medicinal materials. It is suggested that the traditional mainstream types of Fructus Aurantii with fine quality should be accepted into Chinese Pharmacopoeia, and the types with poor quality should be withdrawn from Chinese Pharmacopoeia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Institute for Food and Drug Control, Hangzhou 310052, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Wei-Liang", "Initials": "WL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Institute for Food and Drug Control, Hangzhou 310052, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Zeng-Xi", "Initials": "ZX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Institute for Food and Drug Control, Hangzhou 310052, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wen-Ting", "Initials": "WT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Institute for Food and Drug Control, Hangzhou 310052, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Qin-Wei", "Initials": "QW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Institute for Food and Drug Control, Hangzhou 310052, China."}], "LastName": "Yi", "ForeName": "Ze", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Quzhou Institute for Food and Drug Control, Quzhou 324002, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Jian-Feng", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Citrus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30583642", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2018.0116"]}}]}
