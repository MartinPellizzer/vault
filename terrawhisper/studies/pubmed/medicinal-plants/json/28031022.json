However, the interactions of multi-targets targeted by effective ingredients of kidney-tonifying Chinese herbal medicines are unknown. In this study, to explore the systems pharmacology mechanisms of kidney-tonifying Chinese medicines on anti-aging, we establish the molecular networks with the interactions of multi-targets, analyze bio-functions and pathways with IPA, and calculated the mutual interaction pairs of targets (target pairs) with data mining, respectively.", "Kidney-tonifying Chinese medicines with anti-aging effects were screened from the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and the literatures. Target proteins of these herbal medicines were obtained from bioinformatics databases. Comparisons of molecular networks, bio-functions and pathways given by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis system showed the similarities and the differences between kidney Yin-tonifying herbal medicines and kidney Yang-tonifying herbal medicines. Target pairs with high correlation related to anti-aging were also discovered by data mining algorithm. And regulatory networks of targets were built based on the target pairs.", "Twenty-eight kidney-tonifying herbal medicines with anti-aging effects and 717 related target proteins were collected. The main bio-functions that all targets enriched in were \"Cell Death and Survival\", \"Free Radical Scavenging\" and \"Cellular Movement\", etc. The results of comparison analysis showed that kidney Yin-tonifying herbal medicines focused more on \"Cancer related signaling\", \"Apoptosis related signaling\" and \"Cardiovascular related signaling\". And kidney Yang-tonifying herbal medicines focused more on \"Cellular stress and injury related signaling\" and \"Cellular growth, proliferation and development related signaling\". Moreover, the results of regulatory network showed that the anti-aging related target pairs with high correlated degrees of Kidney Yin-tonifying herbal medicines included TNF-PTGS2, TNF-CASP3, PTGS2-CASP3, CASP3-NOS2 and TNF-NOS2, and that of kidney Yang-tonifying herbal medicines included REAL-TNF, REAL-NFKBIA, REAL-JUN, PTGS2-SOD1 and TNF-IL6.", "In this study, we achieved some important targets, target pairs and regulatory networks with bioinformatics and data mining, to discuss the systems pharmacology mechanisms of kidney-tonifying herbal medicines acting on anti-aging. Mutual target pairs related to anti-aging found in this study included TNF-PTGS2, TNF-CASP3, PTGS2-CASP3, CASP3-NOS2, TNF-NOS2, REAL-TNF, REAL-NFKBIA, REAL-JUN, PTGS2-SOD1 and TNF-IL6. Target pairs and regulatory networks of targets could reflect more potential interactions between targets and comprehensive effects on anti-aging. Compared with the existing researches, it was found that the kidney-tonifying herbal medicines may exert anti-aging effects in multiple pathways in this study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Airport Road NO.12, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China. jiangqiyu@gzucm.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Qi-Yu", "Initials": "QY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Airport Road NO.12, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Mei-Si", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Airport Road NO.12, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Jing", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Airport Road NO.12, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China. sunxiaosheng@gzucm.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xiao-Sheng", "Initials": "XS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "BMC Complement Altern Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101088661", "ISSNLinking": "1472-6882"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computational Biology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Data Mining"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Regulatory Networks"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Sun X-s.
