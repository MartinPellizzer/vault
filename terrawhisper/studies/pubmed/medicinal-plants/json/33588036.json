The exopolysaccharide from Chlorella (CEPS) displays remarkable anticancer activity the mechanism of which remains to be elucidated. In this study, we analyzed the inhibitory effect of CEPS on the growth of HeLa cells. The results showed that CEPS inhibited the proliferation, decreased the viability, and changed the morphology of HeLa cells. Transcriptome analysis showed that 1894 genes were differentially expressed in the CEPS-treated group compared with the control group, including 1076 genes that were upregulated and 818 genes that were downregulated. The results of gene function enrichment analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in apoptosis and tumor-related biological processes and participated in several cancer and apoptosisrelated signaling pathways, including the MAPK signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The protein-protein interaction network identified 13 DEGs including PTPN11, RSAD2, ISG15, IFIT1, MX2, IFIT2, OASL, OAS1, JUN, OAS2, XAF1, ISG20, and IRF9 as hub genes. Our results suggest that CEPS is a promising therapeutic drug for the follow-up interventional therapy of cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
