The clinical signs of caprine haemonchosis included inappetence, dullness and soft faeces and were correlated with the pathological findings. None of these changes were observed in four of the six goats following the treatment with 2, 10 or 30 g of Artemisia shoots. This successful therapy was supported by the absence of eggs in the faeces, of adult worms in the abomasum at necropsy and of significant lesions in the tissues of the goats and return of the concentrations of serum ammonia, sodium, potassium, total protein and creatinine and of the activity of aspartate aminotransferase (GOT) to normal. In two goats, treated with either 10 or 30 g of Artemisia shoots, egg production was not completely suppressed and a few adult Haemonchus worms were found in the abomasum."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Idris", "ForeName": "U E", "Initials": "UE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Adam", "ForeName": "S E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tartour", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Natl Inst Anim Health Q (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0413132", "ISSNLinking": "0027-951X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthelmintics"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anthelmintics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Goats"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Haemonchiasis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Trichostrongyloidiasis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7162537"]}}]}
