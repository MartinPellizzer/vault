Field surveys and literatures show that A. oxyphylla has widely used as a medicinal and edible plant,it is an important raw material for many Chinese patent medicines,health products and food,with a long history of artificial cultivation and application. The future development is prospected on health market. But A. oxyphylla industry has faced a lot of problems,including unreasonable planting layout,lack of good varieties,imperfect seed breeding system,low level of standardization,inconsistent quality of medicinal materials,low level of industry,and so on. The suggestions for sustainable development are listed below.First,it is essential to strengthen the research on the basis and application technology of A. oxyphylla,speed up the selection and breeding of improved varieties,and popularize standardized cultivation techniques. Secondly,it is important to strengthen the research on quality standards,improve the quality evaluation system of medicinal materials. Thirdly,it is necessary to take full advantage of the functional components to develop functional products with Hainan characteristics,find out the unique product characteristics of A. oxyphylla,build a famous brand and improve the product competitiveness in the market. It is also important to strengthen policy support and industrial supervision,promote the healthy and rapid development of A. oxyphylla industry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tropical Crops Genetic Resource Institute,Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences Danzhou 571737,China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Xiao-Xia", "Initials": "XX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tropical Crops Genetic Resource Institute,Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences Danzhou 571737,China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Bao-Lan", "Initials": "BL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tropical Crops Genetic Resource Institute,Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences Danzhou 571737,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Mao-Yuan", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tropical Crops Genetic Resource Institute,Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences Danzhou 571737,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qing-Long", "Initials": "QL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tropical Crops Genetic Resource Institute,Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences Danzhou 571737,China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tropical Crops Genetic Resource Institute,Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences Danzhou 571737,China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tropical Crops Genetic Resource Institute,Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences Danzhou 571737,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhu-Nian", "Initials": "ZN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alpinia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31342727", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190301.006"]}}]}
