Most compounds effectively suppressed the enzymatic activities of FAK, and the IC<sub>50</sub>s of 11b and 12f were 2.75 and 1.87\u00a0nM, respectively. 11b and 12f exhibited strong antiproliferative effects against seven human cancer cells, with IC<sub>50</sub> values against two FAK-overexpressing pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1 and BxPC-3) of 0.98\u00a0\u03bcM, 0.55\u00a0\u03bcM, and 0.11\u00a0\u03bcM, 0.15\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. Moreover, 11b and 12f obviously suppressed the colony formation, migration, and invasion of PANC-1\u00a0cells in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, these two compounds could induce the apoptosis of PANC-1\u00a0cells and arrest the cell cycle in G2/M phase according to the flow cytometry assay. Western blot revealed that 11b and 12f effectively inhibited the FAK/PI3K/Akt signal pathway and significantly decreased the expression of cyclin D1 and Bcl-2. In addition, compounds 11b and 12f potently inhibited the antiproliferative of HUVECs and obviously altered the cell morphology. 11b and 12f also significantly inhibited the migration, tube formation of HUVECs and severely impaired the angiogenesis in the zebrafish model. Overall, these results revealed the potential of compounds 11b and 12f as promising candidates for further preclinical studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.
