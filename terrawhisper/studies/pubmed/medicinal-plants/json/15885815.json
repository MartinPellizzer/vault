Many biological activities, including anti-hepatitis B virus, anti-Epstein-Barr virus and anti-retroviral reverse transcriptase, of P. urinaria have been reported, but not against herpes simplex virus (HSV). In this study, the anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activities of different solvents extracted from P. urinaria were investigated in vitro by plaque reduction assay. Results showed that acetone, ethanol and methanol extracts of P. urinaria inhibited HSV-2 but not HSV-1 infection. The 50% inhibitory concentration against HSV-2 infection (IC50) of acetone, ethanol and methanol extracts was 4.3 +/- 0.5, 5.0 +/ -0.4 and 4.0 +/- 0.9 mcg/ml, respectively. All three extracts showed no cytotoxic effect against Vero cells at concentrations of 10.0 mcg/ml or below. The time-of-addition study demonstrated that these three extracts were only effective when added during the HSV-2 infection which, therefore, suggested that they disturb the initial stage of HSV-2 infection. Furthermore, they can diminish virus infectivity without significantly affecting incubation time and temperature. Therefore, the acetone, ethanol and methanol extracts of P. urinaria were concluded to likely inhibit HSV-2 infection through disturbing the early stage of virus infection and through diminishing the virus infectivity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, No. 100, Shin-Chuan 1'st Road, Kaohsiung Medical University, 807 Kaohsiung, Taiwan, ROC."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chien-Min", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Hua-Yew", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Ta-Chen", "Initials": "TC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiang", "ForeName": "Lien-Chai", "Initials": "LC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Chun-Ching", "Initials": "CC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Antiviral Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8109699", "ISSNLinking": "0166-3542"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1364PS73AF", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorocebus aethiops"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Herpesvirus 2, Human"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phyllanthus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vero Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viral Plaque Assay"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15885815", "10.1016/j.antiviral.2005.02.008", "S0166-3542(05)00070-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
