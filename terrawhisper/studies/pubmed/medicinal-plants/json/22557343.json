Since the related species Anaphalis morrisonicola and Cnicus benedictus were reported for its anti cancer activities, the above mentioned plants were screened for Invitro antioxidant activity. In vitro antioxidant studies were carried out by DPPH, Nitric oxide and Hydrogen peroxide methods for the aerial part extracts of the plants. Different extracts were obtained from the aerial parts of the whole plant by successive solvent extraction and cold maceration process and subjected for Invitro antioxidant activity studies. Among the extracts tested, the ethyl acetate extract of Anaphalis neelgerriana DC and Cnicus wallchi DC showed significant anti oxidant activity in all the above methods. The potent ethyl acetate extract should be tested for anti oxidant activity in animal models."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PSG College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacognosy, Peelamedu, Coimbatore, Tamilnadu, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vijaylakshmi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nanjan", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suresh", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Anc Sci Life", "NlmUniqueID": "8307589", "ISSNLinking": "0257-7941"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22557343", "PMC3336312"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
