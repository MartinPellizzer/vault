Many plant-derived chemical substances with biological activity are inadvertently ingested by collegiate athletes daily through canton-style herbal tea or herbal slow-cooked soup. In the view of the complexity of herbal ingredients, it is still no full survey reported for the sports risk of plant-derived sports doping. This research is firstly a descriptive statistical analysis. Collegiate athletes with different socio-economic characteristics from medical colleges in 3 different regions in China participated in the questionnaire survey. Three survey forms, including the oral interview, email inquiry, handing out and recovering the questionnaires in live, were developed and performed by researchers. It was first found that collegiate athletes resorted to some traditional herbal materials to protect their health care that there were regional differences (P\u200a<\u200a.01). Collegiate athletes with Health Fitness and Traditional Wushu as their sports expertise showed a higher frequency of recognition or ingestion in the use of traditional herbal materials (P\u200a<\u200a.01), while their different living types and cuisine preferences did not seem to be associated with the ingestion frequency of traditional herbal materials. In addition, in the view of the significant differences in the use of herbal preparations to relieve sports stress among young athletes in different regions (P\u200a<\u200a.01), the findings strongly suggested that athletes should strictly control their use of various herbal preparations during sports training and competition, including herbal wines, herbal oils, topical plasters, analgesic tablets."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 the Author(s).
