This is some ten times less than with synthetic antidepressants. The most common adverse events (1 per 300,000 treated cases) among the spontaneous reports in the official register concern reactions of the skin exposed to light. Investigations in volunteers have shown that the threshold dose for an increased risk of photosensitisation is about 2-4 g/day of a usual commercial extract (equivalent to approximately 5-10 mg of the hypericin that causes the phenomenon). In view of the newly observed side effects and interactions, the following additional restrictions on use appear justified: as with all preparations in this group of indications, hypericum preparations must not be taken at the same time as other antidepressants. If co-medication with coumarin-type anticoagulants is unavoidable, it must only be undertaken provided clotting parameters are closely monitored by the physician. Co-medication with cyclosporin and indinavir, and for the time being, other protease inhibitors used in anti-HIV treatment, is absolutely contraindicated. Without exception, all preparations of St. John's wort must only be available through pharmacies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "volkschu@t-online.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schulz", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"], "VernacularTitle": "H\u00e4ufigkeit und klinische Relevanz der Interaktionen und Nebenwirkungen von Hypericum-Pr\u00e4paraten."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Praxis (Bern 1994)", "NlmUniqueID": "101468093", "ISSNLinking": "1661-8157"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depressive Disorder"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herb-Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}], "NumberOfReferences": "46"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11155496"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
