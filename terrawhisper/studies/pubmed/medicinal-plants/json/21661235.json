In response, the Meiji government dispatched Masatsugu Takeda of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to Java and India from March to August 1878 for the purpose of investigating useful plants of tropical origin and introducing them to Japan. This paper clarifies the route to those destinations and the plants obtained locally. Using the seeds obtained from India during his travels, the cultivation of cinchona was attempted in 1882 for the first time in Japan. In Ogasawara, coffee cultivation was conducted, again for the first time in Japan, using coffee seeds brought back from Java. The cultivation of coffee was successful and served as the foundation of the Ogasawara coffee that exists to this day. Takeda also introduced a number of books and materials related to useful tropical plants available as a result of his travels, which contributed to the promotion of new industries and businesses in the Meiji era."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hoshi University. 2-4-41 Ebara, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo 142-8501."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nagumo", "ForeName": "Seiji", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sasaki", "ForeName": "Yohei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takido", "ForeName": "Michio", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakushigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "1267223", "ISSNLinking": "0285-2314"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coffee"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cinchona"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coffee"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indonesia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21661235"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
