Their structures were determined by spectroscopic analysis and examined alongside existing data from prior studies. Separated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity in HeLa, HCT-8, MCF-7 and HepG2 human cancer cell lines, and compounds 1 and 2 showed significant effects against HeLa cells with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 3.21 and 8.57\u202f\u03bcM, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
