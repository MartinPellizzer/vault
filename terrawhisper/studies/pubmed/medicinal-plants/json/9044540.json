This belief is here tested by analyzing literary sources on the use of wine and poppy derivatives in the Greek and Roman civilizations. As expected, the existence of elaborated myths about the discover of wine supports the view that wine drinking played an important social role in the ancient world. Contingencies in which drinking was considered illicit were carefully selected with the ultimate aim of maintaining sobriety. Rules of drinking were often enforced by law. This first part of the study lists drunkenness outcomes considered particularly harmful by the Ancients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Pharmacology, University of Rome La Sapienza, Italy."}], "LastName": "Nencini", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Subst Use Misuse", "NlmUniqueID": "9602153", "ISSNLinking": "1082-6084"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "8008-60-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Opium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Alcoholic Intoxication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greek World"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Opium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Papaver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Roman World"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Wine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9044540", "10.3109/10826089709027300"]}}]}
