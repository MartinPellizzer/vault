Both plants are rich in volatile terpenoids, including monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, which are the primary medicinal components of Fructus Amomi. The trans-isopentenyl diphosphate synthase (TIDS) gene family plays a key part in determining terpenoid diversity and accumulation. However, the TIDS gene family have not been identified in W. villosa and W. longiligularis. This study identified thirteen TIDS genes in W. villosa and eleven TIDS genes in W. longiligularis, which may have expanded through segmental replication events. Based on phylogenetic analysis and expression levels, eight candidate WvTIDSs and five WlTIDSs were selected for cloning. Functional characterization in vitro demonstrated that four homologous geranyl diphosphate synthases (GPPSs) (WvGPPS1, WvGPPS2, WlGPPS1, WlGPPS2) and two geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases (GGPPSs) (WvGGPPS and WlGGPPS) were responsible for catalyzing the biosynthesis of geranyl diphosphate (GPP), whereas two farnesyl diphosphate synthases (FPPSs) (WvFPPS and WlFPPS) catalysed the biosynthesis of the farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). A comparison of six proteins with identified GPPS functions showed that WvGGPPS and WlGGPPS exhibited the highest activity levels. These findings indicate that homologous GPPS and GGPPS together promote the biosynthesis of GPP in W. villosa and W. longiligularis, thus providing sufficient precursors for the synthesis of monoterpenes and providing key genetic elements for Fructus Amomi variety improvement and molecular breeding."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS.
