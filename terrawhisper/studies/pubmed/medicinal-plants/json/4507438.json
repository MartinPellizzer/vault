Upon admission, the temperature was 36.9 degrees C, pulse 100, and respirations 32. Blood pressure was 120/70. Oxygen, prednisone, furosemide, chlordiazepoxide, and morphine were administered. The woman died the 2nd day. Clinical diagnoses showed that the woman died of carcinoma of the breast with metastoses to mediastinal lymph nodes, the chest wall and the lungs, and that lymphoma was inactive. Radiation may have caused the late malignant tumor. A late radiation-induced complication may be another malignant tumor. It is noted that radiation therapy may be a calculated risk in some cases."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["722408", "00018097"], "GeneralNote": [], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Breast Cancer", "Cancer", "Case Studies", "Diseases", "Neoplasms", "Research Methodology", "Studies"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "4507438", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1972", "Month": "12", "Day": "26"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0028-4793", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "287", "Issue": "21", "PubDate": {"Year": "1972", "Month": "Nov", "Day": "23"}}, "Title": "The New England journal of medicine", "ISOAbbreviation": "N Engl J Med"}, "ArticleTitle": "Case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital.
