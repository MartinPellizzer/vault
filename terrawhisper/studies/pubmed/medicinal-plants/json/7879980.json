Ferulenol was detected in the plasma of all sheep at initial blood sample collection, 6 hours after the first dose of approximately 75 g of FCb was placed in the rumen. The last observed peak of approximately 20 micrograms/ml was detected at about 12 hours after the last of 8 doses, and the mean concentration then decreased to < 1 microgram/ml during the next 70 hours. Maximal concentration of ferulenol and time for plasma clearance varied with individual sheep. The PT increased steadily to a maximum of 6 times normal about 70 hours after the last peak plasma ferulenol concentration and about 80 hours after FCb administration was stopped. The PT then returned to almost normal (ratio of 1.12) from the maximum (ratio of 6.12) within approximately 5 days. The APTT results generally paralleled the PT results, but the change was not as marked. Maximal PT and APTT ratios were animal-dependent and not always related to plasma ferulenol concentration. The activity of all the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors was depressed, but the variations were unique to each factor. Factor V, a vitamin K-independent coagulation factor actually had a brief period of increased plasma activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Pathology, Agronomique et Veterinaire Hassan II, Rabat, Morocco Institut."}], "LastName": "Tligui", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ruth", "ForeName": "G R", "Initials": "GR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Felice", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Vet Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0375011", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9645"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Coagulation Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6805-34-1", "NameOfSubstance": "ferulenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Coagulation Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Specimen Collection"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ferula"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Partial Thromboplastin Time"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prothrombin Time"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sheep Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7879980"]}}]}
