As the dried aerial parts have medicinal values, S. orientalis is widely grown in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. One almost 600 m2 block of S. orientalis plants with stunting and leaf withering symptoms was found in Luonan County (110.26 E, 34.06 N), Shaanxi Province, in August 2022. Many galls were observed on the roots of these plants, and densities of second-stage juveniles (J2s) were 260~370 per 100 cm3 of soil. Females and eggs were dissected from infected roots, and J2s and males were extracted from the soil for species identification. The perineal patterns of females (n=20) were oval-shaped, with minor dorsal arches, distinct lateral fields, and tiny punctations around anus. The head caps of males were high and obviously narrower than head region which broadened out of the first body annuli. Morphological measurements of females (n=20) were: body length (L) = 897.66 \u00b1 50.89 (860.96-949.74) \u03bcm, body width (BW) = 577.69 \u00b1 51.01 (489.91-638.65) \u03bcm, stylet length (ST) = 14.03 \u00b1 0.63 (13.25-14.97) \u03bcm, dorsal pharyngeal gland orifice to stylet base (DGO) = 4.96 \u00b1 0.47 (4.08-5.37) \u03bcm, vulval slit length = 18.82 \u00b1 1.97 (17.24-22.02) \u03bcm, vulval slit to anus distance = 13.62 \u00b1 1.22 (12.34-16.18) \u03bcm. Measurements of males (n=10) were: L = 1298.73 \u00b1 95.96 (1202.77-1394.69) \u03bcm, BW = 28.24 \u00b1 2.38 (25.93-30.55) \u03bcm, ST = 20.23 \u00b1 0.78 (19.42-21.04) \u03bcm, DGO = 4.89 \u00b1 0.44 (4.56-5.22) \u03bcm, spicule length = 28.98 \u00b1 1.68 (26.94-31.02) \u03bcm. Measurements of J2s: L = 375.35 \u00b1 14.02 (341.01-400.46) \u03bcm, BW = 15.09 \u00b1 1.47 (12.02-16.82) \u03bcm, ST = 12.74 \u00b1 0.61(11.46-13.84) \u03bcm, DGO = 2.58 \u00b1 0.59 (1.61-3.7) \u03bcm, tail length= 74.15 \u00b1 13.73 (50.92-95.09) \u03bcm, hyaline tail terminus= 11.36 \u00b1 2.27 (9.53-17.85) \u03bcm. These morphological characteristics were consistent with those of Meloidogyne hapla Chitwood, 1949 as described by Whitehead (1968). The DNA of single females (n=10) was isolated using the Proteinase K method for molecular identification (Kumari and Subbotin, 2012). The sequence of rDNA-ITS region was amplified and sequenced with the primers rDNA-F/R (TTGATTACGTCCCTGCCCTTT/TTTCACTCGCCGTTACTAAGG) (Vrain et al., 1992). The 768 bp sequence (GenBank OP542552) was 99.74% identical to the rDNA-ITS sequences of M. hapla (JX024147 and OQ269692). Then the D2/D3 fragments of the 28S rRNA were amplified and sequenced with the primers D2A/D3B (ACAAGTACCGTGAGGGAAAGTTG/TCGGAAGGAACCAGCTACTA) (McClure et al., 2012). The 762 bp fragment (OP554218) showed 100% identical to sequences of M. hapla (MN752204 and OM744204). To confirm the pathogenicity of the population, six 2-week-old healthy S. orientalis seedlings cultured in sterilized sand were each inoculated with 2,000 J2s hatched from egg masses. Four non-inoculated seedlings served as negative controls. After maintenance at 25\u00b0C for 60 days, galls appeared on the roots of inoculated plants, being consistent with the symptoms observed in field, while the negative controls showed no symptoms. Females collected from inoculated plants were identified as M. hapla with species-specific primer JWV1/ JWV (Adam et al., 2007), which amplified a fragment of 440 bp. Parasitism was also confirmed by the average recovery of 3,814 J2s per inoculated plant with the reproductive factor of 1.91. This is the first report of S. orientalis being a host of M. hapla. The disease reduces the quality and yield of S. orientalis, and much more efforts would be made for its control in production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bio-Agriculture Institute of Shaanxi, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Plant Nematology, No. 125, Xianning Middle Road, Xincheng District, Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, xian, Shaanxi, China, 710043; yangyiwei05@163.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yiwei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bio-Agriculture Institute of Shaanxi, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Plant Nematology, xian, Shaanxi, China; changq@xab.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bio-Agriculture Institute of Shaanxi, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Plant Nematology, Xian, Shaanxi, China; mysrenping@163.com."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bio-Agriculture Institute of\u00a0Shaanxi, Shaanxi Academy of\u00a0Sciences, No. 125, Xianning Road, Xincheng District, Shaanxi province, China, Xian, China, 710043; letusgo2007@163.com."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Song", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bio-Agriculture Institute of Shaanxi, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Plant Nematology, Xi'an, China; zhijiechen68@sina.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "ZhiJie", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, West Yuanmingyuan Road No.2,, Beijing, China, 100193; dlpeng@ippcaas.cn."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Deliang", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bio-Agriculture Institute of Shaanxi, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Plant Nematology, No 125, Xianning road, xian, Shaanxi, China, 710043; liym@xab.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "YingMei", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38971963", "10.1094/PDIS-01-24-0054-PDN"]}}]}
