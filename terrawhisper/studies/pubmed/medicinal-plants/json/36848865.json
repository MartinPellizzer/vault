However, the relationship between the chlorogenic acid (CGA) content and light in plants remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of shading treatment on gene expression and CGA content in Lonicera macranthoides Hand.-Mazz. (LM), a widely used medicinal plant. A total of 1891 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained in flower buds and 819 in leaves in response to light in shading treatment compared to the control sample by RNA-Seq. After shading treatment, the content of CGA in LM leaves decreased significantly by 1.78-fold, the carotenoid content increased, and the soluble sugar and starch contents significantly decreased. WGCNA and the expression of related genes verified by qRT\u2012PCR revealed that CGA synthesis pathway enzyme genes form a co-expression network with genes for carbohydrate synthesis, photosynthesis, light signalling elements, and transcription factor genes (TFs) that affect the accumulation of CGA. Through a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system and CGA assay in Nicotiana benthamiana (NB), we determined that downregulation of NbHY5 expression decreased the CGA content in NB leaves. In this study, we found that light provides energy and material for the accumulation of CGA in LM, and light affects the expression of CGA accumulation-related genes. Our results show that different light intensities have multiple effects on leaves and flower buds in LM and are able to coregulate LmHY5 expression and CGA synthesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
