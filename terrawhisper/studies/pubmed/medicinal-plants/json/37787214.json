However, the antibacterial effects of most of them have not yet been clarified in endodontics.", "This study aimed to determine the antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants' methanolic extracts against some root canal microorganisms.", "In this in vitro study, after gathering the five plants (pomegranate peel, clove, Zhumeria majdae, Eucalyptus galbie and green tea), their methanolic extracts were obtained by the maceration method, and the antimicrobial activity was determined using micro- and macro-dilution methods. The microorganisms tested in this study were Enterococcus (E.) faecalis, Porphyromonas (P.) gingivalis and Fusobacterium (F.) nucleatum. Non-ready-to-use calcium hydroxide (CH), ready-to-use Calcipex II CH and methanol were used as control materials.", "The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests were used to analyse and evaluate the data and variables.", "In all concentrations and time intervals studied, eucalyptus extract showed the highest antimicrobial activity against E. faecalis. All the extracts showed growth-inhibitory effects against P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum. There were no significant differences between the anti-enterococcus effects of eucalyptus extracts and non-ready-to-use CH (P > 0.05).", "There was a greater efficacy of Eucalyptus galbie extract than other extracts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Endodontics, Kerman Dental School, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran; Department of Orofacial Pain and Dysfunction, Academic Center for Dentistry of Amsterdam (ACTA), University of Amsterdam and Vrije University Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}], "LastName": "Raoof", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Institute of Neuropharmacology, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zadeh", "ForeName": "Mohammad H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Afzalipour Medical School, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nejad", "ForeName": "Zahra E", "Initials": "ZE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Herbal and Traditional Medicines Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sharififar", "ForeName": "Fariba", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Forests and Rangelands Research Department, Kerman Province Agriculture and Natural Resources Research Center, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khodashenas", "ForeName": "Mansooreh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Endodontics, Kerman Dental School, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fereidooni", "ForeName": "Rahim", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Dent Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9202990", "ISSNLinking": "0970-9290"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Pulp Cavity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enterococcus faecalis"}], "CoiStatement": "None"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "50"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37787214", "10.4103/ijdr.ijdr_625_22", "IndianJDentRes_2023_34_2_204_386092"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
