Scopolamine (SCO), a muscarinic receptor antagonist that disrupts cognition and memory acquisition, is considered a psychopharmacological AD model. We investigate the effectiveness of medicinal plants in mitigating the SCO-induced neurobehavioural damage in rats. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Animals were injected with Scopolamine hydrobromide trihydrate (2.2\u2009mg/kg IP.) daily for 2\u2009months. Each treatment group was administered one of four medicinal spice extracts (Nigella sativa, 400\u2009mg/kg; rosemary, 200\u2009mg/kg; sage, 600\u2009mg/kg and ginseng; 200\u2009mg/kg 90\u2009minutes after SCO injection. Animals were subjected to cognitive-behavioural tests (NOR, Y-maze and MWM). After the experiment, we extracted the brains for histopathological examination and biochemical assessment for oxidative stress (levels of TT, CAT and TBARS) and gene expression of acetylcholinesterase and brain monoamines. <b>Results:</b> As expected, SCO treatment impaired memory and cognition, increased oxidative stress, decreased neurotransmitters and caused severe neurodegenerative changes in the brain. <b>Conclusion:</b> Surprisingly, these effects were measurably moderated by the administration of all four plant extracts, indicating a neuroprotective action that we suggest could alleviate AD disease manifestations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Animal and Poultry Management and Wealth Development Department, Beni-Suef University, Beni-Suef, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abdelghany", "ForeName": "Asmaa K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pathology Department, Beni-Suef University, Beni-Suef, Egypt."}], "LastName": "El-Nahass", "ForeName": "El-Shymaa", "Initials": "ES"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ibrahim", "ForeName": "Marwa A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry Department, University of Sadat City, Monufia, Egypt."}], "LastName": "El-Kashlan", "ForeName": "Akram M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Animal and Poultry Management and Wealth Development Department, Beni-Suef University, Beni-Suef, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Emeash", "ForeName": "H H", "Initials": "HH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Animal and Poultry Management and Wealth Development Department, Beni-Suef University, Beni-Suef, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Khalil", "ForeName": "Fatma", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomarkers", "NlmUniqueID": "9606000", "ISSNLinking": "1354-750X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "DL48G20X8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Scopolamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Scopolamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maze Learning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35950787", "10.1080/1354750X.2022.2112975"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
