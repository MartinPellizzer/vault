The samples of medicinal plants and soils were collected from Osukuru, Tororo District (Uganda). The naturally occurring radionuclides investigated were <sup>226</sup>Ra, <sup>232</sup>Th and <sup>40</sup>K and their activity concentrations were determined using NaI gamma detector. In the medicinal plants, the average activity concentrations of <sup>226</sup>Ra, <sup>232</sup>Th and <sup>40</sup>K were found to be 6.04 Bq/kg, 9.65 Bq/kg and 359.59 Bq/kg respectively. African Basil registered the highest activity concentration of <sup>226</sup>Ra of 10.02 Bq/kg, spider plant had the highest activity concentration of <sup>232</sup>Th of 18.60 Bq/kg whereas the pumpkin registered the highest activity concentrations of <sup>40</sup>K of 437.92 Bq/kg. The average activity concentrations of <sup>226</sup>Ra, <sup>232</sup>Th and <sup>40</sup>K in 'medicinal soils' were 68.87 Bq/kg, 78.20 Bq/kg and 477.44 Bq/kg respectively. The soils from the anthills registered the highest activity concentration of <sup>226</sup>Ra and <sup>40</sup>K while the one from bricks registered the highest activity concentration of <sup>232</sup>Th. The annual committed effective dose due to the ingestion of medicinal plants varied from 0.096 to 0.297\u00a0mSv/y with an average of 0.194 mSv/y in infants, 0.016-0.040 mSv/y with an average of 0.029 mSv/y for individuals of age range 12-17 years and 0.007-0.018 mSv/y with an average of 0.013 mSv/y for individuals older than 17 years. Whereas the annual committed effective dose due to the ingestion of 'medicinal soils' varied from 1.28 to 1.65 mSv/y with an average of 1.46 mSv/y in infants, 0.23-0.30 mSv/y with an average of 0.26 mSv/y (12-17 years) and 0.07-0.09 mSv/y with an average of 0.08 mSv/y for individuals older than 17 years. In medicinal plants, the annual committed effective dose for the all age groups examined were below 0.3 mSv/y (maximum world permissible as reported UNSCEAR, 2000) while that due to the ingestion of 'medicinal soils' had values higher 0.3 mSv/y in infants. The results of this study show that there is inherent danger to the infants in consuming soils during pregnancy and this should be discouraged."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
