It is found in several regions of the world, including China, but information about its genetic characteristics is limited. Here, we employed an improved method of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis (with increased RAMP time) to investigate the genetic link between G. jasminoides samples collected from six different regions of Southern China. Total 26 RAPD primers were selected randomly, among which 23 primers generated reproducible polymorphic amplification bands. A total of 174 bands were obtained, where each primer had amplified 5-13 bands with an average of 7.56 bands per primer. The band size ranged approximately 150-2200 bp. Cluster dendrogram was obtained based on the improved RAPD amplification profiles, which showed that the similarity coefficients among six varieties of G. jasminoides ranged 0.67-0.88. To our knowledge, this is the first report of genetic characterization of G. jasminoides using improved RAPD analysis, which may be useful for the preservation of genetic diversity and identification of Gardenia population."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mei", "ForeName": "Zhiqiang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Md Asaduzzaman", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Luquan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Manman", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Junjiang", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Agar Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Gardenia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Flow"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproductive Isolation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25872247"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
