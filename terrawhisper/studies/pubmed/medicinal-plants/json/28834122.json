Whereas some bitter chemicals are toxic and should not be ingested, other compounds exhibit health beneficial effects, which is manifest in the cross-cultural believe that the bitterness of medicine is correlated with the desired medicinal activity. The bitter taste receptors in the oral cavity serve as sensors for bitter compounds and, as they are expressed in numerous extraoral tissues throughout the body, may also be responsible for some physiological effects exerted by bitter compounds. Chinese herbal medicine uses bitter herbs since ancient times for the treatment of various diseases; however, the routes by which these herbs modify physiology are frequently not well understood. We therefore screened 26 bitter substances extracted from medical herbs for the activation of the 25 human bitter taste receptors. We identified six receptors activated by in total 17 different bitter compounds. Interestingly, we observed a bias in bitter taste receptor activation with 10 newly identified agonists for the broadly tuned receptor TAS2R46, seven agonists activating the TAS2R14 and two compounds activating narrowly tuned receptors, suggesting that these receptors play dominant roles in the evaluation and perhaps physiological activities of Chinese herbal medicines."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2082-8860"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics, German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbruecke, Nuthetal, Germany."}], "LastName": "Behrens", "ForeName": "Maik", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Drug Discovery Lab, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Drug Discovery Lab, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Shengjie", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Drug Discovery Lab, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Cheng", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics, German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbruecke, Nuthetal, Germany."}], "LastName": "Meyerhof", "ForeName": "Wolfgang", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biol Drug Des", "NlmUniqueID": "101262549", "ISSNLinking": "1747-0277"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoid Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "picfeltarraenone I"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "taste receptors, type 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2O4553545L", "NameOfSubstance": "oleuropein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HEK293 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iridoid Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Iridoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28834122", "10.1111/cbdd.13089"]}}]}
