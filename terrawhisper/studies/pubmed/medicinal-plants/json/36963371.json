Pharmaceutical inhibition of ROR1 and Aurora kinase abrogated the activation of downstream signaling and induced cancer cell apoptosis. Hence, ROR1 and Aurora kinase considered as attractive therapeutic targets for the development of anticancer drugs. In the present work, three series of novel 6-(imidazo[1,2-a] pyridin-6-yl)-quinazolin-4(3H)-one derivatives were designed and synthesized via bioisosterism and scaffold-hopping strategies guided by FLF-13, an Aurora kinase inhibitor we discovered earlier. Most of compounds in series 2 and series 3 showed submicromolar to nanomolar inhibitory activity against multiple cancer cell lines. More importantly, compounds 12d and 12f in series 3 showed nanomolar inhibitory activity against all test cancer cells. The most promising compound 12d exhibited potent inhibitory activity against Aurora A and Aurora B with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 84.41\u00a0nM and 14.09\u00a0nM, respectively. Accordingly, compounds 12d induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest at 24\u00a0h and polyploidy at 48\u00a0h. It's worth noting that 12d also displayed inhibitory activity against ROR1 and induce cell apoptosis. Furthermore, 12d could significantly inhibit the tumor growth in SH-SY5Y xenograft model with tumor growth inhibitory rate (IR) up to 46.31\u00a0% at 10\u00a0mg/kg and 52.66\u00a0% at 20\u00a0mg/kg. Overall, our data suggested that 12d might serve as a promising candidate for the development of therapeutic agents for cancers with aberrant expression of ROR1 and Aurora kinases by simultaneously targeting ROR1 and Aurora kinase."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
