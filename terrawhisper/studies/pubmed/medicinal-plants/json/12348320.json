Since people with STDs are at greater risk of contracting and transmitting HIV than are those without STDs, THs comprise a good target group for HIV/AIDS education. A study was funded by the Scandinavian Institute of African Studies in which THs in Amatikulu, Ulundi, Nqutu, Durban, Pietermaritzburg, and other adjacent areas were surveyed about their HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, beliefs, and practices. Most AIDS-educated THs now acknowledge that AIDS exists and are taking protective measures, such as using disposable razor blades to avoid infecting patients with HIV during traditional treatments. However, many THs believe that AIDS has evolved from older, mystical diseases which only THs can cure. Traditional hospitals have proliferated in which HIV/AIDS patients seek treatment from what is more typically perceived by the THs and the general public as morbidity due to witchcraft and other spiritual causes. While each TH has his own blend of medicine against AIDS, the basic ingredients are common among all concoctions. One basic, common ingredient is a plant with documented anti-viral and anti-AIDS properties. The plant, however, is highly toxic and will itself kill the patient after a few days treatment. Another plant has considerable virucidal activity against several RNA and DNA attacking viruses. The traditional medicine was also found to contain plants which have traditionally been used against headaches, respiratory problems, chest and abdominal pains, colds, and dysentery. It also has documented antifungal and antimicrobial effects against common opportunistic infections, as well as being a sedative and painkiller. Traditional treatments against AIDS may help to improve patients' well-being."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "KeywordList": [["Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome", "Africa", "Africa South Of The Sahara", "Behavior", "Beliefs", "Culture", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Diseases", "English Speaking Africa", "Health", "Health Facilities", "Health Services", "Hiv Infections", "Hospitals", "Knowledge", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Plants, Medicinal", "Research Report", "Risk Reduction Behavior", "South Africa", "Southern Africa", "Treatment", "Viral Diseases"]], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: AIDS ANALYSIS AFRICA"], "PMID": "12348320", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1998", "Month": "06", "Day": "02"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2005", "Month": "05", "Day": "11"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [], "Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1016-8974", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "7", "Issue": "6", "PubDate": {"Year": "1997", "Month": "Dec"}}, "Title": "AIDS analysis Africa", "ISOAbbreviation": "AIDS Anal Afr"}, "ArticleTitle": "Traditional healers, traditional hospitals and HIV / AIDS: a case study in KwaZulu-Natal.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "10", "EndPage": "12", "MedlinePgn": "10-2"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Munk", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "South Africa", "MedlineTA": "AIDS Anal Afr", "NlmUniqueID": "101085246", "ISSNLinking": "1016-8974"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa South of the Sahara"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa, Southern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HIV Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Facilities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Knowledge"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Therapeutics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virus Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12348320"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
