The results showed that GP could inhibit the UV induction of bacteriophage lambda in lysogenic cells. The inhibitory effects were dependent on the concentration and the reaction time of GP, and were efficient at 40 to approximately 125 microg ml(-1) for 10 min. The inhibitory rate was higher than 70% when the GP concentration was 50 microg ml(-1). By electron spin resonance (ESR) and spin-trapping techniques, the signals of free radicals were detected in the suspension of the lambda lysogenic bacteria induced by ultraviolet irradiation, but after the addition of GP the signals were decreased. These results indicate that gynostemma pentaphyllum not only is a scavenger of free radicals, but also possesses the biological function of anti-irradiation, and that there is a close relation between the UV irradiation of the bacteriaphage lambda and free radicals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Curr Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7808448", "ISSNLinking": "0343-8651"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteriophage lambda"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gynostemma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lysogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Activation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11683367", "10.1007/s002840010305"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
