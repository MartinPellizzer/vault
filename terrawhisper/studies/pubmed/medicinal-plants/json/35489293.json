The odour compound of Periploca sepium Bunge, named 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-benzaldehyde (HMB), is a herbicidal compound. However, its herbicidal mechanism is unclear. In this experiment, the physiological and biochemical indices, ultrastructure, and photosynthetic function of the leaves of Humulus scandens (Lour.) Merr. treated by HMB were assessed to elucidate the herbicidal mechanism. The results of physiological and biochemical indices are as follows: First, after 4\u00a0h of treatment with 2.5 and 5.0\u00a0mg/mL, the damage rates in the membrane permeation assay were 74.7% and 89.1%, respectively. Second, compared to the negative control group, multiple physiological and biochemical indices of the two treated groups were changed, including catalase content (-18.5 and -26.5\u00a0ng/mL), superoxide dismutase content (-27.4 and -56.6\u00a0ng/mL), peroxidase content (382.0 and 880.0\u00a0ng/mL), reactive oxygen species content (16.7 and 27.2\u00a0ng/mL), malondialdehyde content (8.9 and 25.2 nmol/g), and water potential values (0.2 and 0.3\u00a0MPa), except for the photosynthetic pigment contents (chlorophyll a, b, and carotene). Furthermore, the results of transmission electron microscopy showed that the organelles in the mesophyll tissue cells disappeared and severe plasmolysis led to cell atrophy after 4\u00a0h of treatment. There were fewer starch granules after 24\u00a0h of treatment, but there was no obvious abnormality in the upper and lower epidermal cells. The results of photosynthetic function showed that in the light response, the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance (Gs), and stomatal limitation value of the tested leaves were lower than those of the negative control group by 26.6 \u03bcmol\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup>, 7.7\u00a0mmol\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup>, 0.9\u00a0mol\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup>, and 0.2, respectively. However, the intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (Ci) increased and was higher than the air CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. In the CO<sub>2</sub> response, the Pn, Tr and Gs of the tested leaves first increased and then decreased, but the Ci value continuously increased and finally reached 1727.5 \u03bcmol\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup>. It is obvious that HMB may have inhibited the effect on the photosynthetic system of the tested leaves. Overall, HMB killed the weeds by destroying the structure and multiple physiological functions of the tested leaves."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
