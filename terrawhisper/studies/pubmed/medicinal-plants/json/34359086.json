The goal of this review was to systematically identify plant species and evaluate their potential in prophylaxis and therapy of common diseases in poultry caused by bacteria and gastrointestinal protozoa. The procedure followed the recommendations of the PRISMA statement and the AMSTAR measurement tool. The PICOS scheme was used to design the research questions. Two databases were consulted, and publications were manually selected, according to predefined in- and exclusion criteria. A scoring system was established to evaluate the remaining publications. Initially, 4197 identified publications were found, and 77 publications remained after manual sorting, including 38 publications with 70 experiments on bacterial infections and 39 publications with 78 experiments on gastrointestinal protozoa. In total, 83 plant species from 42 families were identified. Asteraceae and Lamiaceae were the most frequently found families with <i>Artemisia annua</i> being the most frequently found plant, followed by <i>Origanum vulgare</i>. As compared to placebo and positive or negative control groups, antimicrobial effects were found in 46 experiments, prebiotic effects in 19 experiments, and antiprotozoal effects in 47 experiments. In summary, a total of 274 positive effects predominated over 241 zero effects and 37 negative effects. Data indicate that <i>O. vulgare, Coriandrum sativum, A.\u00a0annua,</i> and <i>Bidens pilosa</i> are promising plant species for prophylaxis and therapy of bacterial and protozoal diseases in poultry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Thieme.
