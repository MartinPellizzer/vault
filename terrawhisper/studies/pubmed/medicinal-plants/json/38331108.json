Arenobufagin, a compound derived from Bufo viridis toad venom, has demonstrated the ability to inhibit cell growth in various cancer cell lines. However, our understanding of the role and mechanism of arenobufagin in lung cancer remains incomplete, necessitating further researches to fully elucidate its action mechanism. In this study, we further explored the impact of arenobufagin on A549\u00a0cells. The results revealed that it exerted a potent cytotoxic effect on A549\u00a0cells by inhibiting cell colony formation, promoting cell apoptosis, increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and arresting A549\u00a0cells in G2/M phase. Collectively, our findings suggested that arenobufagin may have potential as a future therapeutic for lung cancer treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
