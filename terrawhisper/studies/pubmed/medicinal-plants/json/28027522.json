For the preparation of corilagin-MIP monoliths, 4-vinylpyridine was used as functional monomer, and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate was used as cross-linking monomer, using a mixture of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazoliumtetrafluoroborate (ionic liquid)-N,N-dimethylformamide-dimethyl sulfoxide as a porogen. A morphological characteristic of the corilagin imprinted monolith was further studied by scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen sorption method. The greatest imprinting factor of COR was up to 9. The MIPs were used as solid-phase extraction (SPE) sorbents for purification of COR and the mean recoveries of corilagin was 78.0% with COR purity of 98.0% from the crude extract of phyllanthus urinaria L. The resulting COR-imprinted polymer also displayed the good performance of fragment imprinting polymer for gallic acid with the mean recoveries of 94.0% and purity of 99.7%."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
