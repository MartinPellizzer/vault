They are curcumin, demethoxycurcumin (DMC), and bisdemethoxycurcumin. While curcumin has been the most extensively studied of the curcuminoids, it suffers from low overall oral bioavailability due to extremely low absorption as a result of low water solubility and instability at acidic pH, as well as rapid metabolism and clearance from the body. However, DMC, which lacks the methoxy group on the benzene ring of the parent structure, has much greater chemical stability at physiological pH and has been recently reported to exhibit antitumor properties. However, the treatment of noncancerous diseases with DMC has not been comprehensively reviewed. Therefore, here we evaluate published scientific literature on the therapeutic properties of DMC. The beneficial pharmacological actions of DMC include anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antihypertensive, antimalarial, antimicrobial, antifungal, and vasodilatory properties. In addition, DMC's ability to ameliorate the effects of free radicals and an environment characterized by oxidative stress caused by the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products associated with diabetic nephropathy, as well as DMC's capacity to inhibit the migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells following balloon angioplasty are also addressed. This review collates the available literature regarding the therapeutic possibilities of DMC in noncancerous conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanotechnology Research Center, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hatamipour", "ForeName": "Mahdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ramezani", "ForeName": "Mahin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tabassi", "ForeName": "Sayyed Abolghasem Sajadi", "Initials": "SAS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri."}], "LastName": "Johnston", "ForeName": "Thomas P", "Initials": "TP"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8656-1444"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sahebkar", "ForeName": "Amirhossein", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0050222", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9541"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diarylheptanoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycation End Products, Advanced"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IT942ZTH98", "NameOfSubstance": "Curcumin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "W2F8059T80", "NameOfSubstance": "demethoxycurcumin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Curcumin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Nephropathies"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Diarylheptanoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Glycation End Products, Advanced"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31344992", "10.1002/jcp.28626"]}}]}
