The fibres were desorbed at 200 degrees C for programmed gas chromatography (40-187 degrees C) on a methyl polysiloxane capillary. Substances were identified by mass spectra and/or authentic sample retention. Results do not correspond to published values for steam distilled oils, being richer in sesquiterpenes, of which three are common to three different species; and also in esters in two species. Five Eucalyptus citriodora leaves from the same tree over different months gave very similar analyses to a fibre in 10 min of 72.9-80.5% citronellal, 3.5-5.4% citronellol, 1.0-3.8% citronellyl acetate, 9.2-11.8% caryophyllene and 1.4-1.7% bicyclogermacrene. Six E. nicholii leaves yielded 67.2-73.7% cineole and 4.6-9.7% limonene along with 10.5-16.5% sesquiterpenes, mostly hydrocarbons, particularly bicyclogermacrene. E. globulus leaves gave only 54.0-61.3% cineole, with 19.5-24.3% alpha-pinene, 6.7-9.1% limonene and 2.1-5.4% alpha-terpinyl acetate; along with 3.6-7.7% sesquiterpenes, particularly aromadendrene, but no bicyclogermacrene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Betts", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Letter"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Eucalyptus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10763604", "10.1055/s-0029-1243133"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
