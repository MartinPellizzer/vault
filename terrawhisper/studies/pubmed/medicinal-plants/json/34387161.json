Laxatives are used for the treatment or management of chronic/acute constipation. But due to the adverse effects associated with these laxatives, herbal foods should be considered as alternative therapies for constipation. In this review, the laxative potential of plant-based medicines used for constipation is discussed. Constipation may be caused by various factors such as lifestyle, particular food habits, pregnancy and even due to some medication. Chronic constipation is responsible for different health issues. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological paradigms are applied for the treatment or management of constipation. In the pharmacological way of treatment, medicinal plants have a key role because of their fibrous nature. Numerous plants such as Prunus persica (Rosaceae), Cyamopsis tetragonolobus (Leguminosae), Citrus sinensis (Rutaceae), Planta goovata (Plantaginaceae), Rheum emodi (Polygonaceae), Cassia auriculata (Caesalpinacea), Ricinus communis (Euphorbiaceae), Croton tiglium (Euphorbiaceae), Aloe barbadensis (Liliaceae), Mareya micrantha (Euphorbiaceae), Euphorbia thymifolia (Euphorbiaceae), Cascara sagrada (Rhamnaceae), Cassia angustifolia (Fabaceae) have laxative activity. Medicinal plants possess a significant laxative potential and support their folklore; therefore, further, well-designed clinical-based studies are required to prove and improve the efficacy of herbal medicine for constipation. The present review showed that herbs laxative effect in various in vivo/ in vitro models."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine, Government College University Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akram", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Crop Science, College of Sanghuh Life Science, Konkuk University, Seoul, 05029, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Thiruvengadam", "ForeName": "Muthu", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine, Government College University Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Zainab", "ForeName": "Rida", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Eastern Medicine, Hamdard University, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Daniyal", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "African Centre of Excellence (World Bank) Public Health and Toxicological Research (ACE-PUTOR), University of Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Bankole", "ForeName": "Marc Moboladji", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "V.M.
