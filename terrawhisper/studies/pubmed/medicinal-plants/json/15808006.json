This method consists of extraction of the sample with MeOH-H2O (70:30) followed by clean-up of the extracts with immunoaffinity columns and, finally, high-performance liquid chromatographic determination with fluorescence detection. Aflatoxins B1 and G1 are determined as their bromine derivatives, produced in an online post-column derivatization system. The overall average recoveries for three different medicinal herbs spiked at levels of 1.3 and 2.6 ng/g of total aflatoxins range from 93% to 97%. The detection limit is 0.15 ng/g for both G2 and B2 and 0.20 ng/g for both G1 and B1, based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1 and a precision (within-laboratory relative standard deviation) ranging from 0.8% to 1.4%. The use of immunoaffinity columns provides excellent clean-up of these particular extracts, which are generally difficult to analyze. The method is applied successfully to 96 samples of natural drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Xibeiwang, Haidian district, Beijing 100094, China. xuehui_z@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xuehui", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Huiling", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jianmin", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0173225", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9665"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1DB78J7PUD", "NameOfSubstance": "aflatoxin G1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9N2N2Y55MH", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxin B1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SBV4XY874G", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxin B1"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bromine"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Affinity"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunologic Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15808006", "10.1093/chromsci/43.1.47"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
