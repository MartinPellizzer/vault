Petals of Echium amoenum (Gole-Gavzaban) is one of the most valuable medicinal plants in Iranian folk medicine. The dry petals of E. amoenum have long been used as a sedative, tonic, anxiolytic and as a treatment for sore throat, cough and inflammation. Previous studies have shown that petals of E. amoenum contain four toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids but conflicting results have been acquired in experimental studies investigating the hepatotoxicy of E. amoenum. However, the direct effect of E. amoenum on liver cells and the complete mechanisms of its possible cytotoxic effects toward these cells remain to be defined. The main aim of this study was to assay the mechanisms underlying the toxic effects of E. amoenum toward hepG2 cells. E. amoenum extract was obtained by infusion of dried petals in hot water (90 centigrade) for 15 or 30\u00a0min. Cell viability and mechanistic parameters were determined following 12\u00a0h incubation of hepG2 with E. amoenum extract that was obtained after 15 or 30\u00a0min infusion. The results indicated that E. amoenum extract exerts cytotoxic effects on hepG2 cells, probably through mitochondrial and lysosomal damage induced by glutathione depletion and oxidative stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
