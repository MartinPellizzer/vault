Each differentiation by itself brings certain improvement and upgrading but at any level, this happens only when proper conditions are met. Therefore, in order for pharmacy to appear as a profession and to promoted to the level of science, certain conditions had to be met, namely the society and cultural forces had matured to the level of differentiation of these two disciplines, which have begun existing as completely independent disciplines in that time. For the history of pharmacy, it is very important to note the fact that we find the first beginnings of professional pharmacy among Arabic population. The first drug stores in the world were established in Arabic world (Baghdad 754). Considering the fact that Arabs had brought a great deal to pharmaceutical science and the fact that their search included some 2.000 substances, the goal of this work was formulated and medicinal herbs used in the treatment listed. The forms used that period are still used in the therapy and some formulations of drugs can be found in pharmacopeas even today. If we add to these reports the fact that most of the literature appearing in the field was also of Arabic origin and that many editions and translations of the pharmaceutical works from Arabic to Latin had been published ever since, the obvious contribution of Arabic science in the development of pharmacy becomes even more obvious."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hadzovi\u0107", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Farmacija i veliki doprinos Arapske islamske znanosti u njenom razvitku."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Bosnia and Herzegovina", "MedlineTA": "Med Arh", "NlmUniqueID": "0400722", "ISSNLinking": "0350-199X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Arab World"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History of Pharmacy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Medieval"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Arabic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9324574"]}}]}
