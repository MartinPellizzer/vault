Its role in developing certain cancers, particularly gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), makes it an attractive therapeutic target. Several small molecule inhibitors targeting c-Kit have been developed and approved for clinical use. Recent studies have focused on identifying and optimizing natural compounds as c-Kit inhibitors employing virtual screening. Still, drug resistance, off-target side effects, and variability in patient response remain significant challenges. From this perspective, phytochemicals could be an important resource for discovering novel c-Kit inhibitors with less toxicity, improved efficacy, and high specificity. This study aimed to uncover possible c-Kit inhibitors by utilizing a structure-based virtual screening of active phytoconstituents from Indian medicinal plants. Through the screening stages, two promising candidates, Anilinonaphthalene and Licoflavonol, were chosen based on their drug-like features and ability to bind to c-Kit. These chosen candidates were subjected to all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to evaluate their stability and interaction with c-Kit. The selected compounds Anilinonaphthalene from <i>Daucus carota</i> and Licoflavonol from <i>Glycyrrhiza glabra</i> showed their potential to act as selective binding partners of c-Kit. Our results suggest that the identified phytoconstituents could serve as a starting point to develop novel c-Kit inhibitors for developing new and effective therapies against multiple cancers, including GISTs and AML. The use of virtual screening and MD simulations provides a rational approach to discovering potential drug candidates from natural sources.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
