Germination of peony seeds requires warm stratification for embryo growth and radicle protrusion followed by cold stratification for epicotyl growth. The genus Paeonia (Paeoniaceae) includes many popular ornamentals, has colorful flowers and contains several Chinese medicinal species. The germination protocol for seeds of Paeonia species is complex and impedes the breeding of new cultivars and contributes to the rarity and high cost of the plants. Although numerous reports on seed dormancy/germination in peonies are scattered throughout the literature, most of them are in Chinese. The primary aims of this paper are to provide a general overview of the available information on seed dormancy/germination in peonies and to make some suggestions regarding propagation for the peony industry and breeders. Most Paeonia species have epicotyl dormancy. The embryo is differentiated into organs, but it is underdeveloped (small) and must grow inside the seed before the radicle can emerge. Germination of peony seeds requires warm stratification for embryo growth and radicle protrusion followed by cold stratification for epicotyl growth. In addition, the epicotyl is sensitive to cold stratification only after the root has grown to a certain length. GA<sub>3</sub> treatment enhances embryo growth and subsequent germination percentages. Further investigations on the physiology, genetics and proteomics would contribute to a better understanding of seed dormancy in Paeonia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology, College of Horticulture and Plant Protection, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Keliang", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology, College of Horticulture and Plant Protection, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Linjun", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology, College of Horticulture and Plant Protection, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, 40506, USA."}], "LastName": "Baskin", "ForeName": "Jerry M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, 40506, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, 40546, USA."}], "LastName": "Baskin", "ForeName": "Carol C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology, College of Horticulture and Plant Protection, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangling College, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Zuoming", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3845-3593"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology, College of Horticulture and Plant Protection, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, People's Republic of China. taojun@yzu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2017023", "Agency": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Horticultural Crop Genetic Improvement of P.
