Proper intake of an alimental vasodilator as a food additive may be a promising strategy for prevention and treatment of coronary spasmodic disorders.", "TMEM16A-encoded anoctamin 1 (ANO1), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel (CaCC), plays an important role in the modulation of vascular tone. We tested the possibility that inhibition of CaCCs contributes to chrysin-induced coronary arterial relaxation.", "The vascular tone of the rat coronary artery (RCA) was recorded with a wire myograph. CaCC currents were assessed using whole-cell patch clamp in arterial smooth muscle cell (ASMC) freshly isolated from RCAs. An inhibitor study was performed to explore the mechanisms underlying the vasomotor and electrophysiological effects of chrysin.", "Pre-incubation with chrysin depressed the contractions elicited by thromboxane A2 analog U46619, vasopressin (VP), depolarization and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation/depolarization without significant preference among these vasoconstrictors. Besides, chrysin inhibited both intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-dependent and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-dependent components of contractions induced by U46619 or VP. In RCAs pre-contracted with U46619, VP or KCl, chrysin elicited concentration-dependent relaxations, which were weakened by Cl<sup>-</sup> -deprivation. The electrophysiological study showed that chrysin reduced ANO1-antibody-sensitive CaCC currents and depressed CaCC increments induced by U46619. Inhibitor study showed that both the vasorelaxation and the CaCC current reduction induced by chrysin were attenuated by blocking CaCCs and inhibiting cAMP/PKA and NO/PKG pathways.", "The present findings indicate that inhibition of RCA ASMC CaCC currents, which may be consequential following intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability reduction and activation of cAMP/PKA and NO/cGMP signaling pathways, contributes to chrysin-induced RCA relaxation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
