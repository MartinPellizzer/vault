Iron, manganese, copper, and zinc are essential nutrient elements and required for balanced growth and development of plants, but chromium uptake sometimes disturbed their concentration in plants. Therefore, in the present paper, an effort has been made to observe the effect of different levels of Cr on nutrient uptake of Phyllanthus amarus and Solanum nigrum, the medicinally important plants of indigenous systems of medicine having hepatoprotective and diuretic properties. The study revealed that Cr causes significant changes in nutrient uptake as compared to control plants. Besides, Cr-treated plants showed growth depression and decrease in fresh and dry weight too. With the increase in Cr supply, accumulation of Cr in roots was increased significantly. Concentration of manganese and zinc was also increased. However, copper concentration in both the plants seemed less affected by Cr."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy and Ethnopharmacology Division, National Botanical Research Institute, Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow 226001, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rai", "ForeName": "Vartika", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khatoon", "ForeName": "Sayyada", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rawat", "ForeName": "A K S", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mehrotra", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biol Trace Elem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7911509", "ISSNLinking": "0163-4984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0R0008Q3JB", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42Z2K6ZL8P", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J41CSQ7QDS", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chromium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Manganese"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phyllanthus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum nigrum"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Zinc"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17916964", "10.1007/s12011-007-0071-3", "BTER:120:1-3:127"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
