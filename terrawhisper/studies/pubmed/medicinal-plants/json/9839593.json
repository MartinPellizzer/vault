Isometric tension changes, recorded with a pressure transducer, in response to various drugs and electrical stimulation were assessed in an organ chamber, after active muscle tone had been induced by 10 micromol/L phenylephrine.", "GCS (0.2-8.0 mg) relaxed the smooth muscle of rabbit corpus cavernosum (SMRCC) pre-contracted with phenylephrine in a dose-dependent manner. GCS at 0.75 mg significantly enhanced the relaxation of SMRCC induced by electrical field stimulation. The relaxation induced by 0.2-8.0 mg GCS was significantly attenuated by atropine (1 micromol/L), methylene blue (100 micromol/L) and N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10 micromol/L). However, there was no significant difference in the attenuation of GCS-induced relaxation of SMRCC by adding vasoactive intestinal peptide antagonists or indomethacin. In addition, the decreasing rate of GCS-induced relaxation of SMRCC by methylene blue and L-NAME was greater than that by atropine. L-arginine (10 mmol/L) reversed the inhibitory effect induced by L-NAME (1 mmol/L) on the attenuation of GCS-induced relaxation.", "These data suggest that GCS, as a nitric oxide donor, induces the relaxation of SMRCC through the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway.
