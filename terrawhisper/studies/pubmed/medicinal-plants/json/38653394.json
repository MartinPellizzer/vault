Korth is traditionally used in Manipur, India for treatment of diabetes and hypertension. However, there is no data reported regarding safety profile of this medicinal plant upon repeated per oral administration over a period of time.", "In the current study phytochemical profile, toxicological profile and total phenolic and flavonoid compound content of Schima wallichii leaves extract were evaluated.", "Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was performed for chemical profiling by using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS/MS), Shimadzu, TQ8040 system. A 28 days sub-acute toxicity study was carried out using albino Wistar rats by administering 3 different doses (200, 400 and 800\u00a0mg/kg body weight per oral) of methanol leaves extract. Changes in body weights were recorded weekly. Serum biochemical parameters were estimated as well as blood-cell count was done to check the effect of extract on haematopoietic system. Histopathology of vital organs viz. kidney, heart, brain, liver was performed to find any pathological indications. Since, liver is main the site for xenobiotic metabolism, estimation of the level of glutathione, catalase and lipid peroxidation were done. Further, total phenolic and flavonoid compound content estimation was performed for the leaves extract.", "GC-MS revealed 14 major compounds with area percentage >1% of which quinic acid, n-Hexadecanoic acid, 9,12,15-Octadecatrienoic acid, (Z,Z,Z)-, Octatriacontyl trifluoroacetate, are three major compounds. No mortality was observed after the treatment with extract. Blood-cell count and biochemical parameters didn't show significant deviation as compared to control group. Histopathology study of vital organs viz. (liver, kidney, heart and brain) showed normal cellular construction comparing to control group. There was no sign of membrane lipid peroxidation, depletion of catalase level and glutathione level in liver. The result demonstrates that NOAEL (no-observed-adverse-effect levels) in the sub-acute toxicity was above 800\u00a0mg/kg. The leaves extract showed significant total phenol and flavonoid content.", "The present study revealed that Schima wallichii possessed important bioactive compounds with therapeutic values. The plant was safe for consumption after repeated high doses administration in rats and possesses significant amount of total phenol and flavonoid content."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
