All patients had a history of using facial dressings with steamed leaves of Piper betle L. (Piperaceae).", "Our purpose was to clarify the evolution and the origin of this unique leukomelanosis.", "Fifteen patients with an unusual pigmentary disorder, who visited our clinic in September and October 1997, were asked to complete a questionnaire designed to elicit the history related to the disorder. Eight of these 15 patients underwent skin biopsies: 6 on the mottled hyperpigmented area (group A) and 2 on the hypopigmented area (group B). All 8 specimens were prepared with hematoxylin-eosin, Masson-Fontana, and S-100 stains.", "The results of the questionnaire revealed that these patients had all experienced a temporary erythematous reaction in the first few days of the use of the facial dressing, and 9 of them also complained of an accompanying stinging sensation. A bleaching effect became noticeable approximately 1 week to 1 month later. Eight patients reported that the hyperpigmentation and confetti-like hypopigmentation occurred after overexposure to the sun. In both groups, histopathologic examination revealed some melanophages in the dermis. Masson-Fontana staining of specimens from group A showed local interspersed depigmentation and hyperpigmentation in the basal epidermis and pigmentary incontinence in the dermis. This picture was different from the homogeneous depigmentation within basal epidermis in specimens from group B. In both groups, S-100 staining was negative for melanocytes in the depigmented area.", "The clinical course and histopathologic findings suggest that the evolution of this pigmentary disorder can be divided into 3 stages. The first stage is the immediate bleaching stage, when an irritant reaction is usually conspicuous. The second stage consists of prominent hyperpigmentation visible both grossly and microscopically. The final stage is characterized by confetti-like depigmentation. It may be induced by chemicals in the betel leaves such as phenol, catechol, and benzene derivatives, perhaps through inhibition of melanin synthesis or melanocytotoxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Provincial Taoyuan Hospital, Taiwan, ROC."}], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Y L", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chiang", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "T F", "Initials": "TF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "R F", "Initials": "RF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hsiao", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Acad Dermatol", "NlmUniqueID": "7907132", "ISSNLinking": "0190-9622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dermatologic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bandages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biopsy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis, Contact"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis, Irritant"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis, Phototoxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatologic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Facial Dermatoses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pigmentation Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10188678", "10.1016/s0190-9622(99)70441-x", "S0190-9622(99)70441-X"]}}]}
