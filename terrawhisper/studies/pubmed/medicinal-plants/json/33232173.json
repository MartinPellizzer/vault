The results indicated that the wild mint showed seasonal fluctuations in accumulation potential for heavy metals proved by bioaccumulation factor (BF) and translocation factor (TF). The all measured heavy metals, except Pb were retained in the underground parts. Summer plants accumulated the highest concentrations of Al, Cd, Cr and Fe in their root, while the lowest concentration of Ni in their shoot. The bioaccumulation factor for Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn and Co was greater than one, while the translocation factor of the investigated metals (except Pb) did not exceed one, indicating the potential of wild mint for phytostabilization of these metals in contaminated wetlands. The yield and composition of mint essential oil (MEO) were affected by harvesting season and heavy metals pollution. GC/MS showed that isomenthone, cis-piperitenone oxide, menthone and pulegone, were the main oil constituents. Mint essential oil show promising antioxidant activity by 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay under pollution stress. The maximum reducing power of MEO were obtained during autumn and summer seasons (polluted canals).In conclusion, summer is the ideal season for harvesting wild mint plants for the maximum plant biomass, oil yield, high radical scavenging activity of MEO and to monitor pollution in contaminated wetlands."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botany and Microbiology Department, Faculty of Science, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Gharib", "ForeName": "Fatma A", "Initials": "FA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botany and Microbiology Department, Faculty of Science, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mansour", "ForeName": "Khaled H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botany and Microbiology Department, Faculty of Science, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Eman Z", "Initials": "EZ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9847-1051"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botany and Microbiology Department, Faculty of Science, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biology Department, College of Sciences, Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Galal", "ForeName": "Tarek M", "Initials": "TM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Phytoremediation", "NlmUniqueID": "101136878", "ISSNLinking": "1522-6514"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Egypt"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mentha"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33232173", "10.1080/15226514.2020.1847035"]}}]}
