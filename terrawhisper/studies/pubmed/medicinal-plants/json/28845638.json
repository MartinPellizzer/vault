Morphology and molecular biology methods were applied to indentify the endophyte strains. And methods of growth rate and filtering paper were also used for studying antibacterial/antifungal effects of the strains. As a result, 129 endophyte strains were isolated. Fifty-eight endophytic fungi strains were identified as 6 species in 4 genera and the dominant genus was Fusarium. Seventy-one endophytic bacteria strains were identified as 9 species in 3 genera and the dominant genus was Bacillus. Inhibitory diameter with endophytic fermenting liquid of Pseudomonas chlororaphis, F. nematophilum and B. megaterium from P. suffruticosa against Staphyloccocus aureus, Escherichia coli and B. subtilis reached 25.0,20.2,24.0 mm respectively. The inhibition rate of endophytic fermenting liquid from F. nematophilum against Penicillium sp. and Colletotrichum dematium reached 90.6% and 83.3%, respectively. The inhibition effect of P. chlororaphis against F. oxysporum f. sp. niveum and Mucor sp. was good and the antifungal rate reached 80.0% and 84.9%, respectively. P. suffruticosa in Tongling region contains abundant endophytes. P. chlororaphis and F. nematophilum are valuable species as starting strain about microbicide."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences/Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources, Anhui Normal University, Anhui Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine Daily Supplies, Wuhu 241000, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences/Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources, Anhui Normal University, Anhui Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine Daily Supplies, Wuhu 241000, China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Jing-Jing", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences/Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources, Anhui Normal University, Anhui Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine Daily Supplies, Wuhu 241000, China."}], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Yu-Xin", "Initials": "YX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences/Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources, Anhui Normal University, Anhui Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine Daily Supplies, Wuhu 241000, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Ying-Ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences/Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources, Anhui Normal University, Anhui Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine Daily Supplies, Wuhu 241000, China."}], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "Qing-Qing", "Initials": "QQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibiosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics", "isolation & purification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Paeonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28845638", "10.4268/cjcmm20160109"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
