Tests of the optimal hormonal composition of the medium from the standpoint of the growth of cultures revealed that the highest growth in biomass was achieved in the medium with an addition of 2.4-D (0.1, 1.0 mg.l-1), NAA (10.0 mg.l-1), and a combination of IAA (1.0 mg.l-1) + K (1.0 mg.l-1). The difference between these values was statistically insignificant. Other tested concentrations of growth regulators showed statistically significantly lower increases. The effects of different types of growth regulators and their concentrations on the production of selected metabolites in the tissue cultures were also examined and compared with the results obtained from the extract of the drug. Of alkaloids, stachydrine was demonstrated both in the extract of the drug and the extracts from all tested calluses regardless of the type and concentration of the growth regulator. Of flavonoid substances, two stains were demonstrated in the extract from the drug as well as in the extracts from all tested calluses. Neither of them was identical with the employed standards of rutin and quercetin. The results of TLC of iridoid substances were different in the extract from the drug (12 stains) and in the extracts from calluses (4 stains--3 identical with the stains in the extract from the drug). As to saccharides, three of them--glucose, fructose, and sucrose--were identified in the extract of the drug as well as in the extracts from all calluses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Katedra farmaceutick\u00e9 botaniky a ekologie Farmaceutick\u00e9 fakulty Univerzity Karlovy, Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9. duskova@faf.cuni.cz"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duskov\u00e1", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dusek", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Leonurus cardiaca in vitro."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Czech Republic", "MedlineTA": "Ceska Slov Farm", "NlmUniqueID": "9433765", "ISSNLinking": "1210-7816"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Leonurus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Structures"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15065396"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
