Plasma cholesterol of rabbits fed a 1% cholesterol-enriched diet for 6 wk was not reduced by supplementation with 800 microL Kyolic/(kg body. d). In spite of this, Kyolic reduced by 64% (P < 0.05) the surface area of the thoracic aorta covered by fatty streaks and significantly reduced aortic arch cholesterol. Kyolic also significantly inhibited by approximately 50% the development of thickened, lipid-filled lesions in preformed neointimas produced by Fogarty 2F balloon catheter injury of the right carotid artery in cholesterol-fed rabbits. In vitro studies found that Kyolic completely prevented vascular smooth muscle phenotypic change from the contractile, high volume fraction of filament (V(v)myo) state, and inhibited proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the synthetic state with a 50% effective dose (ED(50)) of 0.2%. Kyolic also slightly inhibited the accumulation of lipid in cultured macrophages but not smooth muscle, and had no effect on the expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of the endothelium or the adherence of leukocytes. It is concluded that Kyolic exerts antiatherogenic effects through inhibition of smooth muscle phenotypic change and proliferation, and by another (unclarified) effect on lipid accumulation in the artery wall."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Research in Vascular Biology, Department of Anatomical Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland 4072 Australia. julie.campbell@mailbox.uq.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Campbell", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Efendy", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "N J", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Campbell", "ForeName": "G R", "Initials": "GR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticholesteremic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anticholesteremic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Aorta, Thoracic"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Arteriosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Carotid Arteries"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Catheterization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelium, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescent Antibody Technique"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maximum Tolerated Dose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Smooth, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11238806", "10.1093/jn/131.3.1006S"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
