R. Br. ex DC., Eryngium foetidum L., and Stephania japonica (Thunb.) Miers plants are traditionally used to treat various central nervous system disorders like paralysis, epilepsy, seizure, convulsion, chronic pain, headache, sleep disturbances, sprain, and mental disorders. However, their possible neuroprotective effects have not been evaluated experimentally so far.", "The study aims to examine the neuroprotective potential of the three plants against cytotoxicity induced by rotenone in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and assess its plausible mechanisms of neuroprotection.", "The antioxidant properties of the plant extracts were determined chemically by DPPH and ABTS assay methods. The cytotoxicity of rotenone and the cytoprotective activities of the extracts were evaluated using MTT assays. Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) expression studies in cells were performed to assess neuronal survival after rotenone and extract treatments. Mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species were evaluated using Rhodamine 123 and DCF-DA dye, respectively. Catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase activities were also measured. Apoptotic nuclei were examined using DAPI staining. Liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) analysis of the plant extracts was also performed.", "The methanol extracts of A. sessilis, S. japonica, and E. foetidum showed excellent free radical scavenging activities. MAP2 expression studies show that A. sessilis and S. japonica have higher neuroprotective effects against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells than E. foetidum. Pre-treating cells with the plant extracts reverses the rotenone-induced increase in intracellular ROS. The plant extracts could also restore the reduced mitochondrial membrane potential induced by rotenone treatment and reinstate rotenone-induced increases in catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase activities. All the extracts inhibited rotenone-induced changes in nuclear morphology and DNA condensation, an early event of cellular apoptosis. LC-QTOF-MS analysis of the plant extracts shows the presence of neuroprotective compounds.", "The plant extracts showed neuroprotective activities against rotenone-treated SH-SY5Y cells through antioxidant and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. These findings support the ethnopharmacological uses of these plants in treating neurological disorders. They probably are a good source of neuroprotective compounds that could be further explored to develop treatment strategies for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
