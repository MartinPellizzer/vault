The two proteins, designated alpha- and beta-antifungal proteins in accordance with their order of elution from the CM-Sepharose column, were capable of inhibiting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase and one of the glycohydrolases associated with HIV infection, alpha-glucosidase, but beta-glucuronidase was not repressed. The ability of the proteins in retarding mycelial growth of a variety of fungi was also demonstrated with alpha-antifungal protein being more potent in most of the cases. Beta-antifungal protein was more active in only one instance. Both antifungal proteins had low cell-free translation-inhibitory activity. The proteins were adsorbed on Affi-gel blue gel-and CM-Sepharose but could be separated from one another during chromatography on the latter medium by means of a linear NaCl concentration gradient. Different molecular weights were exhibited by the proteins, being 28 kDa and 12 kDa respectively for alpha- and beta- antifungal proteins. Alpha-antifungal protein was characterized by an N-terminal sequence showing close resemblance to sequences of chitinases. Beta-antifungal protein exhibited an N-terminal sequence hitherto unknown in the literature."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "X Y", "Initials": "XY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "H X", "Initials": "HX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ng", "ForeName": "T B", "Initials": "TB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375521", "ISSNLinking": "0024-3205"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-HIV Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.7.49", "NameOfSubstance": "HIV Reverse Transcriptase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-HIV Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "HIV Reverse Transcriptase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "HIV-1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11191627", "10.1016/s0024-3205(00)00905-x", "S002432050000905X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
