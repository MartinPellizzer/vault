Identifying medicinal plants sold on markets is challenging, as leaves, barks and roots are often fragmented or powdered. Vernacular names are often homonymic, and identification of material lacking sufficient morphological characters is time-consuming, season-dependent and might lead to incorrect assessments of commercialised species diversity.", "In this study, we identified cases of vernacular heterogeneity of medicinal plants using a tiered approach of literature research, morphology and DNA barcoding.", "A total of 870 single ingredient medicinal plant samples corresponding to 452 local names were purchased from herbal markets in Dar-es-Salaam and Tanga, Tanzania, and identified using conventional methods as well as DNA barcoding using rbcL, matK and nrITS.", "Using conventional methods, we could identify 70% of samples to at least family level, while 62% yielded a DNA barcode for at least one of the three markers. Combining conventional methods and DNA barcoding, 76% of the samples could be identified to species level, revealing a diversity of at least 175 species in 65 plant families. Analysis of the market samples revealed 80 cases of multilingualism and over- and under-differentiation. Afzelia quanzensis Welw., Zanthoxylum spp., Allophylus spp. and Albizia anthelmintica Brongn. were the most evident cases of multilingualism and over-differentiation, as they were traded under 8-12 vernacular names in up to five local languages. The most obvious case of under-differentiation was mwingajini (Swahili), which matched to eight scientific species in five different plant families.", "Use of a tiered approach increases the identification success of medicinal plants sold in local market and corroborates findings that DNA barcoding can elucidate the identity of material that is unidentifiable based on morphology and literature as well as verify or disqualify these identifications. Results of this study can be used as a basis for quantitative market surveys of fragmented herbal medicine and to investigate conservation issues associated with this trade."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Authors.
