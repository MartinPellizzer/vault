Three amphiphilic copolymers, namely, PBMA-b-(PDMAEMA-r-PPEGMA) (BbDrE), (PBMA-r-PDMAEMA)-b-PPEGMA (BrDbE), and PBMA-r-PDMAEMA-r-PPEGMA (BrDrE), are successfully self-assembled into spherical or oval shaped nanoparticles in aqueous solution and remain stable in PBS, LB, and 10% FBS solutions for at least 3\u00a0days. The critical micelle concentrations are 0.012, 0.025, and 0.041\u00a0mg/mL for BbDrE, BrDbE, and BrDrE, respectively. The zeta potential values under pH 5.5 and pH 7.4 conditions are 3.18/0.19, 8.57/0.046, and 2.54/-0.69\u00a0mV for BbDrE, BrDbE, and BrDrE nanoparticles, respectively. The three copolymers with similar monomer compositions show similar molecular weight and thermostability. Baicalein (BA) and ciprofloxacin (CPX) are encapsulated into the three nanoparticles to obtain BbDrE@BA/CPX, BrDbE@BA/CPX, and BrDrE@BA/CPX nanocomposites, with LC values of 63.9/78.3, 63.9/74.7, and 55.3/64.8, respectively. The two drugs are released from the three drug-loaded nanocomposites with 60%-95% release in pH 5.5 over 24\u00a0h and 15%-30% release in pH 7.4. The drug-loaded nanocomposites show synergistic antibacterial activity than the naked drug (2-8 fold reduction for CPX) or single drug-loaded nanocomposites (4-8 fold reduction for CPX) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The drug-loaded nanocomposites inhibit the formation of bacterial biofilms above their MIC values and eliminate bacterial biofilms observed by fluorescent microscope. Finally, the nanocomposites improve the healing of infection induced by P. aeruginosa and S. aureus on rat dermal wounds. These results indicate that antimicrobial agents with different structures could be an alternative treatment strategy for bacteria-induced infection."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
