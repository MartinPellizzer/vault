They were also tested for lipoxygenase inhibitory activities using the lipoxygenase inhibitor-screening assay. Thyme oil exhibited the greatest antioxidant effect in all assays (80-100%) except in the DPPH assay (60%). Clove leaf oil showed activities comparable to those of thyme oil (53-100%). Cinnamon leaf oil showed strong activities in the aldehyde/carboxylic acid assay (100%) and DPPH assay (84%), but only moderate activities in the conjugated diene assay (24%) and MA/GC assay (48%). Basil oil exhibited a strong effect in the DPPH assay (86%) and moderate activities in the MA/GC assay (35%). Bergamot oil exhibited 100% antioxidant activity in the aldehyde/carboxylic acid assay. Eucalyptus and chamomile oils showed appreciable activities only in the conjugated diene assay. Bitter orange oil exhibited moderate antioxidant activity (53%) only in the MA/GC assay. Aloe vera oil exhibited the greatest lipoxygenase inhibitory activity (96%), followed by thyme oil (86%) and bergamot oil (85%) at a concentration of 0.5 microg/mL. Chamomile oil showed slight lipoxygenase inhibitory activity at 0.5 microg/mL but strong lipoxygenase inducing activity at 5 microg/mL (-123%). Thyme and clove leaf oils contained high levels of thymol (23%) and eugenol (77%), respectively, as a principal of the antioxidant activity. The results obtained in the present study suggest that some essential oils possess strong medicinal activities, which can be utilized for treatment of certain diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Toxicology, University of California, Davis, California 95616, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Alfreda", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shibamoto", "ForeName": "Takayuki", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20499917", "10.1021/jf101077s"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
