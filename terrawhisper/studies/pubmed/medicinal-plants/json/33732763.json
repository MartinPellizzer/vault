They are involved in protecting plants against pathogens or herbivores or involved in attracting pollinators. Isoprenoids are derived from geranyl diphosphate (GPP; C<sub>10</sub>), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP; C<sub>15</sub>), geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP; C<sub>20</sub>), and geranylfarnesyl diphosphate (GFPP; C<sub>25</sub>) that are in turn formed by sequential condensations of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP; C<sub>5</sub>) with an allylic acceptor such as dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP; C<sub>5</sub>), GPP, FPP, or GGPP in a reaction catalyzed by isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (IDSs). IDS enzyme assay for determination of prenyl diphosphate products is generally performed using radiolabelled substrates, and the products formed are identified by employing expensive instruments such as phosphor imager, radio-GC, or radio-HPLC. Though a non-radioactive assay for measuring IDS activity in crude plant extract has been reported, it requires a complex methodology utilizing chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). Here, we describe a non-radioactive and simple inexpensive assay for determining the IDS assay products using non-radiolabeled IPP and its co-allylic substrates DMAPP, GPP, and FPP. The detection of prenyl diphosphate products generated in the assay was highly efficient and spots corresponding to prenyl alcohols were visible at >40 \u00b5M concentrations of IPP and DMAPP/GPP/FPP substrates. The protocol described here is sensitive, reliable, and technically simple, which could be used for functional characterization of IDS candidates."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors; exclusive licensee Bio-protocol LLC."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Plant Biology and Biotechnology Lab, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre, Bengaluru - 560065, India."}], "LastName": "Rai", "ForeName": "Avanish", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Plant Biology and Biotechnology Lab, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre, Bengaluru - 560065, India."}], "LastName": "Nagegowda", "ForeName": "Dinesh A", "Initials": "DA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Bio Protoc", "NlmUniqueID": "101635102", "ISSNLinking": "2331-8325"}, "CoiStatement": "Competing interestsThe authors declare no competing interests."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Bradford M.
