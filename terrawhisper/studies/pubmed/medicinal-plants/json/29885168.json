The subjects were randomised into two equal groups. The treatment group received myrtus communis L. solution and a placebo shampoo, while the control group received ketoconazole shampoo and a placebo solution. The total duration of the study for each subject was one month and subjects in both groups used their respective interventions 8 times during that period. The parameters studied were pruritus, erythema, severity of scaling, and the extent of scalp involvement. All subjects underwent scalp scaling tests at the beginning, after 10 days and at the end of the 30th day.
