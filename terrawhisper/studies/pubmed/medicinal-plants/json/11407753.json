Chilli powders were collected from different supermarkets in Hyderabad, AP. They were analysed for aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) content by an indirect competitive ELISA. To avoid the influence of interfering substances present in chilli extracts, it was necessary to prepare the aflatoxin standards in methanol extracts of chillies free from aflatoxins. For nine representative samples there was good agreement between ELISA and HPLC estimations of AFB1 and the results suggested that the ELISA procedure adopted was dependable. Of the 182 chilli samples tested, 59% of the samples were contaminated with AFB1 and 18% contained the toxin at non-permissible levels. The highest AFB1 concentration of 969 microg/kg was found in one sample representing grade 3. Overall the maximum percentage of chilli pods showing AFB1 levels higher than 30 microg/kg (non-permissible levels) was in grade 3. Chilli pods stored in refrigerated rooms showed the lowest proportion of samples containing aflatoxin. Nearly 9% of the chilli powders sold in supermarkets contained non-permissible aflatoxin levels. This report highlights the importance of using grade 1 chilli pods to minimize aflatoxin contamination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Crops Research Institute for the Semi Arid Tropics, Andhra Pradesh, India. d.reddy@cgiar.org"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reddy", "ForeName": "S V", "Initials": "SV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mayi", "ForeName": "D K", "Initials": "DK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reddy", "ForeName": "M U", "Initials": "MU"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thirumala-Devi", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reddy", "ForeName": "D V", "Initials": "DV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Addit Contam", "NlmUniqueID": "8500474", "ISSNLinking": "0265-203X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9N2N2Y55MH", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxin B1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxin B1"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11407753", "10.1080/02652030119491"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
