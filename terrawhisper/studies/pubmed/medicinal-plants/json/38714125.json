Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for humans, and its role in plants depends on applied dosage. ABC transporters are considered to participate in Se translocation in plants, but detailed studies in soybean are still lacking. We identified 196 ABC genes in soybean transcriptome under Se exposure using next-generation sequencing and single-molecule real-time sequencing technology. These proteins fell into eight subfamilies: 8 GmABCA, 51 GmABCB, 39 GmABCC, 5 GmABCD, 1 GmABCE, 10 GmABCF, 74 GmABCG, and 8 GmABCI, with amino acid length 121-3022 aa, molecular weight 13.50-341.04\u00a0kDa, and isoelectric point 4.06-9.82. We predicted a total of 15 motifs, some of which were specific to certain subfamilies (especially GmABCB, GmABCC, and GmABCG). We also found predicted alternative splicing in GmABCs: 60 events in selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs)-treated, 37 in sodium selenite (Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>)-treated samples. The GmABC genes showed differential expression in leaves and roots under different application of Se species and Se levels, most of which are belonged to GmABCB, GmABCC, and GmABCG subfamilies with functions in auxin transport, barrier formation, and detoxification. Protein-protein interaction and weighted gene co-expression network analysis suggested functional gene networks with hub ABC genes, contributing to our understanding of their biological functions. Our results illuminate the contributions of GmABC genes to Se accumulation and tolerance in soybean and provide insight for a better understanding of their roles in soybean as well as in other plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS.
