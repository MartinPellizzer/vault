The two plant-based therapies that had the most studies exploring their therapeutic potential on side effects were Zingiber officinale and Aloe vera.", "This study showed that some plants listed in RENISUS have shown preventive and curative potential on side effects induced by conventional treatments in patients with different types of cancer.
