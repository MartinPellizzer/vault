The present study was undertaken to assess the incorporation of the extract of licorice supplementation on the growth performance, carcass yield, blood indices, and antioxidative capacity in broilers. Three hundred twenty unsexed one-day-old Ross 308 broiler chicks were allocated randomly into four groups. Chicks in each group were randomly subdivided into eight replicates of ten chicks. The first group received a basal diet and was considered a control. The respective groups received a basal diet supplemented with 1, 2, and 3\u202fg licorice extract/kg diet. The obtained results indicated that supplementation of licorice extract to broiler chicks resulted in heavier BW and weight gain and a better feed conversion ratio during the experimental periods compared with the control group. However, feed consumption increased during the entire growing period. Supplementing the broiler's diet with licorice extract led to a higher value of erythrocytes, leukocytes, haemoglobin, plasma total protein, albumin, and antioxidant concentration and a low value in plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, urea, and total cholesterol. It could be concluded that the dietary addition of licorice extracts 2 and 3\u202fg licorice extract/kg diet improved broiler chicks' growth performance and physiological status."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
