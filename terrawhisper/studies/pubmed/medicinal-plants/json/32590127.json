The present study was designed to elucidate the potential of swertiamarin (SW), a secoiridoidal glycoside isolated from Enicostemma littorale in curtailing the cholinergic dysfunction. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, SW was found to enhance neurotransmission by modulating AChE and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) activity; being orchestrated through up-regulation of unc-17 and unc-50. SW exhibited AChE inhibition both in vivo and cell-free system. The in silico molecular docking of SW and human AChE (hAChE) displayed good binding energy of -6.02. Interestingly, the increase in aldicarb and levamisole sensitivity post SW treatment was curtailed to a significant level in daf-16 and skn-1 mutants. SW raised the level of the endogenous antioxidant enzymes through up-regulation of sod-3 and gst-4 that act downstream to DAF-16 and SKN-1, imparting protection against neurodegeneration. The outcome of our study displays SW as a potential natural molecule for the amelioration of cholinergic dysfunction. Moreover, the study also indicates that SW elicits antioxidant response via up-modulation of daf-16 possibly through unc-17 upregulation. Further research on SW pertaining to the underlying mechanism and potential is expected to significantly advance the current understanding and design of possible ameliorative or near ameliorative regimens for cholinergic dysfunction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
