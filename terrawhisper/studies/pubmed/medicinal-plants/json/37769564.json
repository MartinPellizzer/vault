Here, for the first time, the thickness-controllable Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@MIL-100(Fe) heterogeneous materials with special hollow nanoflower (HFs) morphology had been synthesized. The morphology and shell thickness of the nano-petal could be tuned by changing the reaction time. The resultant Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@MIL-100(Fe) HFs exhibited the hollow nanoflower shapes and exposed abundant accessible active sites. The enrichment performance of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@MIL-100(Fe) HFs was approximately 1.4-1.7 times that of spherical Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@MIL-100(Fe) composite for benzoylurea insecticides (BUs). Furthermore, the optimal sample achieved the wide linearity (0.05-500\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>) and low limits of detection, (0.003-0.01\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>) for BUs. The research provides a new strategy for highly sensitive detection and monitoring of harmful pollutant levels in the environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
