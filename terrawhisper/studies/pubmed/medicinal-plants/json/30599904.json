Vernonia cinerea, a perennial tropical herb, is wildly used as a traditional folk medicine for treatment of intestinal diseases and various skin diseases in addition to possessing anti-cancer activity. However, the effect of 8\u03b1-tigloyloxyhirsutinolide-13-O-acetate (8\u03b1TGH) as a major sesquiterpene lactone compound found in V. cinerea and the underlying mechanism of its action on oral cancer cells remains unknown.", "To investigate the anti-cancer activity of 8\u03b1TGH extracted from V. cinerea and the underlying mechanism of its action in oral cancer cells.", "The anti-proliferative effect of 8\u03b1TGH on oral squamous cell carcinoma (HSC4) and lung carcinoma (A549) was determined using the SRB colorimetric method. The molecular mechanism of 8\u03b1TGH was explored using kinase inhibitors, followed by Western blotting or RT-qPCR. Flow cytometry and Western blotting were used to assess cell cycle arrest.", "8\u03b1TGH inhibited cancer cell growth more effectively on HSC4 than A549 and was much less effective on tested normal oral cells. 8\u03b1TGH inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation on both cancer cells. Notably, 8\u03b1TGH was able to suppress the constantly activated STAT2 found only in HSC4. The STAT2 inhibition by 8\u03b1TGH consequently caused down-regulation of ISG15 and ISG15 conjugates. As a result, decreased expression of CDK1/2 and Cyclin B1 was detected leading to G2/M cell cycle arrest.", "8\u03b1TGH isolated from V. cinerea preferentially inhibits the proliferation of oral cancer cells by causing G2/M cell cycle arrest via inhibition of both STAT3 and STAT2 phosphorylation. The results provide molecular bases for developing 8\u03b1TGH as a drug candidate or a complementary treatment of oral cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier GmbH.
