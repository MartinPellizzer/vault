However, our current understanding of the human diet is still limited in terms of fully capturing the role of dietary compounds in the intraspecies and interspecies biochemical networks that determine our health. This is due, in part, to a lack of detailed information on the presence of small molecules in food (molecular weight \u22641000 daltons), their amounts, and their interactions with known protein targets. As a result, our ability to develop a mechanistic understanding of how food chemicals impact our health is limited. In recent years, the Foodome project has tackled several aspects of this challenging universe, leveraging the expertise of a diverse group of scientific communities, from computer science to epidemiology. Here, we review the most recent efforts of the Foodome project in mapping the chemical complexity of food and predicting its effect on human health. Leveraging the network medicine framework applied to Amla-a medicinal plant-we offer a rationale for future research on the mechanism of action of food bioactive small molecules, whose designing principles could inspire next-generation drug discovery and combinations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Network Science Institute, Department of Physics, Northeastern University, Boston, MA (F.N., G.M.)."}], "LastName": "Nasirian", "ForeName": "Farzaneh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5201-6774"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Network Science Institute, Department of Physics, Northeastern University, Boston, MA (F.N., G.M.)."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA (G.M.)."}], "LastName": "Menichetti", "ForeName": "Giulia", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9505803", "ISSNLinking": "1079-5642"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Disclosures</b> None."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "26"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37128923", "10.1161/ATVBAHA.122.318332"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
