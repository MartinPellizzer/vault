Such metals are highly toxic to living organisms even in low concentrations owing to their cumulative effect. The present paper describes the the development of a pre-concentration flow injection analysis-flame atomic absorption spectrometric system to determine the lead content in medicinal plants at the ppb level.", "To develop a pre-concentration flow injection analysis-flame atomic absorption spectrometric system to determine the lead content in medicinal plants at the ppb level.", "A pre-concentration flow system was coupled to a flame atomic absorption spectrometer. The plant samples were analysed after nitroperchloric digestion. The proposed system was optimised by evaluating the following parameters: nature, concentration and volume of the eluent solution, elution flow rate, elution efficiency, pre-concentration flow rate and pre-concentration time.", "The proposed system exhibited good performance with high precision and repeatability (RSD < or = 2.36%), excellent linearity (r = 0.9999), low sample consumption (10.5 mL per determination) and an analytical throughput of 55 samples/h. Lead concentrations ranged from 3.37 + or - 0.25 to 7.03 + or - 0.51 microg/g in dry material. This concentration interval is greater than that previously published in the literature.", "The inclusion of a pre-concentration column in the flow manifold improved the sensitivity of the spectrometer. Thus, it was possible to determine the analyte at the ng/mL level in sample solutions of medicinal plants. This is a very important accomplishment, especially when the cumulative effect of heavy metals in living organisms is considered."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biopharmacotoxicology, University of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto (UNAERP), Av.
