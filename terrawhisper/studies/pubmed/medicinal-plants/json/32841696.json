Petroselinum sativum Hoffm. belongs to Apiaceae family. It is traditionally used to treat arterial hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease, renal disease, and recently reported as a plant endowed with a female anti-infertility effect.", "This study aims to evaluate the in vivo effect of hydro-ethanolic extract and polyphenols of Petroselinum sativum Hoffm. on cholesterol, protein and estrogen levels, and characterize the chemical composition of polyphenolic fraction. In addition, acute toxicity and anti-inflammatory activity of tested extract was also investigated.", "Chemical composition of polyphenolic fraction was determined using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode-Array Detection (HPLC-DAD). First, toxicological investigations including sub-acute toxicity were performed by measuring animals' weights daily for four weeks. Afterwards, histopathological examination of livers and kidneys, and serum assay of ASAT and ALAT were also checked. Next, the acute in vivo anti-inflammatory study of the hydro-ethanolic extract and polyphenols of Petroselinum sativum Hoffm. versus Indomethacin was conducted. Furthermore, we evaluated the estrogenic effect of its hydro-ethanolic extract and the polyphenolic fraction following biochemical assays for the determination of proteins, cholesterol and estrogen levels.", "The results revealed the presence of some phenolic compounds mainly ferulic acid, gallic acid and quercetin. Petroselinum sativum Hoffm. extracts also showed no evidence of hepatotoxicity nor nephrotoxicity, with remarkable anti-inflammatory activity, as well as a significant estrogenic effect compared to negative control.", "This study provides a scope of the potential use of Petroselinum sativum Hoffm. extracts in counteracting female infertility issues."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
