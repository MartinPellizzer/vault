AIM OF THE STUDY: This work aimed to study the anticancerous effect of Rotheca serrata (root and leaf) on cancer cell lines MCF-7 (breast cancer cell line) and Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y.", "This investigation was a preliminary one which supported the retrospective and safe use of plants as described in Ayurveda. Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with High Glucose (DMEM-HG) for culturing MCF-7- Human Breast cancer cell line and Minimum essential Medium (MEM)+F12 medium for culturing SH-SY5Y- Homo sapiens bone marrow neuroblast were used. MTT assay measured the cell proliferation rate and conversely, when metabolic events lead to apoptosis or necrosis, the reduction in cell viability.", "The results indicated that the Methanolic extract of Rotheca serrata (root and leaf) showed high anticancer activity. Different concentrations of plant extracts (25, 50, 100, 200, 400 \u00b5g/ml) were used to study the anticancerous activity, amongst which the significant results were obtained for 400 \u00b5g/ml concentration (both root & leaf). Effective anticancer activity against MCF - 7 breast cancer cells was shown in methanoilc extracts and were expressed as IC 50 values; in root (IC 50 value = 61.8259 \u00b1 7.428 \u00b5g/ml) and in leaf (IC 50 value = 78.1497 \u00b1 6.316 \u00b5g/ml). The MTT assay in case of neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell lines revealed that 400 \u00b5g/ml concentration of leaf methanolic extract showed effective inhibition of cancer cells with IC 50 value 37.8462 \u00b1 2.957 \u00b5g/ml as compared to IC 50 value of root methanolic extract which was 57.0895 \u00b1 2.351 \u00b5g/ml.", "R. serrata possess anticancer activity against breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY 5Y) cell lines.
