All the explant types were regenerative and maximum number (3.6) and frequency (94%) of axillary shoot formation of (5.08 cm long) was recorded in the nodes cultured in BAP (1 mg L(-1)) after 6 weeks. Combinations of BAP (1 mg L(-1)) and indole-3-acetic acid/l-naphthalene acetic acid (0.01-1 mg L(-1); IAA/NAA) tested with nodes induced formation of less number (3 and 2.2) of shoots at same frequency (94%). All the explant types viz. node, shoot tip, internode and leaf base of in vitro derived shoots responded earlier and better in lower concentrations of BAP (0.5-2 mg L(-1)) with formation of 8, 3.1, 6.4 and 1.8 shoots respectively during the same period. In spite of the advanced and increased caulogenic responses, differences in cytokinin requirements between different explants observed during culture initiation still persisted with the nodes, shoot tips, internodes and petiole segments responding best at 0.5, 1 and 2 mg L(-1) BAP, respectively. The repeated reculture up to 10 cycles of the nodes from the shoot cultures each at 6-week intervals enabled multiplication and stocking of shoots without decline. Rooting of 3-7 cm shoot cuttings was induced in half-strength MS liquid medium containing IAA (1 mg L(-1)) with formation of 7.25 roots of 2.41 cm length within 6 weeks. Rooted plants were established at 84-96% rate in community pots without hardening, the least value (84%) being obtained with NAA- induced thick and calloid rooted plants. Four month old community potted plants were reintroduced into native forest habitats at 95% efficiency and 8 months after restoration, the plants were uniform in morphological, growth, cytological and peroxidase and esterase isozyme characteristics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Biotechnology Division, Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute, Pacha-Palode, Thiruvananthapuram, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "L G", "Initials": "LG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seeni", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthaleneacetic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Purines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33T7G7757C", "NameOfSubstance": "1-naphthaleneacetic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6U1S09C61L", "NameOfSubstance": "indoleacetic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JAC85A2161", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KXG6A989PS", "NameOfSubstance": "benzylaminopurine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P39Y9652YJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Kinetin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Celastraceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthaleneacetic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Purines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12019765"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
