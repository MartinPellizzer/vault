It has been reported that signaling pathways play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PD, while the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have been found to possess a protective effect against PD. TCM has demonstrated significant potential in mitigating oxidative stress (OS), neuroinflammation, and apoptosis of DA neurons via the regulation of signaling pathways associated with PD.", "This study discussed and analyzed the signaling pathways involved in the occurrence and development of PD and the mechanism of active ingredients of TCM regulating PD via signaling pathways, with the aim of providing a basis for the development and clinical application of therapeutic strategies for TCM in PD.", "With \"Parkinson's disease\", \"Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease\", \"Lewy Body Parkinson's Disease\", \"Parkinson's Disease, Idiopathic\", \"Parkinson Disease, Idiopathic\", \"Parkinson's disorders\", \"Parkinsonism syndrome\", \"Traditional Chinese medicine\", \"Chinese herbal medicine\", \"active ingredients\", \"medicinal plants\" as the main keywords, PubMed, Web of Science and other online search engines were used for literature retrieval.", "PD exhibits a close association with various signaling pathways, including but not limited to MAPKs, NF-\u03baB, PI3K/Akt, Nrf2/ARE, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, TLR/TRIF, NLRP3, Notch. The therapeutic potential of TCM lies in its ability to regulate these signaling pathways. In addition, the active ingredients of TCM have shown significant effects in improving OS, neuroinflammation, and DA neuron apoptosis in PD.", "The active ingredients of TCM have unique advantages in regulating PD-related signaling pathways. It is suggested to combine network pharmacology and bioinformatics to study the specific targets of TCM. This not only provides a new way for the prevention and treatment of PD with the active ingredients of TCM, but also provides a scientific basis for the selection and development of TCM preparations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
