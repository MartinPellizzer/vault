Beta-galactosidases II and III were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by a procedure involving acid precipitation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose (DEAE-Cellulose) and con A-Sepharose. and chromatofocusing. Beta-galactosidases I, II and III have the same molecular mass of 87 kDa. comprising two nonidentical subunits with molecular masses of 38 and 48 kDa, while beta-galactosidases IV and V have molecular masses of 45 and 73 kDa, respectively. All the enzymes were active against p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactoside, and to a lesser extent, p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinoside and p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-fucoside. The enzymes were inhibited by D-galactono-1,4-lactone, D-galactose, Hg2+, Ag+ and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Beta-galactosidases I, II and III were shown to be competitively inhibited by either D-galactono-1, 4-lactone or D-galactose. Isoforms I, II and III have a common optimal pH of 3.6, while isoforms IV and V have pH optima at 3.8 and 4.0, respectively. Isoelectric points of isoforms I, II and III were 7.7, 7.5 and 7.3, respectively. Double immunodiffusion analysis indicated that beta-galactosidases I, II, III and V are immunologically similar to each other, while beta-galactosidase IV shares partially identical antigenic determinants with the other four isoforms. The purified beta-galactosidases II and III were capable of releasing D-galactose residue from the hemicellulose fraction isolated from mung bean seeds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "K C", "Initials": "KC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "C S", "Initials": "CS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Subunits"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.23", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-Galactosidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J2B2A4N98G", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Affinity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Monosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Subunits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "beta-Galactosidase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11393513", "10.1016/s0031-9422(01)00022-x", "S0031-9422(01)00022-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
