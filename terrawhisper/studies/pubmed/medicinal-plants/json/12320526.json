The research of Professor Sali, who produced and marketed Mariandina as a cure for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is not recognized, according to Dr. Jeremiah Twa-twa, Registrar of the National Medical Council. Professor Sali had been given six months to produce an acceptable protocol, with controls, that demonstrated the efficacy of the drug. He had stated previously that his patients received a minimum of six tablets daily of Mariandina A, B, or J; thousands are said to have been treated. Professor Sali, who returned to Uganda in 1990 with a 100,000-pound loan to produce the drug, advised his patients to sell everything they owned in order to pay for their treatment, according to Major Ruranga Rubaramira (head of a joint clinical council). The Uganda AIDS Commission is also considering the use of herbs in the treatment of AIDS; nine Western-trained researchers are collaborating with herbalists in studies that have shown promising results. Dr. Donna Kabatesi, who heads a clinic that uses both herbs and Western medicine in the treatment of AIDS patients at Mulago hospital, believes herbs are equally effective for some purposes."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["118582", "00260443"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: AIDS ANALYSIS AFRICA"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome", "Africa", "Africa South Of The Sahara", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Diseases", "Drugs", "Eastern Africa", "English Speaking Africa", "Ethics", "Health", "Health Services", "Hiv Infections", "Knowledge", "Medicine", "Plants, Medicinal", "Product Approval", "Treatment--standards", "Uganda", "Viral Diseases"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12320526", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1997", "Month": "03", "Day": "04"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2005", "Month": "05", "Day": "11"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1016-8974", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "6", "Issue": "6", "PubDate": {"Year": "1996", "Month": "Dec"}}, "Title": "AIDS analysis Africa", "ISOAbbreviation": "AIDS Anal Afr"}, "ArticleTitle": "Post-Kemron, Uganda demands proof of the \"Mariandina\" drug.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "1", "MedlinePgn": "1"}, "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "South Africa", "MedlineTA": "AIDS Anal Afr", "NlmUniqueID": "101085246", "ISSNLinking": "1016-8974"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa South of the Sahara"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa, Eastern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Consumer Product Safety"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HIV Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Knowledge"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Therapeutics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Uganda"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virus Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12320526"]}}]}
