Previously, we demonstrated that down-regulation of AQP3 in fetal membranes may contribute to the development of oligohydramnios. In this study, we investigated the effects of Danshen extract on AQP3 expression in human amniotic epithelial cells from term pregnancies with oligohydramnios or those with those with (those with) normovolemic amniotic fluid. Human amniotic epithelial cells from the oligohydramnios group expressed a lower level of AQP3 mRNA and protein than those with normovolemia. Tweleve hour (Twelvehours) of treatment with Danshen extract, in a dose dependent manner, significantly increased the expression of AQP3 in the two groups. However, human amniotic epithelial cells from the oligohydramnios patients showed a greater sensitivity to the treatment of Danshen extract. These data provide a molecular basis for the treatment of patients with oligohydraminos."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wenwen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yiwen", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Xiaoli", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Huihui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China."}], "LastName": "Hua", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China, zjwzzxq@yeah.net."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Xueqiong", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Front Biosci (Landmark Ed)", "NlmUniqueID": "101612996", "ISSNLinking": "2768-6698"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "AQP3 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "158801-98-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aquaporin 3"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amnion"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aquaporin 3"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oligohydramnios"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28199196", "10.2741/4537", "4537"]}}]}
