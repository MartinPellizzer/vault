Studies have shown that metabolites isolated from licorice have many pharmacological activities, such as antiinflammatory, anti-viral, participation in immune regulation, anti-tumor and other activities. This article gives an overview of the pharmacological activities and mechanisms of licorice metabolites and the adverse reactions that need attention. This review helps to further investigate the possibility of licorice as a potential drug for various diseases. It is hoped that this review can provide a relevant theoretical basis for relevant scholars' research and their own learning."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Joint Research Center of Guangzhou University and Keele Univeristy for Gene Interference and\nApplication, School of Life Science, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou 510006, People\u2019s Republic of China"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University,\nNanjing 210023, People\u2019s Republic of China"}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Joint Research Center of Guangzhou University and Keele Univeristy for Gene Interference and\nApplication, School of Life Science, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou 510006, People\u2019s Republic of China"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University,\nNanjing 210023, People\u2019s Republic of China"}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Joint Research Center of Guangzhou University and Keele Univeristy for Gene Interference and\nApplication, School of Life Science, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou 510006, People\u2019s Republic of China"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University,\nNanjing 210023, People\u2019s Republic of China"}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Fa-Qian", "Initials": "FQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University,\nNanjing 210023, People\u2019s Republic of China"}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Hai-Liang", "Initials": "HL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6FO62043WK", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31612817", "10.2174/0929867325666191011115407", "CMC-EPUB-101365"]}}]}
