Modern pharmacological investigations have demonstrated its multiple activities, such as antitussive, expectorant, antiemetic, antitumor, antibacterial, and sedative-hypnotic activities.", "This review aims to summarize the information about the biological traits, genetic diversity, active components, and continuous cropping obstacle of P. ternata in order to improve its use.", "In this review, the relevant literature was gathered by using Pinellia ternata, genetic diversity, active components, and continuous cropping obstacle as the keywords from Google Scholar, PubMed, Springer Link, the Wiley online library, SciFinder, SCOPUS, Baidu Scholar, China national knowledge infrastructure (CNKI), and WANFANF DATA (up to April 2020).", "P. ternata is the most widely used herb in the Pinellia genus to treat several diseases. The genetic diversity of P. ternata has been extensively studied, and its high genetic diversity level in China has been demonstrated. Modern pharmacological research has indicated that amino acids, alkaloids, and polysaccharides are the main active components supporting P. ternata's medicinal effects. However, an efficient method for determining its active components is still unavailable. The method used to evaluate Pinelliae Rhizoma (PR) quality standards should be further optimized. The continuous cropping obstacle has a significant effect on the quantity and quality of P. ternata. The underlying mechanism of the continuous cropping obstacle needs to be further explored.", "P. ternata has emerged as a valuable source of traditional medicine. Some uses of P. ternata in medicine have been validated by pharmacological investigations. However, a more efficient analytical method should be established to evaluate the quality of PR based on multiple quality markers. Furthermore, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and DNA barcoding should be introduced to identify the authenticity of PR. In addition, the genes involved in the metabolic synthesis pathways of the main active components, population genetic relationships, the quality control of processed PR, and the continuous cropping obstacle need to be further elucidated. We hope this review will allow for better utilization of this valuable herb."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
