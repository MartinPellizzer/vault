Oral administration is the most common route of administration for the treatment of diabetes and its vascular complications. Essential oil extracts from Chinese medicine possess potential therapeutic effects on vascular endothelial injury. However, low solubility and volatility of essential oils generally result in poor oral absorption. Development of nanocarriers for essential oils is a promising strategy to overcome the physiological barriers of oral absorption. In this study, a nanoemulsion composed of bovine serum albumin (BSA)-dextran sulfate (DS) conjugate and sodium deoxycholate (SD) was constructed. The nanoemulsions were verified with promoted oral absorption and prolonged circulation time. After the primary evaluation of the nanoemulsion, essential oil from Alpinia zerumbet Fructus (EOFAZ)-loaded nanoemulsion (denoted as EOFAZ@BD<sub>5</sub>/S) was prepared and characterized. Compared to the free EOFAZ, EOFAZ@BD<sub>5</sub>/S increased the protective effects on HG-induced HUVEC injury in vitro and ameliorative effects on the vascular endothelium disorder and tunica media fibroelastosis in a T<sub>2</sub>DM mouse model. Collectively, this study provides a nanoemulsion for the oral delivery of essential oils, which holds strong promise in the treatment of diabetes-induced vascular endothelial injury."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
