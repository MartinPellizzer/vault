Recently, a large diversity of animal models has been developed to better understand the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and new drugs have been introduced in the market to treat this disease. The aim of this work was to review the available animal models of diabetes and some in vitro models which have been used as tools to investigate the mechanism of action of drugs with potential antidiabetic properties. In addition, a MEDLINE/PUBMED search for articles on natural products, pancreatectomy and diabetes mellitus treatment published between 1996 and 2006 was done. In the majority of the studies, natural products mainly derived from plants have been tested in diabetes models induced by chemical agents. This review contributes to the researcher in the ethnopharmacology field to designs new strategies for the development of novel drugs to treat this serious condition that constitutes a global public health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Analysis, Center of Health Sciences, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Campus Universit\u00e1rio, Trindade, Florian\u00f3polis, SC, Brazil. saleh@ccs.ufsc.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fr\u00f6de", "ForeName": "T S", "Initials": "TS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Medeiros", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "genetics", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "116"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18068921", "10.1016/j.jep.2007.10.038", "S0378-8741(07)00586-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
