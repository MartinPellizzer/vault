This paper stressed on study the effects of YQHX therapy on blood coagulation process in vivo. The effects of several TCM preparations on CHD patients were observed by thromboelastography (TEG), prothrombin time, etc. After giving various preparations 20ml intravenously, the results of TEG showed that the values of r, k, c, 1 were decreased and ma increased by QiXue injection, the differences of k and ma were significant; while no significant change by Shen Qi injection and the k value was significantly reduced by DanShen injection. The results of prothrombin time with QiXue injection showed distinct dose-dependent effects, it shortened with 20ml and significantly lengthened with 40ml. This results suggested that there was complicated effects of different YQHX preparations as well as of different dosages."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing College of TCM."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "X Y", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "J Z", "Initials": "JZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "9211576", "ISSNLinking": "1003-5370"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Coagulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Coronary Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prothrombin Time"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thrombelastography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thrombin Time"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1301848"]}}]}
