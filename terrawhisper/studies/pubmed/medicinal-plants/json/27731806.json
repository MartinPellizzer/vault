Responding to their numerous health benefits, a comparative study on the quantitative determination of total polyphenolic compounds and flavonoids was carried out in Achillea millefolium and Equisetum arvense. Total polyphenolic compounds were quantified by Folin-Ciocalteau method using different solvents in order to prove their extraction efficiency. Focus within total polyphenolic quantification study was placed on the traditional reflux and solvents used were: water, 100% acetone, 100% ethanol, 80% ethanol, 50% methanol and 70% methanol. In order to make flavonoids free from glycosidic moiety for quantification, hydrolysis was performed in 50% MeOH at 90\u00b0C using 6 M HCl concentration. Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in gradient elution mode at 50\u00b0C using Hypersil BDS (RP-18) column was employed for the separation of flavonoids. Mobile phase used consisted of different combinations of water-methanol-tetrahydrofuran-phosphoric acid. Flavonoids quantified were luteolin, quercetin, apigenin, isorhamnetin and kaempferol."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, Mardan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Qureshi", "ForeName": "Muhammad Nasimullah", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Analytical Chemistry and Radiochemistry, Leopold-Franzens University Innsbruck, Innrain Innsbruck, Austria / Bionorica Research GmbH, Mitterweg, Innsbruck, Austria."}], "LastName": "Stecher", "ForeName": "Guenther", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Analytical Chemistry and Radiochemistry, Leopold-Franzens University Innsbruck, Innrain Innsbruck, Austria."}], "LastName": "Bonn", "ForeName": "Guenther Karl", "Initials": "GK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Achillea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Reverse-Phase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Equisetum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27731806"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
