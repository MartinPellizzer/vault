However, the biological characteristics and molecular mechanisms of TCM in the treatment of human diseases remain largely unknown. Genomics plays an important role in modern medicine and biology. Here, we introduce genomics and other related omics to the study of herbs to propose a new discipline, Herbgenomics, that aims to uncover the genetic information and regulatory networks of herbs and to clarify their molecular mechanisms in the prevention and treatment of human diseases. Herbgenomics includes herbal structural genomics, functional genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabonomics, epigenomics and metagenomics. Genomic information, together with transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data, can therefore be used to predict secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways and their regulation, triggering a revolution in discovery-based research aimed at understanding the genetics and biology of herbs. Herbgenomics provides an effective platform to support chemical and biological analyses of complex herbal products that may contain more than one active component. Herbgenomics is now being applied to many areas of herb related biological research to help understand the quality of traditional medicines and for molecular herb identification through the establishment of an herbal gene bank. Moreover, functional genomics can contribute to model herb research platforms, geoherbal research, genomics-assisted herb breeding, and herbal synthetic biology, all of which are important for securing the future of medicinal plants and their active compounds. In addition, Herbgenomics will facilitate the elucidation of the targets and mechanism of herbs in disease treatment and provide support for personalized precise medicine.Herbgenomics will accelerate the application of cutting-edge technologies in herbal research and provide an unprecedented opportunity to revolutionize the use and acceptance of traditional herbal medicines."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shi-Lin", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Jing-Yuan", "Initials": "JY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epigenomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metagenomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Proteomics"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28929670", "10.4268/cjcmm20162101"]}}]}
