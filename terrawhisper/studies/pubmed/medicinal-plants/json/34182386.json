Hence, the present study focused on atrazine induced stress amelioration of Andrographis paniculata, an important medicinal plant, by a plant growth promoting and atrazine degrading endophytic bacterium CIMAP-A7 inoculation. Atrazine has a non-significant effect at a lower dose while at a higher dose (lower: 25 and higher: 50\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup>) 22 and 36% decrease in secondary metabolite content and plant dry weight of A. paniculata was recorded, respectively. Endophyte CIMAP-A7 inoculation significantly reduced atrazine soil content, by 78 and 51% at lower and a higher doses respectively, than their respective control treatments. Inoculation of CIMAP-A7 exhibited better plant growth in terms of increased total chlorophyll, carotenoid, protein, and metabolite content with reduced atrazine content under both atrazine contaminated and un-contaminated treatments. Atrazine induced oxidative stress in A. paniculata was also ameliorated by CIMAP-A7 by reducing stress enzymes, proline, and malondialdehyde accumulation under contaminated soil conditions than un-inoculated treatments. Furthermore, the presence of atrazine metabolites deisopropylatrazine (DIA) and desethylatrazine (DEA) strongly suggests a role of CIMAP-A7 in mineralization however, the absence of these metabolites in uninoculated soil and all plant samples were recorded. These findings advocate that the amelioration of atrazine induced stress with no/least pesticide content in plant tissues by plant-endophyte co-interactions would be efficient in the remediation of atrazine contaminated soils and ensure safe crop produce."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
