Although C. sativa is one of the most investigated medicinal plants in the world, it faces some of the greatest controversies surrounding its legalization and use as a medication. C. sativa contains several hundred phytoconstituents, including the infamous \"cannabinoids\". It is necessary to properly understand the medicinal importance of these phytochemicals and spread awareness among the countries where cannabis is still facing legal obstacles. The current review focuses on the most recent literature pertaining to various applications of cannabinoids, with a special focus on the medicinal aspect of these phytochemicals. Peer-reviewed articles focusing on the importance of cannabis and cannabinoids are the target of this review. Articles were selected based on the relevance to the general scope of the work, i.e., application of cannabinoids. Cannabinoids can truly be regarded as wonder drugs, considering their immense diversity of usage. Unfortunately, however, many of the mares have never been researched biologically or pharmacologically due to their low yield in the plant. However, the approval of some cannabinoids by the FDA (along with other recognized national medical health systems) has opened the horizon for the use of these natural drugs in medicines such as Epidiolex\u00ae (cannabidiol, used for the treatment of severe forms of epilepsy) and Sativex\u00ae(\u0394<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, used for the treatment of spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis). Many pharmacological properties of C. sativa are attributed to cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component, along with \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u0394<sup>9</sup>-THC), a psychoactive component. This review addresses the most important applications or current utilization of cannabinoids in a variety of treatments such as chronic pain, cancer, emesis, anorexia, irritable bowel syndrome, communicable diseases, glaucoma, and central nervous system disorders. The biosynthetic pathway of cannabinoids is also discussed. In short, cannabis has a myriad of bioactive compounds that have the potential to increase the list of approved cannabinoids suitable for therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Islamia College, Peshawar, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khalid", "ForeName": "Shah", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah Almukkarramah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Almalki", "ForeName": "Faisal A", "Initials": "FA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah Almukkarramah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Hadda", "ForeName": "Taibi Ben", "Initials": "TB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah Almukkarramah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Bader", "ForeName": "Ammar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences, Collage of Pharmacy, Al Ain University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates."}], "LastName": "Abu-Izneid", "ForeName": "Tareq", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry LCOA, Synthesis of Biomolecules and Molecular Modelling Group, Badji-Mokhtar - Annaba University, Box 12, 23000 Annaba, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Berredjem", "ForeName": "Malika", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Northern Borders University, Arar, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Elsharkawy", "ForeName": "Eman R", "Initials": "ER"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, King Khalid University, Abha, 62529, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alqahtani", "ForeName": "Ali M", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cannabinoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19GBJ60SN5", "NameOfSubstance": "Cannabidiol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7J8897W37S", "NameOfSubstance": "Dronabinol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cannabidiol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cannabinoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cannabis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dronabinol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greece"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Horses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "26"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33267756", "10.2174/1381612826666201202125807", "CPD-EPUB-112001"]}}]}
