(Nymphaeaceae), also known as sacred lotus, is a well known medicinal plant. This article reviews the traditional uses, phytochemistry and therapeutic reports on different parts of N. nucifera viz. the seeds, rhizomes, leaves and flowers. This review also describes various compounds isolated from different parts of this plant and the therapeutic benefits derived from those phytoconstituents.", "There are several therapeutic benefits of this plant for which different parts are used. The extracts of rhizomes, seeds, flowers and leaves have been reported to have varied therapeutic potential. Several bioactive compounds have been derived from these plant parts belonging to different chemical groups, including alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, triterpenoid, vitamins etc., which all have their own therapeutic impact. Thus, the pharmacological effects and various active ingredients of different parts of N. nucifera are well understood.", "In this review we explore the current pharmaceutical, phytochemical and pharmacological knowledge about this well known plant species as well as several emerging aspects for research on N. nucifera."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Natural Product Studies, Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India. pulokm@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mukherjee", "ForeName": "Pulok K", "Initials": "PK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mukherjee", "ForeName": "Debajyoti", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maji", "ForeName": "Amal K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rai", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heinrich", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nelumbo"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Structures"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}], "NumberOfReferences": "98"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19298686", "10.1211/jpp/61.04.0001"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
