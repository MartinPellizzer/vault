Therefore, in the present study, the effect of soil amendment with chitosan (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1%) on bioavailability and tolerance of nickel in <i>Calendula tripterocarpa</i> grown in a soil spiked with Ni (100 and 150\u2009mg/kg soil) was investigated. The results showed that Ni toxicity significantly reduced plant growth and content of chlorophyll <i>a, b</i> but increased carotenoid levels, lipid peroxidation, and catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in roots and shoots. The Ni bioaccumulation was significantly higher in shoots than roots. The soil amendment with chitosan reduced Ni bioavailability in soil, as well as lowered the biological accumulation of Ni in roots and shoots, and Ni transfer to leaves. The chitosan application also increased growth parameters and levels of chlorophyll <i>a, b</i> and carotenoids under both normal and Ni stress conditions. Furthermore, chitosan reduced the level of malondialdehyde and the activities of SOD and CAT in roots and shoots under Ni stress. In conclusion, results indicated that chitosan through lowering bioavailability of Ni in soils can remarkably relieve adverse effects of Ni toxicity in <i>C. tripterocarpa</i>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Biology Department, Faculty of Science, Shahrekord University, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Heidari", "ForeName": "Javad", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Biology Department, Faculty of Science, Shahrekord University, Shahrekord, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Institute, Shahrekord University, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amooaghaie", "ForeName": "Rayhaneh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Soil Science and Engineering Department, Faculty of Agriculture, Shahrekord University, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kiani", "ForeName": "Shahram", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Phytoremediation", "NlmUniqueID": "101136878", "ISSNLinking": "1522-6514"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7OV03QG267", "NameOfSubstance": "Nickel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9012-76-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Chitosan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YF5Q9EJC8Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calendula"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chitosan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nickel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32270687", "10.1080/15226514.2020.1748564"]}}]}
