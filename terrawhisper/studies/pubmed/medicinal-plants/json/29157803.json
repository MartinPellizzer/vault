Further, to identify the putative role of PPAR-\u03b3 receptors for the protective effect of IGs, an additional group of mice were pretreated with PPAR-\u03b3 antagonist BADGE (5\u202fmg/kg; i.p.) followed by IGs (100\u202fmg/kg; p.o.) for 21 days before CP intoxication.", "IGs pretreatment decreased the hyperalgesic responses toward acetone and heat in acetone drop and tail immersion tests. The abolition of intramyelin odema, cytoplasmic vacuolization and axonal degeneration of sciatic nerve were observed in IGs pretreated mice in a dose-dependent manner. IGs treatment also attenuated the altered serum biochemical markers for renal injury. Furthermore, the treatment prevented renal tubular swelling, granular degeneration and glomerular damage. The levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 in different group revealed the anti-inflammatory effect of IGs, which was further confirmed by improvement in altered expressions of NF-kB in kidney and sciatic serve. Bax/Bcl-2 expressions and caspase 3/9 activity in renal tissues showed the anti-apoptotic effect of IGs. IGs pretreatment also improved the PPAR-\u03b3 expression in the kidney tissues. All the observed protective effects of IGs were suppressed after pretreatment with BADGE.", "Present study concludes that IGs from Picrorhiza kurroa attenuates CP-induced renal toxicity and peripheral neuropathy via PPAR-\u03b3 -mediated pathways."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier GmbH.
