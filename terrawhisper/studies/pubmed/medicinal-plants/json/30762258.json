High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system is used for quantitative determination of phytochemical constituents. The multivariate data analysis (principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis) and heat map data visualisation techniques were performed to classify barberry genotypes using Minitab and GraphPad Prism software, respectively.", "The highest amounts of total phenolics and flavonoids were obtained in fruit extracts of G3 (Berberis vulgaris). The highest total anthocyanin content and antioxidant activity were observed in G8 (B. vulgaris) and G16 (B. vulgaris), respectively. HPLC analysis of phytochemicals (gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid, cinnamic acid, rutin, apigenin, and quercetin) revealed that gallic acid and p-coumaric acid were found as the most abundant phytochemical compounds. Based on multivariate analysis and heat map visualisation techniques, Berberis genotypes were classified into three main clusters.", "These results showed that barberry species (especially B. vulgaris and B. carataegina) are promising sources of natural antioxidants and biochemical compounds beneficial to be used in the food industry and that the multivariate analysis was a suitable approach to classify the barberry samples."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran."}], "LastName": "Gholizadeh-Moghadam", "ForeName": "Naser", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5854-8373"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal and Industrial Plants, Institute of Biotechnology, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Bahman", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5882-8981"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal and Industrial Plants, Institute of Biotechnology, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alirezalu", "ForeName": "Abolfazl", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Institute of Biotechnology, Urmia University", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochem Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "9200492", "ISSNLinking": "0958-0344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthocyanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Anthocyanins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Berberis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30762258", "10.1002/pca.2821"]}}]}
