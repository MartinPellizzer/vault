Bor is one of the most popular traditional Chinese medicines and has been proved to have many effective compounds, such as flavonoids, anthraglycosides, essential oil with cinnamic aldehyde and citral and organic acids. In this article, a new method of ultrahigh pressure extraction (UPE) was used to extract flavonoids from R. sachlinesis. Uniform Design was employed to get the optimum extraction conditions. The optimum UPE conditions were as follows: pressure was 500 MPa; ethanol concentration was 40%; solid/liquid ratio (g mL(-1)) was 1 : 70. The optimum extraction yield of flavonoids was 52.33 mg g(-1). The antioxidant activity of the crude extract was tested with DPPH assay. It showed a higher activity, compared with tertiary butyhydroquinone (TBHQ) at the same concentration (1 mg mL(-1))."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biological and Agricultural Engineering College, Jilin University, Changchun 130022, P.R.
