Among these, essential oils are promising natural compounds for use in scolicidal activity. The targets of our current work were to assess the chemical composition, antioxidant and protoscolicidal activities of Thymus fontanesii essential oil. The essential oil was extracted by hydrodistillation, and chemical compounds were quantified by GC-MS/GC-FID. The in vitro antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH radical scavenging assay and ferric reducing power. Three concentrations of essential oil (4.625, 9.25, and 13.875\u00a0mg/ml) were tested for 5, 10, and 15\u00a0min against E. granulosus protoscoleces and their viability was assessed by eosin staining essay. The yield of the essential oil was 2.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.41 % (w/w). Carvacrol (59.68 %) was the main compound of Thymus fontanesii essential oils. Moreover, Thymus fontanesii essential oil has an antioxidant activity IC<sub>50</sub> of 346.08\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and EC<sub>50</sub> of 869.82\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Furthermore, 100 % mortality of protoscoleces was observed at the doses of 9.25\u00a0mg/ml and 13.875\u00a0mg/ml after 5\u00a0min of exposure. Our findings show a potency of antioxidant and protoscolicidal activities against protoscoleces of E. granulosus."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
