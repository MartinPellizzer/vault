This drug-monitoring study investigated 12 weeks of treatment with St. John's Wort, one tablet three times daily (900 mg Hypericum, Kira), in 111 women from a general medical practice. The patients, who were between 43 and 65 years old, had climacteric symptoms characteristic of the pre- and postmenopausal state. Treatment outcome was evaluated by the Menopause Rating Scale, a self-designed questionnaire for assessing sexuality, and the Clinical Global Impression scale. The incidence and severity of typical psychological, psychosomatic, and vasomotor symptoms were recorded at baseline and after 5, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. Substantial improvement in psychological and psychosomatic symptoms was observed. Climacteric complaints diminished or disappeared completely in the majority of women (76.4% by patient evaluation and 79.2% by physician evaluation). Of note, sexual well-being also improved after treatment with St. John's Wort extract."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lichtwer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grube", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walper", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wheatley", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Adv Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "8611864", "ISSNLinking": "0741-238X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Coitus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Menopause"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Psychophysiologic Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Self-Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10623319", "175"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
