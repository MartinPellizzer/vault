(Zingiberaceae), commonly known as cassumunar-ginger, is a folk remedy for the treatment of inflammations, sprains, rheumatism and asthma. The aim of the present study was to assess the chemical composition, and antibacterial, antifungal, allelopathic and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities of the essential oil of Z. montanum originating from India.", "The hydrodistilled essential oil of Z. montanum rhizome was analyzed using gas chromatography-flame ionization detection and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 49 constituents, forming 98.7-99.9% of the total oil compositions, was identified. The essential oil was characterized by higher amount of monoterpene hydrocarbons (32.6-43.5%), phenylbutanoids (27.5-41.2%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (11.4-34.1%). Major constituents of the oil were sabinene (13.5-38.0%), (E)-1-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene (DMPBD) (20.6-35.3%), terpinen-4-ol (9.0-31.3%), \u03b3-terpinene (1.1-4.8%) and \u03b2-phellandrene (1.0-4.4%). The oil was evaluated against eight pathogenic bacteria and two fungal strains. It exhibited low to good antibacterial activity (minimum inhibitory concentration: 125-500 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup> ) and moderate antifungal activity (250 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup> ) against the tested strains. The oil reduced germination (69.8%) and inhibited the root and shoot growth of lettuce significantly (LD<sub>50</sub> : 3.58 \u00b5L plate<sup>-1</sup> ). However, it did not demonstrate acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity up to a concentration of 10 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> .", "The essential oil of Z. montanum can be used as a potential source of DMPBD, terpinen-4-ol and sabinene for pharmaceutical products. The results of the present study add significant information to the pharmacological activity of Z. montanum native to India. \u00a9 2017 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation":
