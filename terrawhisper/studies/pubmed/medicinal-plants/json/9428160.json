Their structures were established by extensive NMR experiments and chemical methods. Compounds 1-3 comprised acacic acid as the aglycon and either monoterpene carboxylic acid and its xyloside or monoterpene carboxylic acid as the acyl moiety at C-21. The oligosaccharide moieties linked to C-3 and C-28 were determined as alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1-->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1 -->6)- [beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl and alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl-(1-->4)-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->3)]-alpha- rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester, respectively. Compound 4 was established as an echinocystic acid 3-O-glycoside having the same sugar sequences as 1-3. Also obtained in this investigation was the known compound 5, which was identified as echinocystic acid 3-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl- (1-->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1-->6)-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 -->2)]- beta-D-glucopyranoside."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokushima Bunri University, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yoshikawa", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Suzaki", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tanaka", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Arihara", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nigam", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardment"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9428160", "10.1021/np9703555", "np9703555"]}}]}
