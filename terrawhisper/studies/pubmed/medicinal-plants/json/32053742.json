However, the study of radical scavenging-capacity of phenyl myristate is limited by its relatively low abundance in medicinal plants. We have studied the isolation, structure-elucidation, and bioactivities of high-performance thin-layer chromatography validated phenyl myristate from hydroalcohol-extract of bark of H. nepalense. The chemical structure of phenyl myristate was elucidated by spectroscopic methods. The chromatography was performed on high-performance thin-layer chromatography aluminum plates coated with silica-gel 60 F<sub>254</sub> . Determination and quantitation of phenyl myristate were performed by densitometric-scanning at 254\u00a0nm (chloroform-methanol, 9:1, v/v; R<sub>f</sub> 0.49). The method was validated according to International Council for Harmonisation guidelines in terms of linearity, specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision, robustness, and stability. Linearity-range of phenyl myristate was 100-500\u00a0ng/5\u00a0\u00b5L with correlation-coefficient r<sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a00.9997. Limits of detection and quantitation were 3.35 and 10.17\u00a0ng, respectively. Phenyl myristate showed significant free-radical-scavenging activities in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, oxygen-radical-absorbance-capacity, and ex vivo cell-based-antioxidant-protection-in-erythrocytes assays. Molecular-docking approach of phenyl myristate showed effective binding at active sites of human serum albumin (HSA) with the lowest binding energy (-8.4\u00a0kcal/mol) that was comparable with ascorbic acid (-5.0\u00a0kcal/mol). These studies provide mechanistic insight into the potential free radical scavenging activities of phenyl myristate."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
