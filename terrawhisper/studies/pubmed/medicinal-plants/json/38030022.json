(Lamiaceae) is a medicinal plant native to Mediterranean regions and found in other parts of the world. Extracts and essential oil from this widely cultivated culinary medicinal herb are used in traditional medicine to manage a variety of disorders that include epilepsy and pain.", "To assess the anti-nociceptive potentials of Melissa officinalis essential oil (MO) and probe the involvement of adrenergic, opioidergic, serotonergic and potassium adenosine triphosphate (K<sub>ATP</sub>) mechanisms in its anti-nociceptive effects.", "We employed formalin-, acetic acid and hot plate-induced nociception to study the acute anti-nociceptive effects of MO. The sciatic nerve injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain was utilized to study the anti-nociceptive effects of MO on chronic pain. Effects of MO on anxiety, cognitive deficits, oxidative stress and inflammation in the CCI rats were evaluated on elevated plus maze, open field test, novel object recognition, oxidative stress parameters and pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively. The possible mechanism(s) of MO's anti-nociceptive effects were elucidated using prazosin, yohimbine, propranolol, glibenclimide, naloxone and metergoline, which are acknowledged antagonists for \u03b11-, \u03b12- and \u03b2-adrenergic, potassium adenosine triphosphate (K<sub>ATP</sub>), opioidergic and serotonergic systems, respectively.", "MO significantly attenuated acetic acid- and formalin-induced nociception; prolonged the mean reaction time of rats on hot plate before and following sciatic nerve chronic injury (CCI). MO ameliorated anxiety, cognitive deficits and oxidative stress, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and produced a near total restoration of injured sciatic nerves in CCI rats. Naloxone, metergoline and glibenclimide significantly blocked, while prazosin, yohimbine and popranolol failed to block the anti-nociceptive effects of MO in formalin-induced nociception.", "MO contains biologically active compounds with potential anti-nociceptive properties that modulate K<sub>ATP,</sub> opioidergic and serotonergic pathways. These support the development of bioactive compounds from MO as anti-nociceptive agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
