The extracts of medicinal plants are actively tested as protectors. In connection with this, the aim of the research was to determine the effectiveness of the protective properties of <i>Silybum marianum</i> extract against the drugs 'etoposide' and 'methotrexate' at concentrations of 800\u2009\u03bcg/kg using the model object <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. To analyse the protective properties, the following research methods were applied: determining the lethal concentration, average individual fertility of individuals, mortality of F<sub>1</sub> offspring at embryonic stages, SMART (a method for determining the frequency of somatic mutations and recombinations) and assessing the intensity of programmed cell death. The study revealed that a 5% <i>S. marianum</i> extract reduces the genotoxicity of etoposide and exhibits a high cytotoxic effect, both independently and in combination with etoposide and methotrexate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biodiversity and Bioecology, Ural Federal University named after the First President of Russia B.N.
