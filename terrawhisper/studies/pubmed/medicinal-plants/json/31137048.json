They have also often been endowed with a social or cultural significance in religious or cult rituals or for hunting. Initial chemical studies focused on the protein or peptide content but recently the interest extended to smaller molecules. Latex has been found to contain a broad range of specialized metabolites such as terpenoids, cardenolides, alkaloids, and phenolics, which are partly responsible for their antibacterial, antifungal, anthelmintic, cytotoxic, and insect-repellent activities. The diversity in biology and chemistry of latexes is supposedly associated to their ecological roles in interactions with exogenous factors. Latexes contain unique compounds that are different to those found in their bearing plants. Exploring the feasibility of plant latex as a new type of bioactive chemical resource, this review paper covers the chemical characterization of plant latexes, extending this to various other plant exudates. Also, the factors influencing this chemical differentiation and the production, transportation, and chemistry of the latex exudates are described, based on ecological and biochemical mechanisms. We also proposed a latex coagulation model involving 4 general conserved steps. Therefore, the inherent defensive origin of latexes is recognized as their most valuable character and encourages one to pay attention to these materials as alternative sources to discover metabolites with insecticidal or antimicrobial activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biology, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands."}], "LastName": "Salom\u00e9 Abarca", "ForeName": "Luis Francisco", "Initials": "LF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biology, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands."}], "LastName": "Klinkhamer", "ForeName": "Peter G L", "Initials": "PGL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biology, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Young Hae", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Latex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Latex"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31137048", "10.1055/a-0923-8215"]}}]}
