The cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin A (vacA) genes were found in 67.7 and 93.5% of H. pylori patients, respectively. The cagA gene was found to be associated with 100% of patients with duodenal erosion and ulceration identified via endoscopy examination. In addition, 86.7% of patients with cancerous and precancerous lesions, glandular atrophy, and intestinal metaplasia identified via histopathology examination. The vacA s1m1 mutation was associated with more severe forms of gastric erosion and ulceration, as well as the presence of precancerous and cancerous lesions. Eighteen (64.3%) of the twenty-eight isolates were classified as multi-drug resistant (MDR) or pan-drug resistant (PDR) H. pylori. Due to a resurgence of interest in alternative therapies derived from plants as a result of H. pylori resistance to the majority of commonly used antibiotics, the inhibitory activity of five essential oils extracted from some commonly used medicinal plants was evaluated in vitro against drug-resistant H. pylori clinical isolates. Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil demonstrated the highest anti-H. pylori activity when compared to the other essential oils tested. Cinnamaldehyde was the most abundant compound in C. zeylanicum (65.91%). The toxicological evaluation established the safety of C. zeylanicum oil for human use. As a result, C. zeylanicum essential oil may represent a novel antibacterial agent capable of combating drug-resistant H. pylori carrying cytotoxin genes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biofuels Institute, School of the Environment and Safety Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212013, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botany Department, Faculty of Science, Tanta University, Tanta, 31527, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Sameh S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biofuels Institute, School of the Environment and Safety Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212013, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botany Department, Faculty of Science, Tanta University, Tanta, 31527, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abd Elnabi", "ForeName": "Manar K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Alkherkhisy", "ForeName": "Mohammad M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hasan", "ForeName": "Abdulkarim", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province 150090, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Fanghua", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biology Department, College of Science, Taif University, P.O.
