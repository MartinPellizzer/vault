The refractory viral infections resistant to available antiviral drugs are alarming threats and a serious health concern. For viral hepatitis, the interferon and vaccine therapies solely are not ultimate solutions due to recurrence of hepatitis C virus. Owing to the growing incidences of viral infections and especially of resistant viral strains, the available therapeutic modalities need to be improved, complemented with the discovery of novel antiviral agents to combat refractory viral infections. It is widely accepted that medicinal plant heritage is nature gifted, precious, and fueled with the valuable resources for treatment of metabolic and infectious disorders. The aims of this review are to assemble the facts and to conclude the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants in the eradication and management of various viral diseases such as influenza, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis, and coxsackievirus infections, which have been proven in diverse clinical studies. The articles, published in the English language since 1982 to 2017, were included from Web of Science, Cochrane Library, AMED, CISCOM, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, and PubMed by using relevant keywords including plants possessing antiviral activity, the antiviral effects of plants, and plants used in viral disorders. The scientific literature mainly focusing on plant extracts and herbal products with therapeutic efficacies against experimental models of influenza, HIV, HSV, hepatitis, and coxsackievirus were included in the study. Pure compounds possessing antiviral activity were excluded, and plants possessing activity against viruses other than viruses in inclusion criteria were excluded. Hundreds of plant extracts with antiviral effect were recognized. However, the data from only 36 families investigated through in vitro and in vivo studies met the inclusion criteria of this review. The inferences from scientific literature review, focusing on potential therapeutic consequences of medicinal plants on experimental models of HIV, HSV, influenza, hepatitis, and coxsackievirus have ascertained the curative antiviral potential of plants. Fifty-four medicinal plants belonging to 36 different families having antiviral potential were documented. Out of 54 plants, 27 individually belong to particular plant families. On the basis of the work of several independent research groups, the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants against listed common viral diseases in the region has been proclaimed. In this context, the herbal formulations as alternative medicine may contribute to the eradication of complicated viral infection significantly. The current review consolidates the data of the various medicinal plants, those are Sambucus nigra, Caesalpinia pulcherrima, and Hypericum connatum, holding promising specific antiviral activities scientifically proven through studies on experimental animal models. Consequently, the original research addressing the development of novel nutraceuticals based on listed medicinal plants is highly recommended for the management of viral disorders."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7457-8572"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine and Surgery, Directorate of Medical Sciences, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akram", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1480-5654"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Allied Health Professionals, Directorate of Medical Sciences, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Tahir", "ForeName": "Imtiaz Mahmood", "Initials": "IM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5451-9137"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine and Surgery, Directorate of Medical Sciences, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Syed Muhammad Ali", "Initials": "SMA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Mahmood", "ForeName": "Zahed", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Allied Health Professionals, Directorate of Medical Sciences, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Altaf", "ForeName": "Awais", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine, University College of Conventional Medicine, Islamia University, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Khalil", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Munir", "ForeName": "Naveed", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Eastern Medicine, Hamdard University, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Daniyal", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Government College Women University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Nasir", "ForeName": "Suhaila", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7070-0342"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Government College Women University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Mehboob", "ForeName": "Huma", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Coxsackievirus Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "HIV"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "HIV Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Herpes Simplex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Influenza, Human"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Simplexvirus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29356205", "10.1002/ptr.6024"]}}]}
