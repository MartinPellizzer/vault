The water-soluble fraction was subjected to column chromatography on macro resin AB-8, and the final products were obtained by repeated reversed-phase ODS and MCI gel CHP 20P column chromatography. Structures of compounds were elucidated by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 135DEPT, HMQC, HMBC and TOCSY spectroscopic analyses. A new steroidal saponin was isolated, which was identified as (25R)-26-O-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-furost-5-en-3 beta, 16, 20, 26-tetraol-22-seco-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1--> 3)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1--> 4)-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)]-beta-D-glucopyranoside. The compound is a novel skeletally steroidal saponin, named as zingiberenin F (1). It was reported for the first time from D. zingiberensis Wright."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214036, China. xdp1219@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "De-ping", "Initials": "DP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Chang-ying", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao-chun", "Initials": "XC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pang", "ForeName": "Zi-jie", "Initials": "ZJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "26-O-glucopyranosyl-furost-5-en-3,16,20,26-tetraol-22-seco-3-O-glucopyranosyl-1-3-glucopyranosyl-1-4-(rhamnopyranosyl-1-2)glucopyranoside"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dioscorea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19350822"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
