A wide variety of formulations indigenous to the Unani medicine have been preserved over the years. These formulations are potent and effective even after ages of postformulation. Rose petals are an example of such an herb, which is extensively and popularly used in Unani formulations for edible and cosmetic purposes. Rose petals are rich in terpenes, glycosides, flavonoids, and anthocyanins.", "The aim of this study was to characterize the phytochemical profiling of different rose varieties and their marketed formulations.", "HPTLC method was developed for detecting overall profile and assessing variations among the rose varieties available in market along with the popular formulations of rose such as gulkand (Brand A and Brand B), Arq-e-gulab or Gulab Jal (Brand C), and sharbat (Brand D). GC-MS analysis was also carried out for fingerprinting of rose varieties and formulations.", "HPTLC and GC-MS fingerprinting showed some common peaks in rose samples as well as in the formulation samples. The methods also gave different peaks for the adulterant that might be used in place of rose.", "Both the methods could be used for standardization of herbal products containing rose as one of the ingredients and also used to check for the adulteration.", "The current advanced chromatographic analysis is a valuable tool to determine the quality of the formulation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a92020 by AOAC International, Inc.
