These three strains, which were isolated from minimally-processed vegetables, were shown to grow in culture broth at 4, 8, 15 and 30 degrees C. However, only Ent. mundtii was capable of bacteriocin production at 4-8 degrees C. Examination of the growth of these strains on agar under 1.5% O2 in combination with 0, 5, 20 or 50% CO2 revealed significantly higher maximum specific growth rates for Ent. mundtii than for Pediococcus parvulus at CO2 concentrations below 20%, which are relevant for MA-storage of vegetables. Enterococcus mundtii was subsequently evaluated for its ability to control the growth of L. monocytogenes on vegetable agar and fresh mungbean sprouts under 1.5% O2/20% CO2/78.5% N2 at 8 degrees C. The growth of L. monocytogenes was inhibited by bacteriocinogenic Ent. mundtii on sterile vegetable-medium but not on fresh produce. However, mundticin, the bacteriocin produced by Ent. mundtii, was found to have potential as a biopreservative agent for MA-stored mungbean sprouts when used in a washing step or a coating procedure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agrotechnological Research Institute, Wageningen, The Netherlands. m.h.j.bennik@ato.dlo.nl"}], "LastName": "Bennik", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "van Overbeek", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Smid", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gorris", "ForeName": "L G", "Initials": "LG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Lett Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8510094", "ISSNLinking": "0266-8254"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacteriocins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteriocins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Enterococcus"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Listeria monocytogenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pediococcus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Streptococcaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10196774", "10.1046/j.1365-2672.1999.00497.x"]}}]}
