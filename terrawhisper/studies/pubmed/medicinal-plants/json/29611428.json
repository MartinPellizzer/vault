In order to construct an efficient anti-inflammatory drug screening platform, we engineered yeast as a double-molecule carrier, of which an inserted domain (I domain) of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 was displayed on yeast surface and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) was expressed inside cytosol. The I domain specifically targeted a surface marker of mammalian cells, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, whose number is correlated with the level of cellular inflammation. Examination of GFP intensity enables swift quantification of the yeast-mammalian cell binding and thus it reflects inflammatory potency, herein the inflammatory index, of a chemical imposed to cells. The inflammatory potency of a total of 1340 chemicals was indexed. Among them, 1 inflammation-inducing and 1 inflammation-reducing compounds were verified both in vitro and in vivo. Our method demonstrated a swift, facile and high-throughput screening platform at the protein level for inflammation and related diseases drug discovery without using sophisticated instruments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Drug Discovery and Molecular Engineering, Department of Medicinal Plants, College of Plant Science and Technology , Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU) , Wuhan , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center (Hubei) for Medicinal Plant Breeding and Cultivation , Wuhan , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Hubei Provincial Engineering Research Center for Medicinal Plants , Wuhan , China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qiyun", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Hubei Cancer Hospital , Wuhan , China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Sheng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology , HZAU , Wuhan , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f College of Veterinary Medicine , HZAU , Wuhan , China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology , HZAU , Wuhan , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f College of Veterinary Medicine , HZAU , Wuhan , China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Drug Discovery and Molecular Engineering, Department of Medicinal Plants, College of Plant Science and Technology , Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU) , Wuhan , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center (Hubei) for Medicinal Plant Breeding and Cultivation , Wuhan , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Hubei Provincial Engineering Research Center for Medicinal Plants , Wuhan , China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiaohua", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Drug Discovery and Molecular Engineering, Department of Medicinal Plants, College of Plant Science and Technology , Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU) , Wuhan , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center (Hubei) for Medicinal Plant Breeding and Cultivation , Wuhan , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Hubei Provincial Engineering Research Center for Medicinal Plants , Wuhan , China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Mo", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Drug Discovery and Molecular Engineering, Department of Medicinal Plants, College of Plant Science and Technology , Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU) , Wuhan , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center (Hubei) for Medicinal Plant Breeding and Cultivation , Wuhan , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Hubei Provincial Engineering Research Center for Medicinal Plants , Wuhan , China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Xuebo", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101594777", "ISSNLinking": "2169-1401"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29611428", "10.1080/21691401.2018.1457539"]}}]}
