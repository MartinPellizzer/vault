Recent studies have demonstrated that safranal, an active constituent of Crocus sativus, has several pharmacological effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Since there is no data about the impact of safranal on MS, this study was designed to investigate the protective effect of safranal on OLN-93 oligodendrocytes injury induced by GA or QA.", "At first, the potential toxic effect of safranal on OLN-93 viability was evaluated. Also, the cells were pretreated with safranal (0.1, 1, 10, 50, 100 and 200\u2009\u03bcM) for 2\u2009h and then subjected to GA (16\u2009mM) or QA (8\u2009mM) toxicity for 24\u2009h, in which the same treatments were applied. The cell viability and parameters of redox status such as the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation were measured.", "Safranal at concentration ranges of 1-800\u2009\u03bcM had no toxic effect on cell viability (p>0.05). Treatment with safranal significantly increased cell viability following GA or QA insults at concentrations higher than 1\u2009\u03bcM (p<0.01). The cytoprotective potential of safranal was also accompanied by decreased ROS accumulation (p<0.001) and malondialdehyde level (p<0.001) following GA or QA insults.", "The data suggests that safranal exhibits oligoprotection potential by means of inhibiting oxidative stress parameters."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alavi", "ForeName": "Mohaddeseh Sadat", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fanoudi", "ForeName": "Sahar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fard", "ForeName": "Ameneh Veisi", "Initials": "AV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soukhtanloo", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Barzegar", "ForeName": "Hanif", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghnia", "ForeName": "Hamid R", "Initials": "HR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Drug Res (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101602406", "ISSNLinking": "2194-9379"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neurotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3KX376GY7L", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutamic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4393FR07EA", "NameOfSubstance": "safranal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "F6F0HK1URN", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinolinic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Glutamic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Multiple Sclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Neurotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Oligodendroglia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Quinolinic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}], "CoiStatement": "No conflicts of interest declared."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30463091", "10.1055/a-0790-8200"]}}]}
