As of July 25th, there are 16.5 million global cumulative confirmed cases, 9.4 million cumulative recovered cases and 0.65 million deaths. There is a tremendous necessity of supervising and estimating future COVID-19 cases to control the spread and help countries prepare their healthcare systems. In this study, time-series models - Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) are used to forecast the epidemiological trends of the COVID-19 pandemic for top-16 countries where 70%-80% of global cumulative cases are located. Initial combinations of the model parameters were selected using the auto-ARIMA model followed by finding the optimized model parameters based on the best fit between the predictions and test data. Analytical tools Auto-Correlation function (ACF), Partial Auto-Correlation Function (PACF), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were used to assess the reliability of the models. Evaluation metrics Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) were used as criteria for selecting the best model. A case study was presented where the statistical methodology was discussed in detail for model selection and the procedure for forecasting the COVID-19 cases of the USA. Best model parameters of ARIMA and SARIMA for each country are selected manually and the optimized parameters are then used to forecast the COVID-19 cases. Forecasted trends for confirmed and recovered cases showed an exponential rise for countries such as the United States, Brazil, South Africa, Colombia, Bangladesh, India, Mexico and Pakistan. Similarly, trends for cumulative deaths showed an exponential rise for countries Brazil, South Africa, Chile, Colombia, Bangladesh, India, Mexico, Iran, Peru, and Russia. SARIMA model predictions are more realistic than that of the ARIMA model predictions confirming the existence of seasonality in COVID-19 data. The results of this study not only shed light on the future trends of the COVID-19 outbreak in top-16 countries but also guide these countries to prepare their health care policies for the ongoing pandemic.
