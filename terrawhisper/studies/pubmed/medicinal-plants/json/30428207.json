Therefore the aim of this research was to evaluate the content of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn and As in selected and frequently used medicinal plants, including chicory, broadleaf, common comfrey and dandelion. The plant material was collected from their wild habitats in the area of highly developed power plant activity during the summer of 2015. Plant analyses were done according to ICP methodology, using ICAP 6300 ICP optical emission spectrometer. The obtained results showed that the content of As, Cd, Co, Mn, Ni and Zn in the investigated medicinal plant species was below the maximum permissible concentration, while in all parts of all studied plants the concentration of Cr was toxic. The toxic concentrations of Cu were determined in root and aerial parts of chicory and common comfrey, and the toxic concentrations of Fe in root and aerial parts of dandelion and broadleaf plantain, and in aerial parts of common comfrey. However, high but not toxic content of Pb was found in aerial parts of chicory. It can be concluded that medicinal plants from the studied growing site are not appropriate for use in alternative medicine and that a determination of trace metals content in these plants must become a standard criterion for evaluation of their quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stanojkovi\u0107-Sebi\u0107", "ForeName": "Aleksandra", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maksimovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Jelena", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dini\u0107", "ForeName": "Zoran", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Po\u0161ti\u0107", "ForeName": "Dobrivoj", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ili\u0107i\u0107", "ForeName": "Renata", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stanojkovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Aleksandar", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Commun", "NlmUniqueID": "101477873", "ISSNLinking": "1555-9475"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Power Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30428207"]}}]}
