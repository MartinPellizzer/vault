Cumulative concentrations of berberine (20, 65, 200 and 600 \u03bcg/mL) were added on pre-contracted TSM by methacholine or KCl in non-incubated or incubated tissues with atropine, chlorpheniramine, propranolol, diltiazem, glibenclamide, indomethacin, L-NG-nitro arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and papaverine. The relaxant effects of theophylline (0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 mM) as positive control and saline (1 mL) as negative control were also examined in non-incubated tissues. Berberine showed significant and concentration-dependent relaxant effects in non-incubated tissues contracted by KCl and methacholine (p<0.01 to p<0.001). There was no significant difference in the relaxant effects of berberine between non-incubated and incubated tissues with atropine, propranolol, diltiazem, glibenclamide, and papaverine. The relaxant effects of second concentrations of berberine in incubated tissues with L-NAME, its three lower concentration in incubated tissues with chlorpheniramine and its all concentrations in incubated tissues with indomethacin were significantly lower than non-incubated tissues (p<0.05 to p<0.001). The EC50 values of berberine in incubated tissues with chlorpheniramine was significantly higher than the non-incubated condition (p<0.05). Our findings reveal a relatively potent relaxant effect of berberine that is lower than the effect of theophylline. Proposed mechanisms for the relaxant effect of berberine are histamine (H1) receptor blockade, inhibition of cyclooxygenase pathways and/or nitric oxide formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran AND Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. saadats931@mums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Saadat", "ForeName": "Saeideh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran AND Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. farzanenaghdi69@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Naghdi", "ForeName": "Farzaneh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran AND Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. ghoranisv@mums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Ghorani", "ForeName": "Vahideh", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. rakhshandehh@mums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Rakhshandeh", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran AND Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. boskabadymh@mums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Boskabady", "ForeName": "Mohammad Hosein", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "101146178", "ISSNLinking": "1735-1502"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bronchodilator Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Histamine H1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0I8Y3P32UF", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "660YQ98I10", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchodilator Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Smooth"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Histamine H1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31522439", "10.18502/ijaai.v18i3.1125"]}}]}
