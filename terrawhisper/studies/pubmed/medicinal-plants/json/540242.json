It was shown that feeding of mustard seed oil at 40% of the daily caloric requirement resulted in a deposition of cardiac triacylglycerols containing a high proportion of enantiomers of a positional distribution and molecular association of fatty acids which were closely similar to those found in the dietary oil. Complete structures were derived for a total of 88 species representing 75 to 85% of the triacylglycerols. About 90% of the accumulated triacylglycerol contained at least one long-chain (C20--C22) monounsaturated fatty acid per molecule. The long-chain acids were confined mainly to the primary positions and preferentially to the sn-3-position of the glycerol molecule. The dietary lipidosis, is, therefore, accompanied by little or no accumulation of the normal rat tissue triacylglycerols containing C16 and C18 fatty acids. It is suggested that the deposition and eventual clearance of the enantiomeric long-chain triacylglycerols in the rat heart during mustard seed oil feeding may be largely a result of a gradual change in specificity of the cardiac lipases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Myher", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kuksis", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vasdev", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kako", "ForeName": "K J", "Initials": "KJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0421034", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4018"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fats"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fats"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Diglycerides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mustard Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["540242", "10.1139/o79-175"]}}]}
