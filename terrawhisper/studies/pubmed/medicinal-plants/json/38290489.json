Although modern medicine has made strides in treatment, a complete cure for cancer remains elusive.", "Utilization of medicinal plants in traditional medicine for the treatment of multiple diseases, including cancer, is a well-established practice. Sinomenine is an alkaloid extracted from a medicinal plant and has a diverse range of biological properties, including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial effects. Sinomenine exhibits inhibitory effects on various types of tumor cells, including breast, lung, and liver cancers. The anticancer properties of sinomenine are believed to involve stimulation of apoptosis and autophagy as well as suppression of cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis.", "This review summarizes the current research on sinomenine's potential as an anticancer agent, which may contribute to the discovery of more effective cancer treatments."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 S.
