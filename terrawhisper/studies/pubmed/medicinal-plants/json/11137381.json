EV.EXT 33 was administered by oral gavage in concentrations of 100, 333, and 1000 mg/kg, to three groups of 22 pregnant female rats from days 6 to 15 of gestation. For comparison, a fourth group received the vehicle, sesame oil. Body weight and food and water intake were recorded during the treatment period. The rats were killed on day 21 of gestation and examined for standard parameters of reproductive performance. The fetuses were examined for signs of teratogenic and toxic effects.EV.EXT 33 was well tolerated. No deaths or treatment-related adverse effects were observed. Weight gain and food consumption were similar in all groups during gestation. Reproductive performance was not affected by treatment with EV.EXT 33. The examination of fetuses for external, visceral, and skeletal changes showed no embryotoxic or teratogenic effects of EV.EXT 33. Based on these results, it was concluded that EV.EXT 33, when administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, caused neither maternal nor developmental toxicity at daily doses of up to 1000 mg/kg body weight."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Drug Analysis A/S, Symbion Science Park, Fruebjergvej 3, DK-2100, Copenhagen, Denmark. msw@ida@symbion.dk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weidner", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sigwart", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Reprod Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8803591", "ISSNLinking": "0890-6238"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abnormalities, Drug-Induced"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["abnormalities"], "DescriptorName": "Bone and Bones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zingiber officinale"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11137381", "10.1016/s0890-6238(00)00116-7", "S0890623800001167"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
