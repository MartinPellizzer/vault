Macleaya cordata (Willd.) is a draught-tolerant medicinal plant that has been proposed as a pioneer crop to be cultivated in arid areas. However, the exact molecular mechanisms through which M. cordata responds to draught stress remain elusive. In recent years, microRNA (miRNAs) in plants have been associated with stress response. Based on these findings, the current study aimed to shed light on the potential regulatory roles of miRNAs in the draught tolerance of M. cordata by employing high-throughput RNA sequencing and degradation sequencing. Six M. cordata plants were randomly divided into two equal experiment groups, including one draught group and one control group. High-throughput sequencing of the M. cordata samples led to the identification of 895 miRNAs, of which 18 showed significantly different expression levels between the two groups. PsRobot analysis and degradation sequencing predicted the differential miRNAs to target 59 and 36 genes, respectively. Functional analysis showed that 38 of the predicted genes could be implicated in the modulation of stress response. Four miRNAs and eight target genes were selected for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) validation. The expression trend of each miRNA analyzed by qRT-PCR was consistent with that determined by sequencing, and was negatively correlated with those of its target genes. The results of our current study supported the involvement of miRNAs in the draught tolerance of M. cordata and could pave the way for further investigation into the related regulatory mechanisms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
