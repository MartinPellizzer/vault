The lead poisoning model was established by peritoneally injecting mice with 70 mg / kg lead acetate every day for 8 days. After the total flavonoids of Eucommia ulmoides was gavaged for 14 days, mice were sacrificed and immediately subjected to necropsy. The concentration of lead in blood, spleen and thymus were determined. The spleen and thymus index and the content of T-SOD\u3001GSH-Px\u3001T-AOC and MDA of spleen and thymus in mice were assayed.", "Intraperitoneal injection of 70 mg / kg lead acetate for 8 consecutive days could cause an immunity decline in lead poisoning mice, the total flavonoids of Eucommiaulmoides could significantly improve the immunity of lead poisoning mice. After the total flavonoids of Eucommia ulmoides was gavaged for 14 days, the viscera index in mice induced by lead acetate was significantly improve( P < 0. 01). Compared with lead group, the total flavonoids of Eucommia ulmoides( 200 mg / kg) could significantly reduce the lead contents in blood, spleen and thymus and improve the activities of T-SOD\u3001GSH-Px\u3001TAOC and reduce the content of MDA of mouse spleen and thymus( P < 0. 01), while there were no significant changes in concentrations of the lead contents in blood, spleen and thymus in the total flavonoids of Eucommia ulmoides( 50 mg / kg) treatment group.
