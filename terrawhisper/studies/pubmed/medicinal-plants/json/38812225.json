Few studies discriminate the quality markers(Q-markers) conferring different therapeutic effects of traditional Chinese medicine preparations. Therefore, we take Aidi Injection(AD) as an example to comprehensively identify the Q-markers of anti-tumor and cardioprotective effects based on the &quot;spider web&quot; mode. Firstly, based on the principle of measurability, the chemical components in the prescription were qualitatively analyzed, and then the components with high content and capable to be measured were quantitatively analyzed as measurable evaluation indexes. Based on the principle of stability, the effects of light and temperature on the content of each component of AD were investigated as indicators of stability. Based on the principle of compatibility, the compounds were classified according to the law of compatibility of sovereign, minister, assistant, and guide medicinal materials in the prescription. Based on the principle of efficacy, the anti-tumor and antiangiogenic activities of the Q-markers were evaluated, and their synergistic effects with doxorubicin(DOX) in inhibiting tumorigenesis and angiogenesis and lowering cardiotoxicity were evaluated as the evaluation indexes of effectiveness. The seven-dimensional spider web of &quot;compatibility-content-stability-antitumor activity-synergistic anti-tumor activity with DOX-antiangiogenic activity-synergistic anti-angiogenic activity with DOX&quot; and the four-dimensional spider web of &quot;compatibility-content-stability-protective effects against DOX-induced myocardial toxicity&quot; were established, on the basis of which the Q-markers of anti-tumor and cardioprotective effects of AD were comprehensively analyzed. The results showed that 12 components were selected as the Q-markers of AD, among which cantharidin, ginsenoside Re, ginsenoside Rb_1, astragaloside \u2161, cryptochlorogenic acid, and ginsenoside Rg_2 were the anti-tumor Q-markers of AD. Ginsenoside Rd, isofraxidin, syringin, eleutheroside E, calycosin-7-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside, and azelaic acid were the cardioprotective Q-markers of AD. Taking into account both the anti-tumor and cardioprotective effects, these Q-markers could cover the four herbs constituting the prescription. The findings provides a scientific basis for the quality control of AD and an effective method for identifying comprehensive and reasonable Q-markers for the two effects of Chinese medicinal preparations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Kai-Liang", "Initials": "KL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chun-Hua", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China National Engineering Research Center of Miao's Medicines Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yong-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China National Engineering Research Center of Miao's Medicines Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "English Abstract"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiotonic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "aidi herbal drug"}, {"RegistryNumber": "80168379AG", "NameOfSubstance": "Doxorubicin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiotonic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Doxorubicin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "36"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "35"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38812225", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20231224.201"]}}]}
