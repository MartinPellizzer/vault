The ampelopsin was administered at 3 dosages by intraperitoneal injection daily for 18 days from the day before the cells injection. The B16 mouse melanoma cells were exposed to ampelopsin for 3 days. The effects of ampelopsin on invasion, migration and adhesion of B16 melanoma cells were evaluated with Transwell chambers or attachment with polycarbonate filters and reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel).", "The number of metastases in the animals that were given ampelopsin 150, 200, and 250 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) was significantly reduced as compared to the vehicle control (P<0.05), and the inhibition rates were 30.97%, 40.58%, and 61.16%, respectively. The ability of the ampelopsin treated B16 cells to invade the reconstituted basement membrane was decreased significantly (P<0.01), and the inhibition rates were 36.06%, 59.58%, and 79.09% at 20 micromol x L(-1), 40 micromol x L(-1) and 80 micromol x L(-1) concentration, respectively. Ampelopsin could also inhibit B16 cells migration through PVPF in the Transwell chambers, and the inhibition rates were 51.59%, 56.51%, and 66.75% at 20 micromol x L(-1), 40 micromol x L(-1) and 80 micromol x L(-1), respectively (P<0.01).
