In addition, this is the first report on MIC, MBC/MFC antimicrobial activities of above mentioned plants and also identify the phytochemical, functional groups by GC-MS and FT-IR respectively. Soxhlet extraction method was used for preparation of different extracts viz., aqueous, petroleum ether, ethyl acetate and methanol. The extracts were examined against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecallis, Salmonella paratyphi, Shigella dysenteriae, Candida albicans and Mycobacterium tuberculosis by agar well diffusion method, and Minimum Inhibitory Concentratioon (MIC), Minimum Bactericidal/Fungicidal Concentration (MBC/MFC) values were determined through micro dilution method. Phytochemical analysis of compounds was carried out by GC-MS analysis and functional groups were identified by FT-IR. Based on the outcome of our results, Ethyl acetate extract Showed significant antimicrobial activity against the tested pathogens especially, for C. albicans (40\u202fmm) followed by ethyl acetate of S. asper against S. paratyphi (38\u202fmm). While, the least inhibition was observed with aqueous extract of T. terrestris against S. paratyphi (10\u202fmm). The MIC ranged from 3.21\u202fmg/ml to 50\u202fmg/ml and MBC/MFC 6.25\u202fmg/ml to 50\u202fmg/ml was recorded. Ethyl acetate extracts of almost all samples showed better activity than other extracts in inhibition growth of pathogens. Phytochemical analysis exhibited the presence of Steroids, tannins and cardiac glycosides were found only in ethyl acetate extract of C. zeylanica. Functional group of leaf extract was confirmed by FT-IR spectrum and GC-MS analysis of the ethyl acetate extract revealed the presence of 20 compounds. The results revealed that ethyl acetate extract of C. zeylanica leaves has potential activity than the other extracts as well as standard drugs (Gentamycin and Ketocozole). Hence, this plant may be recommended for further studies in isolation of active compounds and related pharmacological activities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
