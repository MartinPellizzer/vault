Methanolic extracts of the formulations were studied in four different in vitro and ex vivo models. Total phenolic content of Chandraprabha Vati and Maha yogaraja Guggulu was found to be 5.24% and 10.74% respectively. Methanolic extracts of the formulations were good scavengers of all the radicals but there was a difference in the activity of the two formulations in different models. Chandraprabha Vati was a good scavenger of superoxide radical and Maha yogaraja Guggulu was efficient in scavenging nitric oxide (NO), while both inhibited lipid peroxidation efficiently. Free radical scavenging activity of the different extracts can be attributed to the presence of various chemical components including phenolics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "B.
