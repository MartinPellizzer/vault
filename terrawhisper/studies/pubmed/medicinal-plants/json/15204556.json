Ninety-seven per cent of the leafy vegetables were contaminated with heavy metals with 39% exceeding the maximum limits for each element. Cadmium was detected in 78 of 116 samples of leafy vegetable, although without any exceeding the maximum limits. However, lead was detected in 99 samples, of which 39 exceeded the maximum limits (0.3 mg kg(-1)) and 56 medicinal plant samples of 70 had lead levels above 0.5 mg kg(-1). Copper was detected in 69 medicinal plant samples, of which 58 samples contained levels higher than 10 mg kg(-1). However, cadmium was only found in 43% of samples with only two of 70 samples above the maximum limit. Seventy-three per cent of the samples of medicinal plants were contaminated with pesticide residues, of which 44% contained amounts that exceeded maximum residue limits. Malathion was the most frequently found pesticide residue, being detected in 203 of 391 (52%.) samples, followed by profenofos, which was detected in 131 of 391 (33%) samples."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Center, Central Laboratory of Residue analysis of Pesticides and Heavy Metals in Food, Dokki, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dogheim", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ashraf", "ForeName": "El M M", "Initials": "el MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alla", "ForeName": "S A G", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khorshid", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fahmy", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Addit Contam", "NlmUniqueID": "8500474", "ISSNLinking": "0265-203X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organophosphorus Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Egypt"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organophosphorus Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15204556", "10.1080/02652030310001656361", "6XNGXJA3A8PFMDB1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
