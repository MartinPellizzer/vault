In this study, we identified a full-length cDNA sequence, vcCyP, encoding cyclophilin (CyP), a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase of guard cell protoplasts (GCPs) from Vicia faba L. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that vcCyP contained 171 amino acid residues and exhibited a strong similarity to previously described cytosolic CyP isoforms from other plants. vcCyP had seven extra amino acid residues, which is a characteristic of the cytosolic form of plant CyPs. A complex of recombinant vcCyP and CsA inhibited the phosphatase activity of bovine calcineurin, a type 2B protein phosphatase, with a half-inhibitory concentration of 0.2 microM. Protein phosphatase activity was measured in the cytosolic fraction of GCPs using a 32P-labeled myelin basic protein (32P-MBP) and the activity was increased by a physiological concentration of Ca2+ (1 microM). This Ca(2+)-stimulated phosphatase activity was inhibited by CsA, suggesting the presence of both cytosolic CyP and calcineurin-like protein phosphatase in guard cells. Northern blot analysis showed that the transcription level of vcCyP was much higher in GCPs than in root and leaf tissues of Vicia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kinoshita", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shimazaki", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["AB012947"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9430925", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0781"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcineurin Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Isoforms"}, {"RegistryNumber": "83HN0GTJ6D", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclosporine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.2.1.8", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptidylprolyl Isomerase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calcineurin Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclosporine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cytosol"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Peptidylprolyl Isomerase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Channels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Isoforms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis, DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10189702", "10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029474"]}}]}
