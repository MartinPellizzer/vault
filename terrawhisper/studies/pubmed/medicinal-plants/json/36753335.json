Cases of human poisoning due to ingestion of PA-contaminated foods have been reported in several countries. Monocrotaline (MCT) is a pyrrolizidine alkaloid from the plants of <i>Crotalaria</i> genus that causes hepatic and cardiopulmonary toxicities, and the exhibition of the toxicities requires the metabolic activation by CYP3A4 to form electrophilic dehydro-monocrotaline (DHM). The present study demonstrated that myeloperoxidase (MPO) also participated in the bioactivation of MCT. <i>N</i>-Chloromonocrotaline was detected in both HClO/MCT incubations and MPO/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/MgCl<sub>2</sub>/MCT incubations. DHM-derived <i>N</i>-acetylcysteine (NAC) conjugates were detected in the above incubations fortified with NAC. Lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation in mice resulted in an elevated level of hepatic MPO activity, increased metabolic activation of MCT, and intensified elevation of serum ALT and AST activity induced by MCT. MPO inhibitor 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide was found to reverse these alterations. <i>Mpo</i>-KO mice were resistant to the observed potentiating effect of inflammation on MCT-induced liver injury. In conclusion, inflammation intensified MCT-induced liver injury. MPO participated in the observed potentiating effect of inflammation on the hepatotoxicity induced by MCT."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou 550004, P.
