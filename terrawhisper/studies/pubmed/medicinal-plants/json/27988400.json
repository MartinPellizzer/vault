Rich.) A.C. Rich decoction is used in Brazilian folk medicine due to its possible antihypertensive effect, this species has never been critically investigated as a hypotensive drug. So, the aim of this study was to evaluate the possible hypotensive and antihypertensive effects of the oral administration of Alibertia edulis aqueous extract (AEAE) in normotensive and hypertensive rats, and evaluate its inter-relation with a possible diuretic activity.", "Different doses of AEAE (20, 65 and 200mg/kg) were tested on the mean arterial pressure (MAP) of normotensive Wistar rats and after induction of renovascular hypertension (two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt model). In addition, the diuretic effects of AEAE were compared with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in an acute and repeated-dose treatment for 7 days. Volume, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium contents, pH and density were estimated in urine samples collected after 8 or 24h. Plasma sodium, potassium, total protein, urea, creatinine, AST and ALT concentrations were measured in samples collected at the end of the experimental period (seventh day). Finally, the antioxidant activity of the AEAE was assessed using the DPPH radical scavenging and ferric ions reducing power assay.", "The intraduodenal administration of the HCTZ and AEAE significantly reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, the MAP in both normotensive and hypertensive rats. Otherwise, the heart rate was not affected by any treatment. Acute and prolonged oral administration of AEAE (200mg/kg) and HCTZ caused a significant increase in volume and urinary concentrations of sodium, potassium and chloride. Moreover, urinary calcium concentration was significantly increased after administration of AEAE (200mg/kg). Finally, AEAE was able to present important in vitro antioxidant properties.", "The results obtained have shown that AEAE presents potent diuretic activity and significant hypotensive and antihypertensive effect. In addition, this study may confirm part of the pharmacological activity popularly attributed to this species and opens perspective for the future use in various renal and cardiovascular diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
