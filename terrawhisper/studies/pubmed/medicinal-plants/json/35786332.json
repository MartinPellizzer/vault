Existing therapies as well as drugs for treating lung cancer are not effective and are often associated with innumerable side effects and toxicities. For these reasons, researchers have been working on developing novel anti-cancer medicines from plants and other natural sources that have a high safety profile. Natural flavonoids are a polyphenolic group of phytochemicals extracted from plants and other plant-derived compounds. Natural flavonoids are gaining popularity due to their unique and priceless medicinal properties, including anticancer properties. Several researchers have already declared that flavonoids possess the ability to treat different cancers, particularly lung cancer. The bioactivity of natural flavonoids is mainly due to their structural diversity. Natural flavonoids fight against lung cancer by regulating redox homeostasis, upregulating apoptosis, pro-apoptotic factors, and survival genes, arresting cell cycle progression, autophagy, reducing cell proliferation and invasiveness, maintaining inflammation response, downregulating anti-apoptotic factors, and targeting lung cancer signaling pathways. Flavonoids can act alone or synergistically with other agents to treat lung cancer. Due to these reasons, it is possible to use natural flavonoids as pharmaceutical leads to prevent and treat lung cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science and Bioinformatics, Assam University, Silchar, Assam, India."}], "LastName": "Nath", "ForeName": "Rajat", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science and Bioinformatics, Assam University, Silchar, Assam, India."}], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "Chandrima", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science and Bioinformatics, Assam University, Silchar, Assam, India."}], "LastName": "Kityania", "ForeName": "Sibashish", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Guru Charan College, Silchar, Assam, India."}], "LastName": "Nath", "ForeName": "Deepa", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science and Bioinformatics, Assam University, Silchar, Assam, India."}], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "Subrata", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science and Bioinformatics, Assam University, Silchar, Assam, India."}], "LastName": "Choudhury", "ForeName": "Manabendra Dutta", "Initials": "MD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Biotechnology & Medical Converged Science, Dongguk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Patra", "ForeName": "Jayanta Kumar", "Initials": "JK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science and Bioinformatics, Assam University, Silchar, Assam, India."}], "LastName": "Talukdar", "ForeName": "Anupam Das", "Initials": "AD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Comb Chem High Throughput Screen", "NlmUniqueID": "9810948", "ISSNLinking": "1386-2073"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "19"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35786332", "10.2174/1386207325666220701121537", "CCHTS-EPUB-124950"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
