E. Mullet, J. J. Burke, and C. J. Arntzen (1980) Plant Physiol. 65, 814-822] and further subjected to short-term solubilization with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), were resolved into four pigment-containing bands on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). We have identified these in order of increasing electrophoretic mobility as being (a) CPIa, (b) CPI, (c) the light-harvesting complex of photosystem I (LHC-I), and (d) a free pigment-zone. LHC-I had an absorption maximum in the red at 668-669 nm and a shoulder at 650 nm, which was resolved by its first-derivative spectrum to indicate the presence of chlorophyll b. LHC-I exhibited a 77 degrees K fluorescence emission maximum at 729-730 nm. The 77 degrees K fluorescence emission maxima of CPIa and CPI, excised from the gel, were at 729 and 722 nm, respectively. The LHC-I band, excised from the gel and rerun on dissociating SDS-PAGE, was resolved into two polypeptide doublets of 24-22.5 and 21-20.5 kDa. The CPIa band under similar conditions was resolved into polypeptides of 68, 24, 22.5, 21, 20.5, 19, 15, and 14 kDa; on the contrary, CPI contained only the 68-kDa polypeptide. When intact thylakoids were subjected to \"nondenaturing\" SDS-PAGE, LHC-I comigrated with an oligomeric form (dimer) of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b pigment-protein that preferentially serves photosystem II (LHCP-II). When this combined LHC-I/LHCP-II pigment-protein band was prepared by SDS-PAGE from isolated stroma lamellae, it exhibited a long-wavelength fluorescence band near 730 nm at 77 degrees K. When a similar preparation was obtained from sucrose density gradients containing SDS [J. Argyroudi-Akoyunoglou and H. Thomou (1981) FEBS Lett. 135, 171-181], it was found to be enriched in a 21-kDa polypeptide. The data suggest that the 21-kDa polypeptide of LHC-I is the chlorophyll-containing polypeptide responsible for the long-wavelength fluorescence of LHC-I; other polypeptides in the complex (20.5, 22.5, and 24 kDa) presumably bind chlorophyll and also serve an antennae function."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kuang", "ForeName": "T Y", "Initials": "TY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Argyroudi-Akoyunoglou", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nakatani", "ForeName": "H Y", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Watson", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Arntzen", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosystem I Protein Complex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosystem II Protein Complex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosystem I Protein Complex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosystem II Protein Complex"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6393881", "10.1016/0003-9861(84)90236-4", "0003-9861(84)90236-4"]}}]}
