Their unique bioactive composition and internal phenological environment contribute to the formation of specific and unique endophytic fungal communities, which are important resources for new compounds used in a variety of pharmacological activities. Nonetheless, they have not been systematically studied. In the last decade, nearly 64 genera and thousands of species of endophytic fungi have been discovered from leguminosae plants, as well as 138 secondary metabolites (with 34 new compounds) including flavonoid, alkaloids, phenol, anthraquinone, macrolide, terpenoid, phytohormone and many more. These were shown to have diverse applications and benefits, such as antibacterial, antitumor, antioxidative, immunoregulatory and neuroprotective properties. Here, we provide a summarized overview with the aim of raising awareness of endophytic fungi from medicinal leguminosae plants and providing a comprehensive review of the discoveries of new natural products that may be of medicinal and pharmaceutical importance."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.
