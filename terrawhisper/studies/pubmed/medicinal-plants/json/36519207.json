MGM treatment afforded renoprotective effects on rats with STZ-induced DN by alleviating systemic IR-induced renal inflammation and podocyte IR. These mechanisms were correlated mainly with the MGM treatment-induced inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/nuclear factor-kappa B axis and activation of the phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1(Tyr608)/phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/phosphorylated protein kinase B axis in the kidneys of DN rats. MGM had an ameliorative function in renal ferroptosis in rats with STZ-induced DN by upregulating mevalonate-mediated antioxidant capacities (glutathione peroxidase 4 and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1/coenzyme Q10 axis) and weakening acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4-mediated proferroptotic generation of lipid drivers in kidneys. MGM may be a promising alternative strategy for the treatment of DN."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Quality Control of Hebei Province, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Institute of Life Science and Green Development, Hebei University, 180 WuSi Road, Lianchi District, Baoding071002, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Chuanping", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Quality Control of Hebei Province, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Institute of Life Science and Green Development, Hebei University, 180 WuSi Road, Lianchi District, Baoding071002, China."}], "LastName": "Pu", "ForeName": "Zejiang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Quality Control of Hebei Province, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Institute of Life Science and Green Development, Hebei University, 180 WuSi Road, Lianchi District, Baoding071002, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Quality Control of Hebei Province, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Institute of Life Science and Green Development, Hebei University, 180 WuSi Road, Lianchi District, Baoding071002, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chang", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Monitoring and Analysis, Baoding Environmental Monitoring Center of Hebei Province, 224 Dongfeng Road, Lianchi District, Baoding071000, China."}], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "Jianzhong", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Monitoring and Analysis, Baoding Environmental Monitoring Center of Hebei Province, 224 Dongfeng Road, Lianchi District, Baoding071000, China."}], "LastName": "Lang", "ForeName": "Wenbo", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Core Facilities and Centers, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang050017, Hebei, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jinting", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3550-161X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang550014, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Chunmao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2215-3705"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Quality Control of Hebei Province, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Institute of Life Science and Green Development, Hebei University, 180 WuSi Road, Lianchi District, Baoding071002, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Chengyan", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1M84LD0UMD", "NameOfSubstance": "mangiferin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Nephropathies"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Podocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ferroptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Insulin Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Network Pharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multiomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36519207", "10.1021/acs.jafc.2c05595"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
