Samples of each food type, at each inoculation level, were analyzed simultaneously by both methods. A total of 19 laboratories representing federal government agencies and private industry in the United States and Canada participated. Food types were inoculated with Listeria species including L. monocytogenes, with the exception of 3 lots of green beans, which were naturally contaminated. During this study, 1764 samples and controls were analyzed and confirmed, of which 492 were positive and 947 were negative by both methods. There were 159 samples that were positive by culture method but negative by the EIA and 188 that were negative by culture method but positive by EIA. Twenty-two samples were negative by EIA and by culture method but confirmed positive when Assurance selective enrichment broths were subcultured to selective agar. The Assurance polyclonal EIA for detecting L. monocytogenes and related Listeria species in foods has been adopted first action by AOAC INTERNATIONAL."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BioControl Systems, Inc., Bothell, WA 98011, USA."}], "LastName": "Feldsine", "ForeName": "P T", "Initials": "PT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lienau", "ForeName": "A H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Forgey", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Calhoon", "ForeName": "R D", "Initials": "RD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Multicenter Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J AOAC Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9215446", "ISSNLinking": "1060-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Canada"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chi-Square Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dairy Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Decapoda"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guidelines as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoenzyme Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Listeria"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Listeria monocytogenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Meat Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Poultry Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sample Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Shellfish"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9241842"]}}]}
