The effects of these fibrous components on the digestibility of energy and nutrients were investigated. Although some rations had a similar nutrient composition, important differences in the digestibility of energy could be observed: e.g. soybean hulls and pea hulls had a similar content in crude fibre but differed in the digestibility of energy by a factor 1:2. The difference in the digestibility of energy was even more pronounced between the rations with soybean hulls and millet hulls (factor 1:11, respectively) although the crude fibre and ADF fibre content were similar. Therefore the magnitude of the difference in digestibility of energy shows a considerable variation between the fibre sources. This seems to be caused partially by differences in the chemical nature of the fibrous by-products. Soybean hulls and barley hulls proved to be very well suited for growing pigs (11.4 MJ DE/kg DM and 10.0 MJ DE/kg DM, respectively). The pea hulls showed a mean content of digestible energy (5.6 MJ DE/kg DM) whereas the millet hulls (1.1 MJ DE/kg DM) didn't contribute significantly to the energy supply of the pigs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Nutztierwissenschaften, Gruppe Ern\u00e4hrung, ETH Z\u00fcrich."}], "LastName": "Wenk", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Z\u00fcrcher", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Energetische Verwertung nahrungsfaserreicher Nebenprodukte aus der M\u00fcllerei- und Nahrungsmittelindustrie beim Schwein."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Arch Tierernahr", "NlmUniqueID": "0217641", "ISSNLinking": "0003-942X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hordeum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2173520", "10.1080/17450399009421073"]}}]}
