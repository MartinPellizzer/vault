Despite the various strategies to reduce mortality and improve quality of life, there are still many deficiencies in the diagnosis and treatment of gynecological cancers. One of the important steps to ensure optimal cancer treatment is the early detection of cancer cells and the use of drugs to reduce toxicity. Due to the increase in systemic toxicity and resistance to traditional and conventional diagnostic methods, new strategies, including nanotechnology, are being used to improve diagnosis and reduce the severity of the disease. Nanoparticles (NPs) provide exciting opportunities to improve Gynecological Cancers (GCs) diagnosis, particularly in the initial stages. In biomedical investigations and clinical settings, NPs can be used to increase the sensitivity and specificity of recognition and/or imaging of GCs with the help of their molecular and cellular processes. To design more efficient diagnostic NPs for gynecological cancer cells or tissues, determining the specific biomarkers is of great importance. NP-based imaging agents are another solution to trace cancer cells. This review highlights the potential of some NP-based diagnostic techniques in GC detection, which could be translated to clinical settings to improve patient care."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Genetics Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic Syndrome Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Keyvani", "ForeName": "Vahideh", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Mashhad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Riahi", "ForeName": "Espanta", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic Syndrome Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahmoudian", "ForeName": "Reihaneh Alsadat", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Anvari", "ForeName": "Kazem", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic Syndrome Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Biomedical Sciences, Queensland University of Technology [QUT], Brisbane 4059, Australia."}], "LastName": "Avan", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39021196", "10.2174/0113816128317605240628063731", "CPD-EPUB-141706"]}}]}
