Nevertheless, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of molecular interactions and motion mechanism has greatly hindered the development of novel inhibitors against hCNT3. In this paper, molecular recognition of hCNT3 with uridine was investigated with molecular docking, conventional molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations and adaptive steered molecular dynamics (ASMD) simulations; and then, the uridine derivatives with possibly highly inhibitory activity were designed. The result of CMD showed that more water-mediated H-bonds and lower binding free energy both explained higher recognition ability and transported efficiency of hCNT3. While during the ASMD simulation, nucleoside transport process involved the significant side-chain flip of residues F321 and Q142, a typical substrate-induced conformational change. By considering electronegativity, atomic radius, functional group and key H-bonds factors, 25 novel uridine derivatives were constructed. Subsequently, the receptor-ligand binding free energy was predicted by solvated interaction energy (SIE) method to determine the inhibitor c8 with the best potential performance. This work not only revealed molecular recognition and release mechanism of uridine with hCNT3, but also designed a series of uridine derivatives to obtain lead compounds with potential high activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
