Characteristic smell is the typical feature of it. As per the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India and many other classical texts, rhizomes of <i>Valeriana jatamansi</i> of the family <i>Valerianceae</i> is the accepted source of the drug. From some of the reports from early 1980s, it was found that roots of some aquatic plants such as <i>Nymphoides macrospermum, Nymphoides hydrophylla, Nymphoides indica</i>, and <i>Limnanthemum cristatum</i> were said to be used as <i>Tagara</i> instead of <i>V. jatamansi</i> in the South Indian markets.", "This study proposed to assess the present status of <i>Tagara</i> available in herbal raw drug markets of Kerala.", "Five market samples of <i>Tagara</i> were collected from selected markets of Kerala, and some of the reported aquatic plants, collected from natural habitats nearby. Macroscopic, microscopic, histochemical, and powder microscopic characterization of all these samples were done as per the standard procedure mentioned in Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India and characters observed were compared with official source plant and pharmacopoeial standard.", "Morphological characters of market samples of <i>Tagara</i> collected from the various markets of Kerala were not matching with the rhizomes of genuine drug <i>V. jatamansi</i> and that of Uttarakhand sample. The microscopic and histochemical examination also gave the same result. However, these samples showed similarities with the roots of <i>Nymphoides macrospermam</i>. Sample collected from Uttarakhand was the rhizome of <i>V. jatamansi</i>.", "The collected market samples of <i>Tagara</i> from various Kerala markets were not the rhizomes of <i>V. jatamansi</i> but the roots of <i>N. macrospermam</i>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2024 AYU (An International Quarterly Journal of Research in Ayurveda)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PG Diploma Scholar, Department of Dravyaguna Vijnana, VPSV Ayurveda College, Kottakkal, Malappuram, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Iqbal", "ForeName": "P Mohammed", "Initials": "PM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy Division, Centre for Medicinal Plant Research, Arya Vaidya Sala, Kottakkal, Malappuram, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Harinarayanan", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Professor Department of Dravyaguna Vijnana, VPSV Ayurveda College, Kottakkal, Malappuram, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Palengara", "ForeName": "Vivek", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Ayu", "NlmUniqueID": "7605807", "ISSNLinking": "0974-8520"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "National Medicinal Plants Board.
