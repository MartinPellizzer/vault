AS (10(-6) g/l) prolonged the action potential duration whereas the associated contraction was depressed. This is not due to the blocking action of AS on the tubular sodium current since similar results were obtained in the presence of high tetrodotoxin (TTX) concentrations. This is not due to some blocking action of AS on the L-type calcium current since this type of calcium current was enhanced by the extract. In contrast, the cardiac T-type calcium current was decreased by 10(-6) g/l AS. AS exerted a dose-dependent (tested for concentrations ranging from 5 x 10(-10) to 5 x 10(-5) g/l) inhibition of the two components of the contractile response elicited by durable depolarizations, with a prominent effect on the tonic phase. This effect was partially relieved by increasing the external divalent cation (Ca2+ or Cd2+) concentration. At the same concentration it shifted the inactivation/potential relationship for tension by 20 mV towards negative potentials. It is concluded that the inhibitory action of AS on excitation-contraction coupling is partly or completely due to the enhancement of the voltage- and Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation processes of the voltage-sensor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, University of Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Ewane-Nyambi", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bois", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Raymond", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cations, Divalent"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Action Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Channels"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cations, Divalent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscles"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rana ridibunda"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sarcolemma"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8386788", "10.1016/0378-8741(93)90079-k", "0378-8741(93)90079-K"]}}]}
