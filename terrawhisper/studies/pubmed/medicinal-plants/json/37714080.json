The in vitro studies indicated the abilities of the synthesized derivatives to inhibit VEGFR-2 and prevent the growth of two different cancer cell types, HepG2 and MCF-7. Compound 11\u00a0f exhibited the strongest anti-VEGFR-2 activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.053\u00a0\u00b5M). As well, compound 11\u00a0f showed impressive anti-proliferative activity against the mentioned cancer cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 and 0.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively. Additionally, compound 11\u00a0f arrested the MCF-7 cell cycle at the S phase and increased the overall apoptosis percentage. Furthermore, cell migration assay revealed that compound 11\u00a0f has a significant ability to prevent migration and healing potentialities of MCF-7. Moreover, computational studies were used to conduct the molecular investigation of the VEGFR-2-11\u00a0f complex. The kinetic and structural features of the complex were examined using molecular dynamics simulations and molecular docking. Besides, Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to explain the dynamics of the VEGFR-2-11\u00a0f complex at various spatial scales. The DFT calculations also provided further clarity regarding compound 11\u00a0f's structural and electronic features. To evaluate how closely the developed compounds might look like drugs, ADMET and toxicity experiments were computed. To conclude, the presented study demonstrates the potential of compound 11\u00a0f as a viable anti-cancer drug, which can serve as a prototype for future structural modifications and further biological investigations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
