This exposure results in considerable ROS generation leading to oxidative stress, the primary response of the plants under heavy metal stress. Withania somnifera is a reputed Indian medicinal plant in Ayurveda, having various pharmacological activities due to the presence of withanolides. The present study deals with the understanding endurance of oxidative stress caused by heavy metal exposure and its management through antioxidant partners in synchronization with secondary metabolites in W. somnifera. The quantitative assessment of enzymatic/non-enzymatic antioxidants revealed significant participation of ascorbate-glutathione-\u03b1-tocopherol triad in ROS management. Higher activities of glutathione reductase (GR), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) resulted in glutathione and ascorbate accumulation. In addition, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and peroxidase (POD) were contributed considerably in ROS homeostasis maintenance. In-situ localization and assays related to ROS generation/scavenging revealed key management of ROS status under Cd stress. Higher antioxidative and reducing power activity attributed to the tolerance capability to the plant. Increased expression of withanolide biosynthetic pathway genes such as WsHMGR, WsDXS, WsDXR and WsCAS correlated with enhanced withanolides. The present study indicated the crucial role of the ascorbate-glutathione-\u03b1-tocopherol triad in co-ordination with withanolide biosynthesis in affording the oxidative stress, possibly through a cross-talk between the antioxidant machinery and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The knowledge may be useful in providing the guidelines for developing abiotic stress resistance in plants using conventional and molecular approaches."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.
