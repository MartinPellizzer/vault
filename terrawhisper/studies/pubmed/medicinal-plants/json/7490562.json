We have previously found that glucose and insulin concentrations are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of rams in which the secretion of gonadotrophins has been stimulated by a nutritional supplement of lupin grain (Lupinus angustifolius). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that insulin and/or glucose is a metabolic modulator of GnRH secretion and mediates the effects of nutrition on gonadotrophin secretion. Six mature rams were fed a diet that maintained live weight and then given a series of infusions, each for 12 h/day for 4 days, in a cross-over design. The treatments were: artificial CSF (aCSF), glucose (50 mumol/h) in aCSF, insulin (0.6 ng/h) in aCSF, and glucose (50 mumol/h) plus insulin (0.6 ng/h) in aCSF; all infused at a rate of 5 microliters/min. At the same time as the infusion treatments, two other groups of four rams without cerebral cannulae were fed either the maintenance diet or the same diet supplemented with 750 g lupin grain per head per day for 4 days, again in a cross-over design. Rams fed the lupin supplement showed an increase in both LH pulse frequency and mean FSH on day 4 (P < 0.05). Infusion of aCSF or glucose did not affect gonadotrophin secretion. Rams infused with insulin or insulin plus glucose showed an increase (P < 0.05) in LH pulse frequency but no increase in FSH concentrations on day 4 of infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Agriculture, Animal Science, University of Western Australia, Nedlands."}], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "D W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Blache", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Martin", "ForeName": "G B", "Initials": "GB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Endocrinol", "NlmUniqueID": "0375363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0795"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-67-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Luteinizing Hormone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-68-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Follicle Stimulating Hormone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Follicle Stimulating Hormone"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "cerebrospinal fluid"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "cerebrospinal fluid"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Luteinizing Hormone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7490562", "10.1677/joe.0.1470321"]}}]}
