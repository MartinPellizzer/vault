A total of 49\u00a0plants with reported ethnobotanical uses, such as the healing of wounds and burns, treatment of skin-related diseases, rheumatism, arthritis, and bone diseases, were initially chosen as potential candidates. The <i>in vitro</i> collagenase inhibitory activity of hydroalcoholic extracts of these plants was tested. Moreover, their phytochemical profiles were analyzed by <sup>1</sup>H NMR and combined with the inhibitory activity data by an orthogonal partial least squares model. The results showed a correlation between the bioactivity and the concentration of phenolics, including flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, and tannins, in the extracts. Considering the eventual false-positive effect on the bioactivity given by tannins, a tannin removal procedure was performed on the most active extracts. After this procedure, <i>Alchemilla vulgaris</i> was the most persistently active, proving to owe its activity to compounds other than tannins. Thus, this plant was selected as the most promising and further investigated through bioassay-guided fractionation, which resulted in the isolation of a flavonoid, quercetin-3-<i>O</i>-<i>\u03b2</i>-glucuronide, as confirmed by NMR and HRMS spectra. This compound showed not only a higher activity than other flavonoids with the same aglycone moiety, but was also higher than doxycycline (positive control), the only Federal Drug Administration-approved collagenase inhibitor. The approach employed in this study, namely the integration of metabolomics and bioactivity-guided fractionation, showed great potential as a tool for plant selection and identification of bioactive compounds in natural product research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biology, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy."}], "LastName": "Mandrone", "ForeName": "Manuela", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biology, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands."}], "LastName": "Coqueiro", "ForeName": "Aline", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy."}], "LastName": "Poli", "ForeName": "Ferruccio", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Life Quality Studies, University of Bologna, Rimini, Italy."}], "LastName": "Antognoni", "ForeName": "Fabiana", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biology, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Young Hae", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "quercetin 3-O-glucuronide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagenases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alchemilla"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Collagenases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29797306", "10.1055/a-0630-2079"]}}]}
