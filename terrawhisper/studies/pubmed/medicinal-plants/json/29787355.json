We assessed the effectiveness of Lavender cream and footbath on sleep quality and fatigue in pregnancy and postpartum. In this trial, 141 women with sleep disturbance at 25-28\u00a0weeks gestation were recruited from public health centers in Tabriz, Iran, from May 2013 until January 2014 and randomized into one of three groups receiving: Lavender and footbath, Lavender alone, or placebo cream. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index at the 4th and 8th weeks after intervention and the 6th week postpartum. Fatigue was assessed with the multidimensional assessment of fatigue scale at the 6th week after intervention and the 6th week postpartum. Repeated measures ANOVA and ANCOVA were used. Compared with the placebo group, the global sleep quality score post-intervention in pregnancy and the postpartum were significantly lower in the Lavender and footbath and the Lavender cream only groups. Fatigue in both intervention groups was significantly improved only at the 6th week postpartum. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two intervention groups. Lavender cream with or without footbath may improve sleep quality in pregnancy and postpartum."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Midwifery, Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery , Urmia University of Medical Sciences , Urmia , Iran."}], "LastName": "Effati-Daryani", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4785-9333"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Department of Midwifery, Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery , Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammad-Alizadeh-Charandabi", "ForeName": "Sakineh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Department of Midwifery, Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery , Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirghafourvand", "ForeName": "Mojgan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Research Center for Biochemistry & Nutrition in Metabolic Disease , Kashan University of Medical Sciences , Kashan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Taghizadeh", "ForeName": "Mohsen", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Development and Coordination of Scientific Texts , Barij Medicinal Plants Research Center , Kashan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Bekhradi", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Hazrate Zahra Hospital , Qom University of Medical Sciences , Qom , Iran."}], "LastName": "Zarei", "ForeName": "Somayeh", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Women Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7608076", "ISSNLinking": "0363-0242"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Fatigue"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lavandula"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Mothers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Postpartum Period"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin Cream"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep Wake Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29787355", "10.1080/03630242.2017.1414101"]}}]}
