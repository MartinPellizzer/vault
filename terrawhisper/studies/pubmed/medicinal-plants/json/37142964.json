This species is considered as an important resource plant because it can produce Taxol which is an effective medicinal compound against various cancers (Zhang et al., 2010). Stem blight was observed in two plant nurseries in Ya'an (102\u00b044'E,30\u00b042'N), Sichuan province in April 2021. The symptoms first appeared as round brown spots on the stem. As the disease progressed, the damaged area gradually expanded into an oval or irregular shape, which was dark brown. About 800 square meters of planting area were investigated and the disease incidence was up to approximately 64.8%. Twenty obviously symptomatic stems which exhibited the same symptoms as above were collected from 5 different trees in the nursery. To isolate the pathogen, the symptom margin was cut into small blocks (5 x 5 mm), and the blocks were surface sterilized in 75% ethanol for 90 s and 3% NaClO solution for 60 s . Finally incubated on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) at 28\u2103 for 5 days. Ten pure cultures were isolated by transferring hyphal and the three strains (HDS06, HDS07 and HDS08) were selected as representative isolates for further study. Initially, colonies on the PDA of three isolates were white and cotton-like, and then gradually turned gray-black from the center. After 21 days, conidia were produced and were smooth-walled, single-celled, black, oblate, or spherical, measuring 9.3 to 13.6 \u00d7 10.1 to 14.5 \u03bcm in size (n = 50). Conidia were present at the tip of conidiophores on hyaline vesicles. These morphological features were generally consistent with those of N. musae (Wang et al., 2017). To validate the identification, DNA were extracted from the three isolates, followed by the amplification of transcribed spacer region of rDNA (ITS), the translation elongation factor EF-1 (TEF-1), and the Beta-tubulin (TUB2) sequences with the respective primer pairs ITS1/ITS4 (White et al., 1990), EF-728F/EF-986R (Vieira et al., 2014) and Bt2a/Bt2b (O'Donnell et al., 1997) .The sequences were deposited in GenBank with the accession numbers ON965533, OP028064, OP028068, OP060349, OP060353, OP060354, OP060350, OP060351 and OP060352, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of combined ITS, TUB2, and TEF genes using the Mrbayes inference method showed that the three isolates clustered with Nigrospora musae as a distinct clade (Fig. 2). Combine with morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analysis, three isolates were identified as N. musae. 30 2-year-old healthy potted plants of T. chinensis were used for pathogenicity test. 25 of these plants were inoculated by injecting 10 \u03bcL of the conidia suspension (1 \u00d7 106 conidia/mL) into stems and then wrap around the seal to moisturize. The remaining 5 plants were injected with the same amount of sterilized distilled water as a control. Finally, all potted plants were placed in a greenhouse at 25\u00b0C and 80% relative humidity. After 2 weeks, the inoculated stems developed lesions similar to those observed in the field, whereas controls were asymptomatic. N. musae was re-isolated from the infected stem and identified by both morphological characteristics and DNA sequence analysis. The experiments repeated three times showed similar results. As far as we know, this is the first report of N. musae causing T. chinensis stem blight in the world. The identification of N. musae could provide a certain theoretical basis for field management and further research of T. chinensis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University - Chengdu Campus, 506176, College of Forestry, Huimin Road, ChengDu, SiChuan, China, 610031; cxy200178@163.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xingyu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University - Chengdu Campus, 506176, College of Forestry, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China, xuxiu0910; 2056317155@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xiu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University - Chengdu Campus, 506176, College of Forestry, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 1625813937@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University - Chengdu Campus, 506176, College of Forestry, No. 211, Sichuan Agricultural University, Gongping Street, Chengdu, Sichuan, China, 611100; ltt666888999@163.com."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Tingting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University - Chengdu Campus, 506176, College of Forestry, ChengDu, SiChuan, China; 2483654639@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University - Chengdu Campus, 506176, No. 211, Huimin Road,, Wenjiang District, Chengdu, China, 611130; zhuth1227@126.com."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Tianhui", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "No. 211, Huimin Road, Wenjiang DistrictChengdu, Sichuan, China, 611130; 14087@sicau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shujiang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "chengdu, China; lyg927@263.net."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yinggao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University, 12529, College of Forestry, Huimin road 211, Chengdu, China, 611130; tlinsau@163.com."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Tiantian", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu, China; 525636693@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Qiao", "ForeName": "Tianmin", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural UniversityChengdu, Sichuan, China, 611130; yangcl0121@163.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chunlin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University, 12529, College of Forestry, No. 211, Huimin Road,, Wenjiang District, Chengdu, Sichuan, China, 611130."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United States; lishuying127@163.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shuying", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University College of Forestry, 563013, College of Forestry, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 201905912@stu.sicau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Liling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University - Chengdu Campus, 506176, College of Forestry, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 1147723104@QQ.COM."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Jiaxin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Agricultural University, College of Forestry, No. 211 Huimin Road, Chengdu, United States, 611130."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "No. 211 Huimin RoadChengdu, 611130; hanshan6618@163.com."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "37"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37142964", "10.1094/PDIS-08-22-1892-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
