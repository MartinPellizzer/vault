Juss.) has universally been accepted as a wonder tree because of its diverse utility. Multidirectional therapeutic uses of neem have been known in India since the Vedic times. Besides its therapeutic efficacies, neem has already established its potential as a source of naturally occurring insecticide, pesticide and agrochemicals. Safe and economically cheaper uses of different parts of neem in the treatment of various diseases and in agriculture are discussed in this article. It further deals with the active chemical constituents of various neem formulations. Commercially available neem products are also mentioned along with their respective applications. Furthermore, evaluation of safety aspects of different parts of neem and neem compounds along with commercial formulations are also taken into consideration. Systematic scientific knowledge on neem reported so far is thus very useful for the wider interests of the world community."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Product Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan 731235, West Bengal, India. brahmg2001@yahoo.co.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brahmachari", "ForeName": "Goutam", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Chembiochem", "NlmUniqueID": "100937360", "ISSNLinking": "1439-4227"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Agrochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiparasitic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Agrochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiparasitic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Azadirachta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "154"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15185362", "10.1002/cbic.200300749"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
