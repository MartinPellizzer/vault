The static capacity absorption, static elution ratios of five types of resin were studied respectively, and were compared to evaluate their absorption and desorption effect to PML. And then the absorption capacity, elution solution and elution volume of the AB-8 resin were researched to set up the optimum separation process for PML. Finally, PML was recrysallized from MeOH and identified by spectra analysis.", "The AB-8 resin had the best absorptive and separative properties to PML. The dynamic absorption ratio was 2.44 mg/g. The applicable process was as follows: the water extracted solution of Nauclea officinalis flow through the resin column repeatedly, after being eluted with 6BV of distilled water, the resin column was eluted with 4BV 30% ethanol, the 30% ethanol fraction was combined and the solvent was recovered in vacuum. The precipitation was filtered and recrysallized from MeOH to give pure PML. The yield of PML was 75.1%, and the product purity was up to 99.5%.", "AB-8 resin shows better comprehensive absorption property. It can be used for separation and purification of PML from Nauclea officinalis successfully."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Pharmaceutics, 411th Hospital of PLA, Shanghai 200434, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xuan", "ForeName": "Wei-dong", "Initials": "WD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bian", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hai-sheng", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Resins, Synthetic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "pumiloside"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XT3Z54Z28A", "NameOfSubstance": "Camptothecin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Camptothecin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Resins, Synthetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rubiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Technology, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18300508"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
