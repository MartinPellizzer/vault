Marsdenia tenacissima (M.t), a Chinese medicinal plant has been extensively used as clinical remedy for treating several types of cancer. In this present study, ZnONPs were synthesized from Marsdenia tenacissima and its anti cancer potency was assessed against in vitro laryngeal cancer cell line Hep-2. The biosynthesized Marsdenia tenacissima Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles [M.t-ZnONPs] was characterized using UV-visible Spec, SEM, TEM and EDAX analysis. The cytotoxic and apoptotic inducing potential of M.t-ZnONPs was assessed by MTT assay and staining such as DCFH-DA, AO/EtBr, Rhodamine 123, DAPI and comet assay. The anticancer potential of M.t-ZnONPs was analysed by Real time PCR analysis of proapoptotic, antiapoptotic and caspases proteins. Our present findings showed characteristic and morphological representation of synthesized M.t-ZnONPs by UV-visible Spec, SEM, TEM and EDAX analysis. M.t-ZnONPs exhibits its cytotoxicity by inhibiting the viability of Hep-2 cells and IC<sub>50</sub> value was obtained by MTT assay. The results of apoptotic staining techniques in M.t-ZnONPs treated Hep-2 cells confirm with excess ROS generation, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and nuclear damage. The apoptotic inducing potential of M.t-ZnONPs was also evidenced by upregulation of proapoptotic proteins Bax, Caspase 3 & 9 and downregultion of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 by RT-PCR analysis. Finally, these results suggested that biosynthesized M.t-ZnONPs is an effective anticancer agent which induces apoptosis in Hep-2 laryngeal cell line and thus conclude that M.t-ZnONPs, a valid anticancer strategy in treating various cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
