Although the protective effect of pre-treatment by Gastrodin (Gst) on a PD model has been evaluated, in the current experimental study, we investigated the symptomatic therapeutic effects of Gst microinjection in the same PD model but in the post-parkinsonism induction condition.", "Parkinsonism was induced by unilateral infusion of 6- hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; 8\u00a0\u03bcg/ 2\u00a0\u03bcl/ rat) into the central region of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). After the recovery period and confirmation of parkinsonism, daily Gst treatment in three doses (20, 40, 80\u00a0\u00b5g/ 2 \u00b5/ rat, continued for ten days with motor monitoring by bar test and rotarod examinations. Moreover, lipid peroxidation and myeloperoxidase activity were evaluated.", "In this model of 6-OHDA-induced parkinsonism, Gst treatment in all three doses showed a dose dependent symptomatic improvement in motor imbalance (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001) catalepsy (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001), decreased lipid peroxidation (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001) and SNc myeloperoxidase activity (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001).", "6-OHDA induced parkinsonism symptomatically improved behaviorally with Gst post-induction treatment along with decreased markers of oxidative stress and microglial activation.
