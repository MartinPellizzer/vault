The rise in diabetes mellitus coupled with the lack of an effective treatment has led many to investigate medicinal plants to identify a viable alternative.", "To evaluate red blood cell (RBC) membrane adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activities and antioxidant levels in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats administered aqueous preparation of Kalanchoe pinnata leaves.", "Diabetes mellitus was induced in rats by a single administration of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). Diabetic rats were then treated with aqueous K. pinnata preparation (three mature leaves ~ 9.96 g/70 kg body weight or about 0.14 g/kg body weight/day) for 30 days. Serum glucose, RBC membrane ATPase activities, and antioxidant levels were determined.", "We noted weight loss and reduced food consumption in the treated diabetic group. Serum glucose levels were reduced in the treated diabetic group compared to the other groups. Superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione levels were not significantly elevated in the treated group compared to the diabetic group. However, serum catalase activity was significantly (P < 0.05) increased in the treated diabetic group compared to the other groups. Serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were not significantly altered among the groups. There was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in Mg(2+) ATPase activity and a nonsignificant increase in Na(+)/K(+) ATPase activity in the RBC membrane of the treated diabetic group compared to the diabetic group.", "The consumption of aqueous preparation of K. pinnata may accrue benefits in the management of diabetes by lowering oxidative stress often associated with the disease and improving the availability of cellular magnesium through an increase in the magnesium ATPase pump in the RBC membrane for increased cellular metabolism of glucose through the glycolytic pathway.", "We noted weight loss and reduced food consumption in the diabetic rats treated with K. pinnata preparationSerum glucose levels were reduced in diabetic rats treated with K. pinnata preparationSerum catalase activity was significantly (P < 0.05) increased in diabetic rats treated with K. pinnata preparationWe also noted a significant (P < 0.05) increase in Mg(2+) ATPase activity in the RBC membranes of diabetic rats treated with K. pinnata preparationOverall, the consumption of aqueous preparation of K. pinnata lowered oxidative stress often associated with diabetes and improved availability of cellular magnesium through an increase in magnesium ATPase pump in the RBC membrane."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences, Texas A&M University, Corpus Christi, Texas, USA."}], "LastName": "Menon", "ForeName": "Nikhil", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences, Texas A&M University, Corpus Christi, Texas, USA."}], "LastName": "Sparks", "ForeName": "Jean", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences, Texas A&M University, Corpus Christi, Texas, USA."}], "LastName": "Omoruyi", "ForeName": "Felix O", "Initials": "FO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacognosy Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101558769", "ISSNLinking": "0974-8490"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Aguiree F, Brown A, Cho N, Dahlquist G.
