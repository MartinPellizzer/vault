The blood glucose concentration was measured by glucose oxidase method. The serum insulin level was determined by 125I-insulin radioimmunoassay kit. The hypoglycemic effect was evaluated by the levels of both fasting and no-fasting blood glucose. The effect on serum insulin level was estimated by the values of the blood insulin and the changes of the blood glucose induced by the glucose intraperitoneal injection. The effect on the glucose absorption was investigated by the oral sucrose or starch tolerance test.", "Both of the fasting and no-fasting blood glucose levels were decreased significantly by the treatment of 20 or 30 g raw materials crude drug x kg (-1) SHG orally for 7-10 d in ICR mice or in alloxan diabetic mice. In the oral sucrose tolerance test or oral starch tolerance test, the administration of SHG reduced significantly the peak value of the blood glucose and the area under the blood glucose-time curve (AUC) in normal or alloxan diabetic mice, respectively. These effects of SHG were similar to those of acarbose, a kind of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. In the oral glucose tolerance test in normal and alloxan diabetic mice, SHG decreased both the blood glucose peak and the AUC induced by the glucose loading. But in the intraperitoneal injection glucose tolerance test the levels of insulin in both SHG and control mice were similar, however, the changes of the blood glucose level after the glucose-loading for 30 min in SHG mice was much lower than that in control mice.", "With the treatment of SHG, the fasting and no-fasting blood glucose concentrations were decreased and the glucose tolerance improved significantly in both normal and alloxan diabetic mice, and the inhibition of a-glucosidase might be one of its major mechanisms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Jin-ying", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Teng-fei", "Initials": "TF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Ya-lun", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cong", "ForeName": "Wei-na", "Initials": "WN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zi-liang", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SW5YHA5NG", "NameOfSubstance": "Alloxan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.20", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Glucosidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alloxan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Area Under Curve"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucose Tolerance Test"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intraperitoneal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Glucosidases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17802886"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
