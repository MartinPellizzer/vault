Syringin extracted from various medicinal plants has been used extensively for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Hence, this study was conducted to further explore the protective effects of the syringin in ovalbumin (OVA) induced-asthma mice model. OVA-sensitized BALB mice were treated intraperitonealy with three doses (25, 50 and 100\u2009mg/kg) of the syringin which was validated by the alteration in the immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, cytokines levels, histopathological evaluation inflammatory cell count, lung weight, nitrite (NO) levels, oxidative stress biomarkers and gene markers. The treatment of syringin intensely reduced the increased IgE, inflammatory cytokines, WBC count and restored the antioxidant stress markers OVA stimulated animals. In addition, a significant reduction in inflammation and mucus production was evidenced in histopathological analysis which was further validated by suppression NF-\u03baB pathway activation by syringin. These results suggest that syringin may improve asthma symptoms in OVA-induced mice by modulating NF-\u03baB pathway activation."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Manman", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ningling", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1558-2712"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "100885357", "ISSNLinking": "1520-4081"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylpropionates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9006-59-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Ovalbumin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I6F5B11C96", "NameOfSubstance": "syringin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ovalbumin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylpropionates"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pneumonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Mattiuzzi C, Lippi G.
