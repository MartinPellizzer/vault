Matsum. & Koidz.) has been used for medicinal purposes and a leafy vegetable in South Korea (Choi et al., 2007; Debnath et al., 2017). In May 2022, brown spots and blight were observed on the leaves in a farmer's field in Namwon (35\u00b026'58.9\"N, 127\u00b028'55.9\"E), Korea. About 80% of the plants in a 3000 m2 cultivation area were infected. To isolate the causal agent, small pieces (1 mm<sup>2</sup>) surface-sterilized (1% NaOCl for 1 min) symptomatic leaf tissues were put onto a water agar (WA) plate and incubated in the dark at 25\u2103. After five days of incubation, two isolates (FD00021, FD00022) were obtained from diseased leaves using a single spore isolation technique. Morphological characteristics were examined after seven days of incubation at 25\u2103 in the dark. Colonies were 51.6 to 65.3 mm in diameter, gray-green in the center, and ivory at the edge. Conidiophores were straight or curved and 10 - 34 \u00d7 4 - 5 \u03bcm. Conidia were solitary or two to four in a chain, long ellipsoid to obclavate, one to thirteen transverse septa, 52 - 169 \u00d714 - 34 \u03bcm, blunt-tapered beak variable in size 4 - 56 \u00d7 3 - 10 \u03bcm (n=75). The morphological and cultural characteristics of the isolates were consistent with that of <i>Alternaria cinerariae</i> (Nishikawa and Nakashima, 2015; Simmons, 2007). For molecular identification, genomic DNA was extracted from 5-day-old cultures using the Maxwell<sup>\u00ae</sup> RSC PureFood GMO and Authentication Kit (Promega). Five gene regions, including rDNA ITS, GPD, Alt a, RPB2, and EF1-\u03b1 were amplified and sequenced using ITS1/ITS4, gpd1/gpd2, Alt-a1-for/ Alt-a1-rev, RPB2-5F2/RPB2-7cR, and EF1-728F/EF1-986R primer sets respectively (Wang et al., 2022; Garibaldi et al., 2022). The resulting sequences were deposited in GenBank with accession no. OP785152, OP785153 and OP832000 to OP832007). The concatenated genes (rDNA ITS, GPD, Alt a, RPB2, and EF1-\u03b1) sequence identity of the FD00021 and FD00022 against the reference strain A. cinerariae CBS 116495 is 99.92% (2572/2574) and 99.84% (2570/2574), respectively. Maximum Likelihood tree was inferred based on the concatenated sequences of the five gene regions using the Kimura 2-parameter model with 1,000 bootstrap replications. The phylogenetic tree showed that the present strains and <i>A. cinerariae</i> CBS 116495 fell into the same clade with high bootstrap support (100%). Based on morphological characteristics and molecular analysis, the isolates were identified as A. cinerariae. To confirm their pathogenicity, drops (70 \u03bcl) of conidial suspension (1\u00d710<sup>4</sup> spores/ml) were applied on intact healthy leaves (3 leaves/plant) of plants (3 plants/isolate) that had been cultivated for one month after transplantation as seedlings. Controls were treated with sterile distilled water. The treated plants were covered with plastic boxes to maintain humidity around 90% and were maintained in an incubator at 25\u2103 in a 12-hour light-dark cycle. Symptoms appeared only on inoculated leaves after four days of inoculation, while controls remained asymptomatic. The <i>A. cinerariae</i> isolates were re-isolated from infected tissue of the inoculated leaves, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. <i>Alternaria cinerariae</i> is an important plant pathogen that can cause leaf spot and blight on a variety of host plants including <i>Cineraria</i> spp. and <i>Tussilago farfara</i> (He et al. 2020). This is the first report on leaf spot on Narrow-head ragwort caused by <i>A. cinerariae</i> in the world. Leaf spot disease caused by <i>Alternaria cinerariae</i> is a significant threat to narrow-head ragwort agriculture in South Korea. Therefore, its control strategies are necessary for increasing productivity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Agricultural Sciences, 230986, crop life safety, 166 Nongsaengmyeong-ro, Iseo-myeon, Suwon, Korea (the Republic of), 55365; hyunjoor@korea.kr."}], "LastName": "Ryu", "ForeName": "Hyunjoo", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Crop Protection, 166, Nongsaengmyeong-ro, Iseo-myeon, Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do, Korea (the Republic of), 55365; sukihong@korea.kr."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Sung Kee", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Rural Development Administration, 54670, Department of Agricultural Product Safety, 166, Nongsaengmyeong-ro, Jeonju, Korea (the Republic of), 54875."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kyungpook National University, 34986, Department of Ecology & Environme, 2559 Gyungsangdae-ro, Daegu, Korea (the Republic of), 41566; nobinpstu@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "Oliul", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Crop Protection, Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do, Korea (the Republic of)."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jeonbuk National University, 26714, Jeonju, Jeollabuk-do, Korea (the Republic of); naho1348@naver.com."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hobhin", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Academy of Agricultural Science, Crop Protection Division, National Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Rural Development Administration, Wanju 55365, Korea, Wanju, Korea (the Republic of), 55365; hyon338@korea.kr."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Hyo-Won", "Initials": "HW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "18"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "18"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "57"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38170443", "10.1094/PDIS-04-23-0744-PDN"]}}]}
