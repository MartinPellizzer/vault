Here, we compared the proliferation and multipotency of subcutaneous ASCs (SC-ASCs) and epididymal ASCs (ED-ASCs) before and after induction of diabetes by streptozotocin. <b>Methods:</b> The adipogenic and osteogenic abilities of rat SC-ASCs and ED-ASCs were evaluated using Oil Red O and Alizarin Red staining, respectively. The expression of adipocyte (PPAR-\u03b3, LPL) and osteoblast (ALP, SPP1) specific mRNAs was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR. MTT test was used for determination of cell proliferation capacity. <b>Results:</b> The proliferation of SC-ASCs was higher than ED-ASCs, both before and after diabetes induction (P<0.05). Diabetes increased the proliferative capability of SC-ASCs (P<0.05) but not ED-ASCs. Before diabetes, both adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of SC-ASCs were higher than ED-ASCs (P<0.05). After diabetes, both SC-ASCs and ED-ASCs were able to differentiate into adipocyte and osteoblast, but the levels of differentiation were higher in SC-ASCs than in ED-ASCs (P<0.05). Diabetes decreased the expression of PPAR-\u03b3 and LPL, but increased the SPP1 and ALP expression in both SC-ASCs and ED-ASCs. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our data suggested that diabetes increases the proliferation of ASCs but decreases their adipogenic differentiation. Also, SC-ASCs have higher proliferation and differentiation abilities than ED-ASCs in normal and diabetic conditions so can be more preferable for cell therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mojarrad", "ForeName": "Majid", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hatami", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hoseini", "ForeName": "Seyed Javad", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghazavi", "ForeName": "Hamed", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Azar", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes", "NlmUniqueID": "9505926", "ISSNLinking": "0947-7349"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "PPAR gamma"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Spp1 protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "106441-73-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Osteopontin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.34", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoprotein Lipase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaline Phosphatase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaline Phosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Intra-Abdominal Fat"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoprotein Lipase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mesenchymal Stem Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Osteopontin"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "PPAR gamma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Subcutaneous Fat"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27657995", "10.1055/s-0042-113460"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
