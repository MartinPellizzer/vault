Monoamine oxidase B was immobilized onto the surface of the microchannel for the first time to specifically extract its ligands when the plant's extracts solution flows through the channel. The thermal and the storage stability of immobilized monoamine oxidase B were significantly enhanced after immobilization. Crocin I and \u2161 were extracted from Crocus sativus, and tiliroside was extracted from Edgeworthia gardneri. All the three compounds were inhibitors of the enzyme with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of 26.70\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.91, 19.88\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.78, and 15.65 \u00b1 0.85\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. The enzyme inhibition kinetics and molecular docking were investigated. This is the first report on the inhibitory effects of tiliroside and crocin \u2161. The novel ligand fishing method proposed in this work possesses advantages of rapidness, high efficiency, and tiny sample consumption compared to routine ligand fishing, with promising potential for screening active natural products in complex mixtures."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, P.
