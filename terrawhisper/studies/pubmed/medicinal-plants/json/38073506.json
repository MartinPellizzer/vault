The aim was to investigate the antioxidant properties and carotenoid composition of aqueous extracts of <i>Mentha piperita</i> or <i>Artemisia vulgaris</i> which were previously found to exert beneficial effects on human health through diet. aqueous extracts exhibited potent antioxidant activity. A diversity of carotenoids was identified in these extracts using HPLC-PDA-MS/MS. Both extracts contained predominantly all-<i>trans</i>-lutein as the main component within this class. In order to investigate antioxidant properties, the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) techniques were used. The (3-4,5 dimethylthiazol-2, 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) (MTT) and Crystal Violet assays assessed cellular cytotoxicity. Assessments of presence of reactive species were carried out following exposure of oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line (SCC-4) to various aqueous extracts of <i>M piperita</i> or <i>A vulgaris</i> utilizing dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and nitric oxide (NO) assays. Exposure to these extracts induced severe cytotoxic effects, which led to investigation of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying this observed effect. Data demonstrated that both solutions induced oxidative stress and DNA damage, especially at higher concentrations using agarose gel subjected to electrophoresis. It is known that exposure to excess amounts of antioxidants results in a prooxidant effect which is beneficial in cancer therapy. Further, the extracts were found to reduce viability of SCC-4 in culture, indicating that this antitumoral activity may be of therapeutic importance and requires further study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Santa-Maria, RS, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Rossato Viana", "ForeName": "Altevir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Santa-Maria, RS, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Eduardo Lago Londero", "ForeName": "James", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Technology and Food Sciences, Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Santa Maria, RS, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Pinheiro", "ForeName": "Pricila Nass", "Initials": "PN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Technology and Food Sciences, Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Santa Maria, RS, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Acosta", "ForeName": "Patricia", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Santa-Maria, RS, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Duailibe Silva", "ForeName": "Larissa", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Technology and Food Sciences, Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Santa Maria, RS, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Jacob-Lopes", "ForeName": "Eduardo", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanosciences Postgraduate Program, Franciscan University (UFN), Santa Maria, RS, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Ferreira Ourique", "ForeName": "Aline", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Technology and Food Sciences, Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Santa Maria, RS, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Zepka", "ForeName": "Leila Queiroz", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanosciences Postgraduate Program, Franciscan University (UFN), Santa Maria, RS, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Nanoestructurated Magnetic Materials - LaMMaN, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Bohn Rhoden", "ForeName": "Cristiano Rodrigo", "Initials": "CR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Santa-Maria, RS, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Passaglia Schuch", "ForeName": "Andr\u00e9", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Master's in Health and Life Sciences, Franciscan University (UFN), Santa Maria, RS, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Franco", "ForeName": "Camila", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Carotenoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mentha piperita"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Cleavage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carotenoids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38073506", "10.1080/15287394.2023.2291513"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
