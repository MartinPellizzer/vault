Bacterial efflux pumps are active transport proteins that bacterial cells use to protect themselves against multiple toxic compounds, including many antimicrobials. Efflux pump inhibitors from plants can block these efflux pumps, increasing the potency of antimicrobial compounds. This study demonstrates that efflux pump inhibition against the Gram-positive bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is widespread in extracts prepared from individual species throughout the land plant lineage. It therefore suggests a general mechanism by which plants used by indigenous species may be effective as a topical treatment for some bacterial infections.", "The goal of this research was to evaluate the distribution of efflux pump inhibitors in nine plant extracts with an ethnobotanical use suggestive of an antimicrobial function for the presence of efflux pump inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus.", "Plants were collected, dried, extracted, and vouchers submitted to the Herbarium of the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (NCU). The extracts were analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) to determine the presence and concentration of flavonoids with known efflux pump inhibitory activity. A mass spectrometry-based assay was employed to measure efflux pump inhibition for all extracts against Staphylococcus aureus. The assay relies on UPLC-MS measurement of changes in ethidium concentration in the spent culture broth when extracts are incubated with bacteria.", "Eight of these nine plant extracts inhibited toxic compound efflux at concentrations below the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) value for the same extract. The most active extracts were those prepared from Osmunda claytoniana L. and Pinus strobes L., which both demonstrated IC<sub>50</sub> values for efflux inhibition of 19\u00a0ppm.", "Our findings indicate that efflux pump inhibitors active against Staphylococcus aureus are common in land plants. By extension, this activity is likely to be important in many plant-derived antimicrobial extracts, including those used in traditional medicine, and evaluation of efflux pump inhibition may often be valuable when studying natural product efficacy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
