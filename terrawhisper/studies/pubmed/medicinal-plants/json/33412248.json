(Apocynaceae), is a medicinal plant distributed in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Jordan, Spain, and Italy. The different parts of the plant are used traditionally to treat various diseases such as diabetes mellitus, flu, caught, kidney stones, cysts, respiratory infection, cancer, digestives disorders, urogenital infections, metabolic disorders, and cardiovascular problems.", "In this review, previous reports on C.\u00a0europaea concerning its morphological description, geographical distribution, ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemistry, pharmacological properties, and toxicological studies were critically summarized.", "A systematic review of the literature on C.\u00a0europaea was performed by searching the scientific databases Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar.", "In traditional medicine, C.\u00a0europaea used to treat several illnesses including diabetes, cancer, and kidney stones. Our analysis of the previous reports confirmed the scientific evidence of C.\u00a0europaea ethnomedicinal uses, especially the antidiabetic activity. However, there was no clear correlation between previous pharmacological reports on C.\u00a0europaea and its other ethnomedicinal uses in the treatment of kidney stones, flu, caught, metabolic, digestive, cardiovascular and respiratory disorders. The essential oils and extracts of C.\u00a0europaea exhibited several in vitro and in vivo pharmacological properties such as antidiabetic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-proliferative, antibacterial, antimicrobial, toxicological, and immunomodulatory effects. Phytochemical characterization of C.\u00a0europaea revealed the presence of several classes of secondary metabolites such as terpenoids, polyphenols, and flavonoids compounds. Finally, the food preservative ability of the extracts and essential oil obtained from C.\u00a0europaea has been fully discussed.", "Ethnomedicinal surveys indicated the use of C.\u00a0europaea for the treatment of numerous diseases. Pharmacological reports showed that C.\u00a0europaea exhibited significant antidiabetic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-proliferative, antibacterial, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory effects. Further studies on the phytochemistry of bioactive compounds should be performed by using bioactivity-guided isolation strategy and improve their biological potency as well as scientific exploitation of traditional uses. An in-depth investigation is needed to valid the food preservative properties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
