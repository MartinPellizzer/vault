Citrus fruits are economically important with large-scale production of both the fresh fruits and industrially processed products. The extracts and phytochemicals obtained from all parts of C. limon have shown immense therapeutic potential because of their anticancer, anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory nature, and also serve as an important ingredient in the formulation of several ethnic herbal medicines. These properties are mediated by the presence of different phytochemicals, vitamins and nutrients in the citrus fruits.", "The methods involved in the preparation of the present article included the collection of information from various scientific databases, indexed periodicals, and search engines such as Medline Scopus google scholar PubMed, PubMed central web of science, and science direct.", "This communication presents an updated account of different pharmacological aspects of C. limon associated with its anti-oxidative, antiulcer, antihelmintic, insecticidal, anticancer, cytotoxic, and estrogenic activities. In addition, C. limon extracts possess hepatoprotective, anti-hyperglycemic, and antimicrobial properties. The present article includes the structure and function of different key chemical constituents from different parts of C. limon. Also, the possible molecular mechanisms of actions of bioactive compounds from C. limon are displayed.", "The traditional and ethno-medicinal literature revealed that C. limon is very effective in different pathologies. Most of these compounds possessing antioxidant properties would be implicated in offering health benefits by acting as potential nutraceuticals to humans with special reference to disease management of health and disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Allahabad, Allahabad-211002, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Nitika", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Animal Biology, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Gachibowli, Hyderabad 500 046, Telagana, India."}], "LastName": "Yarla", "ForeName": "Nagendra Sastry", "Initials": "NS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, King Saud University, Faculty of Science, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Siddiqi", "ForeName": "Nikhat Jamal", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Sciences & CICECO - Aveiro Institute of Materials, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal."}], "LastName": "de Lourdes Pereira", "ForeName": "Maria", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Allahabad, Allahabad-211002, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Bechan", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101240303", "ISSNLinking": "1573-4064"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Citrus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "46"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32901586", "10.2174/1573406416666200909104050", "MC-EPUB-109804"]}}]}
