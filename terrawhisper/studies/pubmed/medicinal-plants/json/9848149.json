It was found that application of sulphur as ammonium sulphate in quantity up to 75-100 kg S/ha induced proportional increase of sulphoxides in bulbs from 3.03 up to 4.57 mg/g. Subsequent increasing of the sulphur doses applied did not induce any trustworthy changes. When potassium sulphate was used for feeding similar results were obtained. The potassium and nitrogen increase equivalent to the amounts of them applied together with sulphur did not induce any trustworthy changes too. Also it was registered the garlic variety sulphur nutrition specificity, that was closely connected with degree of the floral spear development. So, in the bulbs of non-spear-forming variety (Ukrainian white) the maximal increasing of the sulphoxide content was 78.6% against control whereas for Boguslavsky 10, the variety with most advanced floral spear (with height up to 125 cm), the increasing of sulphoxides was only 43.6%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Taras Shevchenko Kyiv University."}], "LastName": "Kosian", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Vplyv sirchanoho zhyvlennia na nakopychennia sul'foksydiv u lynakh chasnyku."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ukraine", "MedlineTA": "Ukr Biokhim Zh (1978)", "NlmUniqueID": "7804246", "ISSNLinking": "0201-8470"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "70FD1KFU70", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RWP5GA015D", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfoxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9848149"]}}]}
