The enzyme flavonol synthase (FLS, EC 1.14.20.6) catalyses the conversion of dihydroflavonols to flavonols. Whereas flavonoid 3'-monooxygenase (F3'H, EC 1.14.14.82) catalyses the hydroxylation of dihydroflavonol, and flavonol. FLS is involved in the synthesis of the kaempferol whereas F3'H causes degradation of kaempferol. The present study aimed to analyse the binding affinity, stability and activating activity of enzyme FLS as well as inhibitory activity of enzyme F3'H involved in the enrichment of the kaempferol using the <i>in-silico</i> approaches. Computational study for physico-chemical properties, conserved domain identification, 3-D structure prediction and its validation, conservation analysis, molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics analysis of FLS and F3'H, protein-activator (FLS-LIG Complex) and protein-inhibitor (F3'H-LIG Complex) complexes have been performed. Other structural analyses like root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), root mean square deviation (RMSD), surface area solvent accessibility (SASA), radius of gyration (Rg), hydrogen bond analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), Poisson-Boltzmann analysis (MM_PBSA) and the dynamic cross correlation map (DCCM) analysis to explore the structural, functional and thermodynamic stability of the proteins and the complexes were also studied. The molecular docking result showed that FLS binds strongly with the activator ascorbate (CID _54670067) while F3'H binds with the inhibitor ketoconazole (CID_456201). The most powerful inhibitor (ketoconazole for F3'H) and activator (ascorbate for FLS) is determined by computing the thermodynamic binding free energy through MM_PBSA analysis. The current work provides wide-ranging structural and functional information about FLS and F3'H enzymes showing detailed molecular mechanism of kaempferol biosynthesis and its degradation and hence kaempferol enrichment. Finding of the present work opens up new possibilities for future research towards enrichment of kaempferol by using activator (ascorbate) for FLS and inhibitor (ketoconazole) for F3'H as well as for its large-scale production using <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> approaches.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
