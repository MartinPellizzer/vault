Aconitine-type C<sub>19</sub>-diterpenoid alkaloids accumulating in the lateral roots are some of the main toxicants of this species, yet their biosynthesis remains largely unresolved. As a first step towards understanding the biosynthesis of aconitine-type C<sub>19</sub>-diterpenoid alkaloids, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly and analysis of rootstocks and leaf tissues of Aconitum carmichaelii by next-generation sequencing. A total of 525 unigene candidates were identified as involved in the formation of C<sub>19</sub>-diterpenoid alkaloids, including those encoding enzymes in the early steps of diterpenoid alkaloids scaffold biosynthetic pathway, such as ent-copalyl diphosphate synthases, ent-kaurene synthases, kaurene oxidases, cyclases, and key aminotransferases. Furthermore, candidates responsible for decorating of diterpenoid alkaloid skeletons were discovered from transcriptome sequencing of fuzi, such as monooxygenases, methyltransferase, and BAHD acyltransferases. In addition, 645 differentially expressed genes encoding transcription factors potentially related to diterpenoid alkaloids accumulation underground were documented. Subsequent modular domain structure phylogenetics and differential expression analysis led to the identification of BAHD acyltransferases possibly involved in the formation of acetyl and benzoyl esters of diterpenoid alkaloids, associated with the acute toxicity of fuzi. The transcriptome data provide the foundation for future research into the molecular basis for aconitine-type C<sub>19</sub>-diterpenoid alkaloids biosynthesis in A.\u00a0carmichaelii."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
