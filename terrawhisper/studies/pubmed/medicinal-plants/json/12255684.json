According to the results reached in research, phytoestrogens, antiestrogens, antigonadotrophic substances, strumatogen ic substances may be considered antifertility substances of plant provenience. The volume of these substances in plants varies depending on many factors, and their effect on the reproductive process differs according to various kinds of animals, sex, stage of reproductive cycle, and other biofactors. A more pronounced effect is recorded in female animals with a low progesterone level. The mode of action on sexual process has not been fully explained so far. The presence of phytoestrogens causes in bovine females hormonal imbalance and influences relations between the hypophysisis and the ovary, thus giving rise to a hyperestrogenic syndrome with all its concomitant symptoms. Antiestrogens block the physiological effect of ovarial estrogen in females and in this way also influence the reversive control mechanism (feedback) of reproduction via the adenohypophysis. Antigonadotropic substances inactivate gonadotropins (both in vivo and in vitro) and block their effect, particularly luteinizing hormone components, and bring about ovulation disorders. Thyroidogenic substances directly influence the function of the thyroid and through it the gonadotropic production of the anterior lobe of hypophysis resulting in sexual cycle regulation disorders."]}], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "PMID": "12255684", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1980", "Month": "01", "Day": "03"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "11"}, "Article": {"Language": ["ger"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0044-5371", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1968"}}, "Title": "Zuchthygiene", "ISOAbbreviation": "Zuchthygiene"}, "ArticleTitle": "[Estrogenic and antigonadotropic substances in plants and the effect of such substances on reproduction in female domestic animals].", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "133", "EndPage": "141", "MedlinePgn": "133-41"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kudlac", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chury", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Ostrogene und antigonadotrope Substanzen in Pflanzen und der Einfluss de rartiger Stoffe auf die Geschlechtsfunktionen der weiblichen Haustiere."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Zuchthygiene", "NlmUniqueID": "0056272", "ISSNLinking": "0044-5371"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hormones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Estrogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hormones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1968", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1968", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12255684"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
