However, it is unclear whether antihypertension is dependent on the protective effect of 1,8-Cineole on endothelial function and structure. At present, the purpose was to investigate the protective effects of 1,8-Cineole on vascular endothelial tissue in hypertensive rats and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Our results showed that 1,8-Cineole significantly reduced the blood pressure and improved the vascular endothelial lesion, attenuated vascular oxidative stress and inflammation induced by N\u03c9-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) in rats. Pretreatment with 1,8-Cineole was able to inhibit the increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by L-NAME, and increased the release and expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and nitric oxide (NO). In addition, 1,8-Cineole also reversed the increase of autophagy-associated protein LC3\u2161/LC3\u2160 and the decrease of P62 in vivo and in vitro respectively. There was a synergistic effect between PI3K agonists and drugs, while PI3K inhibitors blocked the efficacy of 1,8-Cineole. The addition of autophagy inhibitor chloroquine increases the expression of eNOS. Taken together, our results indicate that 1,8-Cineole has potential beneficial promising antihypertension depending on the integrity of vascular endothelial structure and function induced by L-NAME, and the mechanism involves ameliorating autophagy by regulating of PI3K/mTOR."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
