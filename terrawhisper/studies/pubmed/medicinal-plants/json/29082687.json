With the development of Perilla domain in recent , the breeding and application of good varieties has become the main bottleneck of its development. This study reported that applied to the system selection, add to marker-assisted method to breed perilla varieties. Through the whole genome sequencing and consistency matching, annotated the mutation locus according to genome data, and comparison analysis with Perilla common variants database, finally selected 30 non-synonymous mutation SNPs used as characteristic markers of Zhongyan Feishu No.1. those SNP marker were used as chosen standard of Perilla varieties. Finally breeding new perilla variety Zhongyan Feishu No.1, which possess to characters of the leaf and seed dual-used, high yield, high resistance, and could used to green fertilizer. The Zhongyan Feishu No.1 acquired the plant new varieties identification of Beijing city , the identification numbers is 2016054. Marker assisted identification guide new varieties breeding in plants, which can provide a new reference for breeding of medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Rapeseed reaearch institute, Guizhou Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guiyang 550008, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yu-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Rapeseed reaearch institute, Guizhou Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guiyang 550008, China."}], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Zhi-Wei", "Initials": "ZW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shi-Lin", "Initials": "SL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Genetic Markers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Markers"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Perilla frutescens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29082687", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170418.001"]}}]}
