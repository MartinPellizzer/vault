RR chemical composition, radical scavenging effect and oxidative stability were evaluated. RR aqueous emulsions were examined for cell cytotoxicity, proliferation, redox state and migration using mouse embryonic fibroblast Balb/3T3, human dermal fibroblast NHDF cell lines, and on neoplastic cell lines: acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 and lung adenocarcinoma A549. RR total contents of phytosterols, tocopherols, carotenoids and phenolics were 10115.23, 784.16, 40.32 and 10.30\u00a0mg/kg, respectively. Rich antioxidant composition of RR was reflected in its high antioxidant activity (2.1\u00a0mM/kg Trolox equivalent) as well as oxidative stability (activation energy 105.6\u00a0kJ/mol). The RR emulsions led to marked augmentation of the total cell protein content in BALB/3T3 and NHDF cultures, inhibited cancer cell migration and reduced ROS formation. The studied RR oil proved to have a remarkable combination of bioactive compounds and to exert an antioxidative and chemopreventive effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
