With or without the plant extracts in culture medium, the motility of adult worms, microfilariae and microfilarial release from female worms were monitored daily. After 7 days of culture, viability or tissue damage of adult worms was assessed using the MTT assay. At > 500 microg ml-1, the aqueous extract significantly reduced motility of adult females after 24 h of exposure and adult males after 3 days. The aqueous extract, at > 500 microg ml-1, also significantly reduced microfilarial release from female worms, starting on day 2. The reduction in the motility of adult worms and the pattern of microfilarial release from female worms were concentration and time dependent. The MTT assay results revealed that adult worms cultured in the presence of aqueous extracts at > 500 microg ml-1 were damaged. However, the aqueous extract did not affect the motility of microfilariae with the exception of those in higher concentration extracts. Higher concentrations of ethanol extracts (2 mg ml-1) inhibited both the motility of adult worms and the release of microfilariae from females. Little effect of ethanol extracts was detected by the MTT assay, as only slight damage was caused to worms exposed only to the highest concentration (2 mg ml-1). However, ethanol extract at 500 microg ml-1 rapidly reduced the motility of microfilariae on day 2. The present study revealed that an aqueous extract of C. halicacabum has mild but definite direct macrofilaricidal action on B. pahangi."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002, Thailand. watkhu@kku.ac.th"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khunkitti", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fujimaki", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aoki", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Helminthol", "NlmUniqueID": "2985115R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-149X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Filaricides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Brugia pahangi"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Filaricides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Microfilariae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Parasitic Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10953224", "10.1017/s0022149x00000342", "S0022149X00000342"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
