The metabolite profile of C. guangdongensis is similar to that of Ophiocordyceps sinensis. In plants and animals, microRNAs play important roles in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. MicroRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) have been documented in several macro-fungi. To comprehensively investigate the milRNAs in C. guangdongensis, three small RNA libraries from the differentially developmental stages were constructed. Twenty-six conserved milRNAs were identified, and 19 novel milRNA candidates were predicted. Among them, 20 milRNAs were differentially expressed across the developmental processes, and 12 milRNAs were verified using stem-loop quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In addition, the potential target genes of milRNA were predicted to be involved in the development of fruiting bodies and metabolite biosynthesis. This study is the first to report the milRNAs of C. guangdongensis, and provides important insights into studies of milRNA regulation pathways in ascomycete fungi."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
