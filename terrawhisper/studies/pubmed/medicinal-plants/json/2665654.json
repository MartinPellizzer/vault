In the present study, we investigated in vivo dynamics and renal impairment under 1 h of continuous drip infusion of CDDP. The free-type Pt concentration ratio, which is considered to indicate antitumor activity in the overall plasma Pt concentration at the end of the administration, was noted to be approximately 64%. This was significantly higher than other administration methods, making this an effective administration procedure. However, NAG, which is considered to be an index of renal impairment along with the amount of beta 2-microglobulin urine excretion, showed higher values than those by other administration methods. Thus, using the 1-hr continuous CDDP drip infusion, we attempted to alleviate the renal impairment, combining bismuth subnitrate with ginseng and Tang-koui ten. As a result, the amount of beta 2-microglobulin excretion in the urine was diminished as well as NAG, and a reduction of the renal impairment was noted. These alleviational effects of the renal impairment were attributed to the method of consistent oral administration by which alleviation could take place with little load on the patient."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Pharmacy, Nagoya National Hospital."}], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Takagi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hishida", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sakamoto", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Takagi", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Amano", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ogura", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Gan To Kagaku Ryoho", "NlmUniqueID": "7810034", "ISSNLinking": "0385-0684"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "beta 2-Microglobulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.52", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylglucosaminidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H19J064BA5", "NameOfSubstance": "bismuth subnitrate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q20Q21Q62J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cisplatin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U015TT5I8H", "NameOfSubstance": "Bismuth"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylglucosaminidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Bismuth"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cisplatin"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infusions, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "beta 2-Microglobulin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2665654"]}}]}
