This study explored a novel method for quality evaluation of herbal medicines. High-performance liquid chromatography fingerprints and the osteoblast proliferation activity of 18 batches of Achyranthes bidentata, which were prepared with salt, were determined to establish a chromatographic database and an activity database. Correlation analyses of these databases were performed using partial least squares to obtain regression coefficients (positive and negative correlation coefficients). Then, the sums of the products of the positive and negative correlation peak areas and the corresponding coefficients, respectively, were calculated for each sample. The absolute value of the ratios of the sums of the positive and negative products were calculated, our studies showed that this ratio was significantly correlated with the proliferation activity, particularly when the activity was in the best and worst ranges. Therefore, we developed a parameter that was used to evaluate the quality of samples osteoblast proliferation activity. The quality of another ten batches of samples was assessed to verify this method. The results indicated that this method can be used for quality evaluation of herbal medicines according to the dynamic changes in the chemical compounds and activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
