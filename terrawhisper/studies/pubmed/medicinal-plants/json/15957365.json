It is well known that the treatment of TJ-48 result in the decrease of patient's complaints, as well as the increase of NK cytolytic activity (NK activity) although its augmentation is not clear in the other kampo formula from the clinical viewpoint. To investigate its biological activities, such as the augmentation of NK activity, we analyzed the effects of TJ-48 on the expression of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) in vitro experiment. The peripheral lymphocytes were incubated in medium alone, or medium containing TJ-48 or interleukin-2 (IL-2) plus TJ-48 at several concentrations for 48 h. After each incubation, cells were collected and their KIRs were detected by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies CD158a and CD158b. TJ-48 increased the populations of CD16+CD158a+ and CD16+CD158b+ cells in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, CD16-CD158a/b+ cells did not increase. Additionally, the extract of TJ-48 enhanced the increase of KIRs expression induced by IL-2. These actions contribute to the augmentation of NK cytolytic activity by TJ-48, and might explain, in part, its antitumor effects which has been observed in vivo."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Integrated Japanese Oriental Medicine, School of Medicine, Gunma University, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan. tkogure@showa.gunma-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kogure", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ltoh", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tatsumi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sekiya", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sakai", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shimada", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tamura", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Terasawa", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Phytomedicine", "NlmUniqueID": "9438794", "ISSNLinking": "0944-7113"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CD8 Antigens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "juzentaihoto"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "CD8 Antigens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Killer Cells, Natural"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Immunologic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15957365", "10.1016/j.phymed.2004.05.002", "S0944-7113(05)00019-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
