Interviews were conducted with 304 people in whom 270 people were of villages in the four directions while 18 were traditional medicine dealers or Ayurveda consultants and 16 were knowable people.", "Total 67 plant species belonging to 40 families were encountered during the study. The most predominant families in terms of number of species were Asteraceae and Papilionaceae with 5 species each. In the four directions, the people of eastern direction were found to have maximum knowledge of antilithic plants, but the Ayurveda consultants and knowable people were found to have much more knowledge than all the general people of the villages. Nine plant species, namely, Citrullus lanatus Thunb.(Cucurbitaceae), Malva sylvestris L. (Malvaceae), Urginea indica (Roxb.) Kunth (Liliaceae), Bauhinia variegata L. (Caesalpiniaceae), Dolichos uniflorus L.(Papilionaceae), Psidium guajava L. (Myrtaceae), Calotropis procera (Ait.) R.Br. (Asclepiadaceae), Picrorhiza kurroa Royle ex Benth. (Plantaginaceae) and Piper longum L. (Piperaceae) was not found to be previously mentioned for the treatment of lithiasis. Boerhaavia diffusa L. was found to have the highest use value. On the basis of habit of these plants, herbs constituted 41.79% of the total plant species used.", "From this study, it can be concluded that complete ethnobotanical knowledge can be gained only when thorough literature survey along with field survey with respect to common man, traditional medicine dealers or Ayurveda consultants and knowable people has been extensively undertaken. This study will help in making the people aware about the selected plants or other suggested plants for use in lithiasis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
