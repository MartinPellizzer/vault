Due to the present therapeutic interventions and progressive nature of diseases, a variety of side effects have risen up, thus leading the patients to go for an alternative medication. The role of medicinal plants in such cases has been beneficial because of their exhibition via different cellular and molecular mechanisms. Alleviation in inflammatory responses, suppression of the functionary aspect of pro-inflammatory cytokines like a tumor, improvement in antioxidative properties is among few neuroprotective mechanisms of traditional plants. Variation in transcription and transduction pathways plays a vital role in the preventive measures of plants in such diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases are generally caused by the depletion of proteins, oxidative and inflammatory stress, environmental changes and so on, with aging being the most important cause. Natural compounds can be used in order to treat neurodegenerative diseases Medicinal plants such as Ginseng, Withania somnifera, Bacopa monnieri, Ginkgo biloba, etc. are some of the medicinal plants for the prevention of neurological symptoms. This review deals with the use of different medicinal plants for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Delhi Technological University, Delhi,India."}], "LastName": "Luthra", "ForeName": "Ritika", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, School of Engineering & Technology, Sharda University, Greater Noida,India."}], "LastName": "Roy", "ForeName": "Arpita", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Withania"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "39"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33573549", "10.2174/1389201022666210211123539", "CPB-EPUB-114129"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
