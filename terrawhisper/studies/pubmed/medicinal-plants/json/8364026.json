The structure was refined at 2.3-A resolution with a combination of molecular dynamics refinement and classical restrained least-squares refinement. The final R value for all data Fo > 1 sigma (Fo) between 7.0- and 2.3-A resolution is 0.164%, and deviations from ideal bond distances are 0.014 A. The C-terminus of the beta-chain proved to be 23 amino acids longer than found in previous studies. This together with several inconsistencies between the previously determined amino acid sequence and the observed electron density forced a redetermination of the amino acid sequence of the protein. The overall structure is very similar to that of pea lectin and isolectin I of Lathyrus ochrus, the most prominent deviations being confined to loop regions and the regions of intermolecular contact. The largest difference between the pea and lentil lectin monomers is situated in the loop region of amino acids 73-79 of the beta chain. There are no significant differences between the two crystallographic independent lentil lectin monomers in the asymmetric unit. The model includes 104 well-defined water molecules, of which a significant number have a counterpart in the pea lectin structure. As for the other legume lectins, each lentil lectin monomer contains one calcium ion in a highly conserved environment. On the contrary, the manganese binding sites are distorted with respect to the pea lectin and concanavalin A structures. The Asp beta 121 side chain apparently does not ligate the Mn2+ ion. This difference is consistent in both lentil lectin monomers and agrees with earlier solution studies. Possible implications for oligosaccharide binding are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratorium voor Ultrastructuur, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Sint-Genesius-Rode, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Loris", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Steyaert", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maes", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lisgarten", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pickersgill", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wyns", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0370623", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2960"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "lentil lectin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Biochemistry. 1993 Dec 28;32(51):14229. doi: 10.1021/bi00214a024", "PMID": "8260509"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Processing, Post-Translational"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8364026", "10.1021/bi00085a007"]}}]}
