Sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), an essential member of the sirtuins family, has been proven to be a critical sirtuin in regulating mitochondrial function. The phenolic glucoside gastrodin (GAS), a bioactive ingredient from Gastrodiae Rhizome (known in Chinese as Tian ma) demonstrates significant neuroprotective properties against central nervous system disorders; however, the precise mechanisms through which GAS modulates VaD remain elusive.", "This study aims to investigate whether GAS confers a protective role against VaD, and to figure out the underlying molecular mechanisms.", "A bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO)-mediated chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) VaD rat model and a hypoxia model using HT22 cells were employed to investigate pharmacological properties of GAS in mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction. A SIRT3 agonist resveratrol (RES), a SIRT3 inhibitor 3-TYP and SIRT3-knockdown in vitro were used to explore the mechanism of GAS in association with SIRT3. The ability of SIRT3 to bind and deacetylate mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) was detected by immunoprecipitation assay, and TFAM acetylation sites were further validated using mass spectrometry.", "GAS increased SIRT3 expression and ameliorated mitochondrial structure, mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial dynamics along with upregulated TFAM, mitigating oxidative stress and senescence. Comparable results were noted with the SIRT3 agonist RES, indicating an impactful neuroprotection played by SIRT3. Specifically, the attenuation of SIRT3 expression through knockdown techniques or exposure to the SIRT3 inhibitor 3-TYP in HT22 cells markedly abrogated GAS-mediated mitochondrial rescuing function. Furthermore, our findings elucidate a novel facet: SIRT3 interacted with and deacetylated TFAM at the K5, K7, and K8 sites. Decreased SIRT3 is accompanied by hyper-acetylated TFAM.", "The present results were the first to demonstrate that the SIRT3/TFAM pathway is a protective target for reversing mitochondrial dysfunction in VaD. The findings suggest that GAS-mediated modulation of the SIRT3/TFAM pathway, a novel mechanism, could ameliorate CCH-induced VaD, offering a potentially beneficial therapeutic strategy for VaD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier GmbH.
