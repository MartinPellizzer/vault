Typical apoptotic changes were observed in RKO cells under the fluorescence microscope and the light microscope. DNA ladder was detected on agarose gels at concentrations from 10 microg x mL(-1) to 20 microg x mL(-1) at 48 h. With FCM methods, dose-dependent apoptosis-induced effect was observed in RKO cell line after treatment of triterpene for 48 h, and the apoptotic rates were increased from(2.93 +/- 0.84) % to (50.79 +/- 6.61) % at concentrations from 2.5 microg x mL(-1) to 20 microg x mL(-1).
