To the best of our knowledge, compound 1 represents the first C13 nor-sesquiterpenoid with a five membered carbon ring. Compounds 2 and 3 are rare C14 chained nor-sesquiterpenoids. Their structures were fully characterized based on extensive spectroscopic data and quantum chemistry calculation. Three compounds (1, 2, and 4) showed potent inhibitory effects on lipid accumulation in an oleic acid-treated HepG2 cell model. In particular, compound 2 exhibited the most potent inhibitory effect on triglyceride accumulation at a low concentration of 2.5 \u03bcM, better than the positive control atorvastatin. The plausible biosynthetic pathway of the three nor-sesquiterpenoids (1-3) is also proposed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of
