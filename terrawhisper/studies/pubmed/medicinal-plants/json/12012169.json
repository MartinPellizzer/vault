In recent years there has been increasing interest worldwide in the use of alternative/herbal medicine for the prevention and treatment of various illnesses. Currently, however, quality-related problems (lack of consistency, safety, and efficacy) seem to be overshadowing the potential genuine health benefits of various herbal products. Thus, the development of \"modern\" sample-preparation techniques with significant advantages over conventional methods for the extraction and analysis of medicinal plants is likely to play an important role in the overall effort of ensuring and providing high-quality herbal products to consumers worldwide. In this article, recent developments and applications of modern sample-preparation techniques for the extraction, clean-up, and concentration of analytes from medicinal plants or herbal materials are reviewed. These modern techniques include solid-phase microextraction, supercritical-fluid extraction, pressurized-liquid extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, solid-phase extraction, and surfactant-mediated extraction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong. cwhuie@net1.hkbu.edu.hk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huie", "ForeName": "Carmen W", "Initials": "CW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Anal Bioanal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101134327", "ISSNLinking": "1618-2642"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Specimen Handling"}], "NumberOfReferences": "81"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12012169", "10.1007/s00216-002-1265-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
