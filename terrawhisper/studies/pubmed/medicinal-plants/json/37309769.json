Diuretics are used as a primary treatment in patients with edema associated with liver cirrhosis and kidney diseases, hyperkalemia, hypertension, heart failure, or renal failure. Furthermore, they are also used to increase the excretion of sodium and reduce blood volume. Due to various adverse events associated with synthetic diuretics, there is a need to investigate alternate plant-based bioactive components that have effective diuretic activity with minimal side effects.", "This review compiled the reported bioactive compounds from different plant sources along with their mechanisms of diuretic activity.", "Different sources were used to collect information regarding herbal plants with therapeutic value as diuretics. These included published peer-reviewed journal articles, scholarly articles from StatPearls, and search engines like Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Springer, ScienceDirect, Wiley, etc. Results: In this review, it was found that flavonoids like rutin, acacetin, naringenin, etc. showed significant diuretic activity in experimental models by various mechanisms, but mostly by blocking the sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporter, while some bioactive compounds showed diuretic actions via other mechanisms as well.", "Research on clinical trials of these isolated bioactive compounds needs to be further conducted. Thus, this review provides an understanding of the potential diuretic bioactive compounds of plants for further research and pharmaceutical applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4597-8988"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Integral University, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Manvi"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3773-6911"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Integral University, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Mohammad Irfan", "Initials": "MI"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5311-9051"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Integral University, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Badruddeen"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2219-370X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Integral University, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Akhtar", "ForeName": "Juber", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1776-6294"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Integral University, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0343-132X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Integral University, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Siddiqui", "ForeName": "Zeba", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0577-8191"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Integral University, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Fatima", "ForeName": "Gayyur", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Hypertens Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "101239891", "ISSNLinking": "1573-4021"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diuretics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9NEZ333N27", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Diuretics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diuresis"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy", "chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37309769", "10.2174/1573402119666230612115220", "CHYR-EPUB-132466"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
