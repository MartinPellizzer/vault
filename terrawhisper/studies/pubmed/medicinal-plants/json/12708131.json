Clinical findings revealed higher percentage of relief in cardinal and general symptoms with decrement in the pulse rate and in the respiration rate. A significant linear increase in PEFR value was observed before and after treatment and an increase in FEV1 values measured in Group I subjects. There was relief of all symptoms in a significant number of patients. Occurrence of relief was observed only among patients who suffer less than 10 years duration with Tamak Swasa and among those the frequency of attacks of Tamak Swasa was at fortnightly or monthly intervals. Antispasmodic activity of Devadaru Compound (DC) on acetylcholine (Ach) induced contractions using rat ileum preparation was studied. The results demonstrated that DC inhibits Ach-induced contractions significantly and bears a dose-response relationship. This suggests that DC has got anti-spasmodic activity and corroborates the clinical findings. The clinical findings and experimental studies show that DC is of significant use in the treatment of Tamak Swasa (Bronchial Asthma) and superior to the standard and placebo therapy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ayurvedic Medical College, Bidar-585 403."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sekhar", "ForeName": "A V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gandhi", "ForeName": "D N", "Initials": "DN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "N Mohan", "Initials": "NM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rawal", "ForeName": "U D", "Initials": "UD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0374707", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5499"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chi-Square Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ileum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12708131"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
