We used an appropriate system to fabricate an electrospun bioactive scaffold with controlled release of PDGF-BB in order to induce migration of primary skin fibroblast cells. First of all, protein-loaded chitosan nanoparticles based on ionic gelation interaction between chitosan and sodium tripolyphosphate were prepared. Then polycaprolactone electrospun fibers containing chitosan nanoparticles or PDGF-BB-loaded chitosan nanoparticles were prepared. Cellular attachment and morphology of cells seeded on scaffolds with or without PDGF-BB were evaluated by using a fluorescence microscope and scanning electron microscopy. Cells were well-oriented 72\u2009h after seeding on the scaffolds containing PDGF-BB. The mean aspect ratio of populations on scaffold containing PDGF-BB-loaded chitosan nanoparticles was significantly greater than those on the scaffold containing chitosan nanoparticles but no PDGF-BB. Furthermore, the Arp2 gene, which is involved in cell protrusion formation, showed about three times more expression at mRNA level, in cells seeding on PDGF-BB-containing scaffold compared to cells seeding on scaffold containing only chitosan nanoparticles, using Real Time PCR test. Finally, under agarose migration assay results demonstrated that cells' chemotaxic behavior was more toward scaffold containing PDGF-BB compared to the PDGF-BB alone or FBS group. In addition, in terms of distance, the cell mass could grow faster, in response to scaffold containing PDGF-BB compared to FBS or PDGF-BB alone; however, the number of migrating cells might be the same or significantly higher in the latter groups."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Stem Cell Technology Research Center , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Piran", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Stem Cell Technology Research Center , Tehran , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Laboratory for Stem Cell Research & Regenerative Medicine , Chair of Oman's Medicinal Plants & Marine Natural Products, University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Vakilian", "ForeName": "Saeid", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Drug Design and Bioinformatics Unit, Medical Biotechnology Department , Biotechnology Research Center, Pasteur Institute of Iran , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Piran", "ForeName": "Mehran", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Animal and Poultry Science, College of Aburaihan , University of Tehran , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammadi-Sangcheshmeh", "ForeName": "Abdollah", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Tissue engineering and Applied Cell Sciences, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine , Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseinzadeh", "ForeName": "Simzar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Tissue engineering and Applied Cell Sciences, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine , Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Ardeshirylajimi", "ForeName": "Abdolreza", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101594777", "ISSNLinking": "2169-1401"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Delayed-Action Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Carriers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1B56C968OA", "NameOfSubstance": "Becaplermin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9012-76-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Chitosan"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol. 2018;46(sup1):1003. doi: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1441643", "PMID": "29468893"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bandages"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Becaplermin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Movement"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chitosan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delayed-Action Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Carriers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Liberation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electricity"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanofibers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29361857", "10.1080/21691401.2018.1430698"]}}]}
