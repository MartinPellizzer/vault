It was demonstrated, using techniques of molecular genetics, that a group of Rhizobium nodulation genes (nod genes) co-operate to synthesize a lipo-oligosaccharide signal molecule that specifically initiates nodule development on legume hosts. An additional gene function, encoded by nodX, has been found to extend the host range of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae to include nodulation of a pea mutant, cultivar Afghanistan; the nodX gene product specifies the addition of an acetyl group to the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residue at the reducing end of the pentasaccharide core of this signal molecule. Several other classes of bacterial glycoconjugate have also been shown by genetic analysis to be essential for normal nodule development and function: these include a capsular extracellular polysaccharide; lipopolysaccharide in the outer membrane; and cyclic glucans present in the periplasmic space. Potential functions for these glycoconjugates are discussed in the context of tissue and cell invasion by Rhizobium. Some plant components involved in symbiotic interactions have been identified by the analysis of nodule-specific gene expression (early nodulins). Several of the cDNA clones encoding these early nodulins specify proline-rich proteins that presumably correspond to cell wall glycoproteins or membrane arabinogalactan proteins. Other plant glycoconjugates have been identified using monoclonal antibodies as probes. A plant glycoprotein present in intercellular spaces has been identified as a component of the luminal matrix of infection threads. Because it attaches to the surface of bacteria and is itself susceptible to oxidative cross-linking, this glycoprotein may be involved in limiting the progress of microbial infections. Endocytosis of bacteria into the plant cytoplasm is apparently driven by direct interactions between the bacterial surface and the plasma membrane that is exposed within an unwalled infection droplet; glycoprotein and glycolipid components of the plant membrane glycocalyx have been defined using monoclonal antibodies. Differentiation of endosymbiotic bacteroids is preceded by differentiation of the plant-derived peribacteroid membrane which encloses the symbiosome compartment. Using a monoclonal antibody that identifies a group of plant membrane-associated, inositol-containing glycolipids, we have identified a very early marker for the differentiation of peribacteroid membrane from plasma membrane."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "John Innes Institute, Norwich, U.K."}], "LastName": "Brewin", "ForeName": "N J", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rae", "ForeName": "A L", "Initials": "AL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Perotto", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kannenberg", "ForeName": "E L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rathbun", "ForeName": "E A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lucas", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gunder", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bola\u00f1os", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kardailsky", "ForeName": "I V", "Initials": "IV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wilson", "ForeName": "K E", "Initials": "KE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Soc Symp", "NlmUniqueID": "7506896", "ISSNLinking": "0067-8694"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoconjugates"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoconjugates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Symbiosis"}], "NumberOfReferences": "38"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7639793"]}}]}
