These indices decreased in a highly correlated manner. A ploidy variation may exist between epidermal cells and leaf-margin hair cells. Using the leaf-margin hair cells model, six nuclear macromolecule indices (total nucleic acid, DNA, RNA, total nuclear protein, histone and non-histone protein), nuclear volume, nucleolar volume and perinucleolar volume (measured using quantitative epifluorescence-phase contrast microscopy) all declined with age (42-day study) in a highly correlated manner. The degeneration of the nucleus and nucleolus in the three leaf locations studied followed the patterns observed for programmed cellular senescence and death (necrosis) in epidermal cells of onion leaf bases (stored tissue; leaf bases did not contain chlorophyll) and human epithelial cells (buccal; cervical). We conclude that the epidermal cells and leaf-margin hair cells from green leaves of the May Apple are ideal for the study of programmed cell senescence and death in plants, especially for the partitioning of this process into the study of: the point-of-no-return (solubilization of the karyoskeleton and loss of non-histone proteins and RNA associated with the karyoskeleton from the nucleus); nuclear pycnosis (loss of nuclear dry mass and volume and loss of nuclear internal support structure); chromatin condensation, margination along the inner nuclear envelope; and DNA-histone degeneration; degeneration of the nucleolus and loss of the perinucleolar zone of exclusion. The characterization of chlorenchyma cells during the 42-day period should now be undertaken (leaf senescence as indicated by the beginning of yellowing about 35 days after emergence) to determine whether these cells with functional chloroplasts undergo nuclear changes like those lacking functional chloroplasts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Indiana University Northwest, Gary 46408, USA."}], "LastName": "Bhattacharya", "ForeName": "P K", "Initials": "PK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pappelis", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "BeMiller", "ForeName": "J N", "Initials": "JN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Karagiannis", "ForeName": "C S", "Initials": "CS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Mech Ageing Dev", "NlmUniqueID": "0347227", "ISSNLinking": "0047-6374"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Histones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nuclear Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Nuclear"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Allium"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Death"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Nucleolus"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cellular Senescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Histones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nuclear Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Podophyllum"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Nuclear"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Plant"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9080390", "10.1016/s0047-6374(96)01804-0", "S0047-6374(96)01804-0"]}}]}
