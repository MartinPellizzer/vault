At four hours the severity of bleeding was assessed by a lesion scoring system and expressed as medians and quartiles. In a separate study two groups of rats (n = 7) received ASA (128 mg/kg) or ASA plus DGL (2000 mg/kg) and salicylate levels measured in serial tail blood samples at 20, 40, 60 and 80 minutes. Lesion scores were increased from 6(3;10) with ASA alone to 12(5;16) by TDC (p less than 0.05) and reduced by DGL to 1(0;3.5) for ASA alone and 3.5(0;6) for ASA plus TDC (p less than 0.0005 in both cases). In the second study a slight reduction of ASA absorption was found only at 20 minutes with a median level of 0.9 mmol/l for the DGL treated rats and 1.2 mmol/l for the ASA alone group (p less than 0.05). No differences were found at the other times. We have also demonstrated that although DGL diminished ASA (128 mg/kg)-induced gastric mucosal damage from 17(12;25) to 8(3;14) (p less than 0.005) when the two were given together it did not do so significantly when DGL was given before ASA--15(20;22). Intraperitoneal DGL reduced lesion scores from ASA (128 mg/kg) from 14(11;24) to 7(1;19) (p less than 0.03), thus indicating a systemic as well as a local effect of the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Russell", "ForeName": "R I", "Initials": "RI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Morgan", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nelson", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Scand J Gastroenterol Suppl", "NlmUniqueID": "0437034", "ISSNLinking": "0085-5928"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bile Acids and Salts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "deglycyrrhizinized liquorice"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R16CO5Y76E", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspirin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aspirin"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Bile Acids and Salts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6588541"]}}]}
