We did a randomized, placebo-controlled trial which included 62 patients, receiving either M.\u00a0officinalis capsules (700\u00a0mg/d; n\u00a0=\u00a031) or the placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a031) twice daily for 12\u00a0weeks. There were significant differences in serum FBS (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007), HbA<sub>1c</sub> (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002), \u03b2-cell activity (P\u00a0=\u00a00.05), TG (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04), HDL-c (P\u00a0=\u00a00.05), hs-CRP (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and systolic blood pressure (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) between the two groups at the end of the study; but total cholesterol, LDL-c, insulin, and HOMA-IR showed no significant changes between the groups. In M.\u00a0officinalis group, there was a significant change in HDL-c (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009) and QUICKI (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005) compared with baseline values. No adverse effects were observed.
