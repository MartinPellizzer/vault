The membrane disruption was quasi-instantaneous (2-3 s) with both detergents, as shown by the decrease of turbidity and the stopping of respiration. In pea leaf mitochondria, Lubrol triggered ATP hydrolysis in almost the same way as valinomycin plus nigericin, except that the activity was slightly stimulated and became insensitive to carboxyatractyloside. This allowed investigations of ATP hydrolysis without any interference of the ATP/ADP antiporter or the phosphate carrier. Lubrol did not prevent the ATPase from deactivating in pea leaf mitochondria, and did not trigger any ATP hydrolysis in potato tuber mitochondria. At variance with Lubrol, LDAO changed the properties of the F0F1 ATPase. It made the enzyme oligomycin insensitive and froze it in an activated state. The activity was also 5-8-times stimulated in pea leaf mitochondria. Moreover, LDAO revealed an important ATP hydrolase activity when added to energized potato tuber mitochondria. Despite the specific effect of LDAO, the activity triggered by this detergent strongly depended on the energized state of the organelles before detergent addition. From this study, it is concluded that the electrochemical proton gradient is completely necessary to activate the F0F1-ATPase in intact plant mitochondria, as known in chloroplasts and suggested by some reports in animal mitochondria. Moreover, it is suggested that the main difference between the enzymes of pea leaf and potato tuber mitochondria is their rate of deactivation after the collapse of the transmembrane electrochemical potential difference. Finally, when properly used, detergents appear to be a powerful tool to probe the state of the ATPase in intact mitochondria, and maybe in more integrated systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biosyst\u00e8mes Membranaires, ERS 30, CNRS, Gif-sur-Yvette, France."}], "LastName": "Valerio", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Diolez", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Haraux", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0107600", "ISSNLinking": "0014-2956"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Detergents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3WJQ0SDW1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4F6FC4MI8W", "NameOfSubstance": "dodecyldimethylamine oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "52434-01-2", "NameOfSubstance": "lubrol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8L70Q75FXE", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.3.14", "NameOfSubstance": "Proton-Translocating ATPases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Detergents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proton-Translocating ATPases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solanum tuberosum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8397084", "10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18175.x"]}}]}
