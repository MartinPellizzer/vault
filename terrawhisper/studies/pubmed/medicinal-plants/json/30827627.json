In this study, the anti-neuroinflammatory and antioxidant phytochemicals of Chinese olive fruits were investigated. Three new phenylpropanoids (2, 6, 19), together with sixteen known congeners, have been isolated and identified. A variety of bioactivities related to the traditional healthy benefits of Chinese olive, including anti-neuroinflammatory, antioxidant and antidiabetic, have been evaluated for the identified compounds. The phenylpropanoids could significantly inhibit the production of nitric oxide induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in microglia cells (BV-2). Compounds 2, 6, and 19 could dose-dependently reduce the expression levels of pro-inflammatory mediator iNOS and COX-2 expressions induced by LPS in BV-2 cells. Meanwhile, some phenylpropanoids showed remarkable antioxidant and antidiabetic activities. This study suggested that Chinese olive could be served as a healthy product for neuroinflammatory related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
