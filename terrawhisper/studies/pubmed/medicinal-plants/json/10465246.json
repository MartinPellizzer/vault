He was taking Ma Huang (Herbalife) 1-3 tablets twice daily for 3 months along with other vitamin supplements, pravastatin, and furosemide. Physical examination revealed a male in mild respiratory distress. The lung fields had rales at both bases without audible wheezes. Internal jugular venous pulsations were 5 cm above the sternal notch. Medical therapy with intravenous furosemide and oral enalapril was initiated upon admission. Cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries, a dilated left ventricle, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34 mm Hg. The patient had right ventricular biopsy performed demonstrating mild myocyte hypertrophy and an infiltrate consisting predominantly of lymphocytes with eosinophils present in significantly increased numbers. Treatment for myocarditis was initiated with azothioprine 200 mg daily and prednisone 60 mg per day with a tapering course over 6 months. Anticoagulation with warfarin and diuretics was initiated and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition was continued. Hydralazine was added later. One month into therapy, an echocardiogram demonstrated improved left ventricular function with only mild global hypokinesis. A repeat right ventricular biopsy 2 months after the first admission showed no evidence of myocarditis. At 6 months, left ventricular ejection fraction was normal (EFN 50%) and the patient asymptomatic.", "Ephedra (Ma Huang) is the suspected cause of hypersensitivity myocarditis in this patient due to the temporal course of disease and its propensity to induce vasculitis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Rush Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zaacks", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klein", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "C D", "Initials": "CD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodriguez", "ForeName": "E R", "Initials": "ER"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leikin", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Clin Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8213460", "ISSNLinking": "0731-3810"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Food Additives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbalife"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sympathomimetics"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Toxicol Clin Toxicol. 2000;38(3):351.", "PMID": "10866340"}, {"RefSource": "J Toxicol Clin Toxicol. 2000;38(3):353-4.", "PMID": "10866341"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ephedra"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Food Additives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocarditis"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polypharmacy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sympathomimetics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10465246", "10.1081/clt-100102440"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
