Oriental medicine strives to complicate sets of prescriptions by using complex recipes and duplicating agents possessing identical effects. The absence of intolerability and side effects of these prescriptions may be given to account for their complexity far closer to the information contents of living bodies than modern scientific medicines which frequently apply substances synthesized or extracted from plants in pure form. Oriental remedial therapy is founded on the use of natural medicines of plant-, animal-, and mineral origin in the form of relatively large amounts of non-treated multi-component mixtures with a preferentially general effect on the organism. It involves the use of the underground parts of plants, aqueous extracts or ground medicinal raw materials. The absence of intensely active and poisonous plants and the scarcity of alkaloid-bearing plants explain the use of remedial mixtures in relatively large doses. Agents possessing antitoxic, anti-inflammatory and especially toning effects are most frequently used. Toning herbs should be given increased attention. A synthesis of traditional medicine and contemporary science on chemical composition and action of remedial plants and animals, and also on the effects that arise with applying complex prescriptions is essentially needed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brekhman", "ForeName": "I I", "Initials": "II"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grinevitch", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Am J Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7901431", "ISSNLinking": "0192-415X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Prescriptions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7053019", "10.1142/s0192415x81000263", "S0192415X81000263"]}}]}
