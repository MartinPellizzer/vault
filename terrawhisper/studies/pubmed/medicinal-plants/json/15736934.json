Since the functionality of the shikimate pathway is vital not only for plants but also for microorganisms, EPSPS is considered a prospective target for the development of novel antibiotics. We have kinetically analyzed and determined the crystal structures of Escherichia coli EPSPS inhibited by (R)- and (S)-configured phosphonate analogues of the tetrahedral reaction intermediate. Both diastereomers are competitive inhibitors with respect to the substrates of the EPSPS reaction, shikimate-3-phosphate (S3P) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Remarkably, the (S)-phosphonate (K(iS3P) = 750 nM), whose configuration corresponds to that of the genuine tetrahedral intermediate, is a much weaker inhibitor than the (R)-phosphonate analogue (K(iS3P) = 16 nM). The crystal structures of EPSPS liganded with the (S)- and (R)-phosphonates, at 1.5 and 1.9 A resolution, respectively, revealed that binding of the (R)-phosphonate induces conformational changes of the strictly conserved residues Arg124 and Glu341 within the active site. This appears to give rise to substantial structural alterations in the amino-terminal globular domain of the enzyme. By contrast, binding of the (S)-phosphonate renders the enzyme structure unchanged. Thus, EPSPS may facilitate the tight binding of structurally diverse ligands through conformational flexibility. Molecular docking calculations did not explain why the (R)-phosphonate is the better inhibitor. Therefore, we propose that the structural events during the open-closed transition of EPSPS are altered as a result of inhibitor action."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas 66045, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Priestman", "ForeName": "Melanie A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Healy", "ForeName": "Martha L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Becker", "ForeName": "Andreas", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alberg", "ForeName": "David G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bartlett", "ForeName": "Paul A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lushington", "ForeName": "Gerald H", "Initials": "GH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sch\u00f6nbrunn", "ForeName": "Ernst", "Initials": "E"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "PDB", "AccessionNumberList": ["1X8R", "1X8T"]}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P20 RR16443-01", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0370623", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2960"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Escherichia coli Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ligands"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organophosphonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkyl and Aryl Transferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.19", "NameOfSubstance": "3-Phosphoshikimate 1-Carboxyvinyltransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "3-Phosphoshikimate 1-Carboxyvinyltransferase"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Alkyl and Aryl Transferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallography, X-Ray"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ligands"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Organophosphonates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15736934", "10.1021/bi048198d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
