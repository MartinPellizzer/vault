The cranberry bean alpha-amylase inhibitor (CBAI) exhibited inhibitory effects on pancreatic alpha-amylases from the following mammals: pig, dog, cat, horse, sheep, cow, rabbit, guinea pig, rat, and mouse. CBAI showed a maximal inhibition at pH 5.5 against porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase (PPA). It was confirmed by gel filtration that a complex was formed in the 1:1 ratio between CBAI and PPA when they were incubated at 37 degrees C for 30 min at pH 5.5. A similar inhibition pattern was also observed at pH 6.9 that is optimal for the amylase reaction, but much higher concentrations of CABI were required to give 50% inhibition at pH 6.9 than at pH 5.5. Especially, both bovine and rat alpha-amylases were virtually unreactive to CBAI at pH 6.9."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Home Economics, Koka Women's Junior College, Kyoto, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kotaru", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yoshikawa", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ikeuchi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saito", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Iwami", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ibuki", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0402640", "ISSNLinking": "0301-4800"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Amylases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Pancreas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Amylases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3502137", "10.3177/jnsv.33.359"]}}]}
