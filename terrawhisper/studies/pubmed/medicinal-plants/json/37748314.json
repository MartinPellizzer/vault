Bioremediating polluted sites under environmental stresses like biotic and abiotic poses significant challenges. This study aimed to isolate a bacterium that effectively degrades pyrethroids even under abiotic stresses involving heavy metals and biotic stresses with autochthonous factors. Here, a bacterial strain, Bacillus cereus BCS1 was isolated. The response surface methodology was established to quantify the environmental impacts on pyrethroid degradation. BCS1 effectively degraded pyrethroids across conditions at 21-36\u00a0\u00b0C, pH 6.5-8.0 and inoculum sizes 1.9-4.1\u00a0mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, exceeding 90% degradation. Notably, over 84% of \u03b2-cypermethrin (\u03b2-CP) was degraded even when exposed to various concentrations of lead (10-1000\u00a0mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>), chromium (10-1000\u00a0mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>), or cadmium (0.5-50\u00a0mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>). Moreover, BCS1 significantly accelerated \u03b2-CP degradation in soil-plant systems, displaying biotic stress tolerance, with lower half-life values (10.1 and 9.5 d) in soil and higher removal (92.1% and 60.9%) in plants compared to controls (27.7 and 25.7 d), and (18.2% and 24.3%). This study presents a novel strain capable of efficiently degrading pyrethroids and displaying remarkable environmental stress resistance. Findings shed light on bioremediating organic pollutants in complex soil ecosystems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
