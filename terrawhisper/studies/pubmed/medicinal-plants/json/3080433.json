The molecular weight of P protein by gel filtration was 210,000, indicating that this enzyme has a native homodimer conformation. Reconstitution assays containing purified P, H, and T proteins and yeast lipoamide dehydrogenase catalyze the oxidation of glycine and demonstrate a strict dependence on pyridoxal phosphate, tetrahydrofolate, NAD+, and dithiothreitol. The released CO2, methylamine-H protein intermediate, and methylenetetrahydrofolate are produced in stoichiometric amounts from glycine during the cleavage reaction. H protein acts as co-substrate with glycine during the decarboxylation reaction, demonstrating an apparent Km value of 2.2 microM. P and H protein alone jointly catalyze the glycine carboxyl-14 CO2 exchange reaction in the presence of pyridoxal phosphate and dithiothreitol. L protein of the glycine cleavage system was immunopurified using monoclonal antibodies. Antigenic and molecular weight similarities of the L protein with the lipoamide dehydrogenase component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex were shown suggesting the possibility of common isomers of lipoamide dehydrogenase for the two enzyme complexes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Walker", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oliver", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicarbonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carrier Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycine Decarboxylase Complex H-Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Multienzyme Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "glycine cleavage system"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acid Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.4.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycine Dehydrogenase (Decarboxylating)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.8.1.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Dihydrolipoamide Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Transferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.2.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.2.10", "NameOfSubstance": "Aminomethyltransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TE7660XO1C", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aminomethyltransferase"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bicarbonates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Carrier Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dihydrolipoamide Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine Decarboxylase Complex H-Protein"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine Dehydrogenase (Decarboxylating)"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Multienzyme Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Transferases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "2", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3080433", "S0021-9258(17)35920-3"]}}]}
