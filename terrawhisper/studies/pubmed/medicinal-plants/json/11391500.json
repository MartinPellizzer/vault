Their traditional system of health care is based on the paj\u00e9, a witch doctor who uses plants and prayers for treatment.", "Field work was done in the Kamayura village holding successive interviews with the chief and the paj\u00e9 Takum\u00e1 to obtain information regarding the neurological disorders found there, the indigenous beliefs regarding illness (natural or based on witch-craft), their classification and traditional treatment based on plants. The terms employed were translated from Kamayura into Portuguese.", "Illness in Indians is caused by the revenge of the spirit (mama'e) of the animal killed by the huntsman. Epilepsy (Teawurup) or armadillo disease is caused when a huntsman kills an armadillo. It is treated with two roots, tsim\u00f3 and wewuru, kneaded, diluted in water and applied to the eyes. An infusion of enamum root is also used. Migraine or monkey disease causes a pulsatile headache and vertigo. Mental retardation and infantile cerebral palsy are included in the ant-bear disease. Depression is treated with the plant 'iputun\u00fa'; which is applied diluted in water to the face of the patient so that he no longer sees his dead relations and may be cured. Schizophrenia or apuayat (owl disease) also occurs, but not parkinsonism or stroke.", "The Kamayura pajes have established a system of health-care based on magic folklore, transmitted orally and making use of traditional plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Servicio de Neurolog\u00eda, Red Sarah de Hospitales del Aparato Locomotor, Hospital SARAH, Brasilia DF, Brasil. javier@bsb.sarah.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carod-Artal", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "V\u00e1zquez-Cabrera", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Antropolog\u00eda neurol\u00f3gica entre los indios Kamayur\u00e1 del Alto Xing\u00fa."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Spain", "MedlineTA": "Rev Neurol", "NlmUniqueID": "7706841", "ISSNLinking": "0210-0010"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anthropology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnicity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indians, South American"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Nervous System Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11391500"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
