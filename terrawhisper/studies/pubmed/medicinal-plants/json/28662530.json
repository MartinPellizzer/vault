These methods are intended to be complementary to current morphological and chemical methods of identification. The adoption of these methods by industry will be accelerated by the introduction of DNA-based identification techniques into regulatory standards and monographs. The introduction of DNA methods into the British Pharmacopoeia is described, along with a reference standard for use as a positive control for DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A general troubleshooting chart is provided to guide the user through the problems that may be encountered during this process. Nevertheless, the nature of the plant materials and the demands of industrial quality control procedures mean that conventional DNA barcoding is not the method of choice for industrial quality control. The design of DNA barcode-targeted quantitative PCR and high resolution melt curve tests is one strategy for developing rapid, robust, and reliable protocols for high-throughput screening of raw materials. The development of authentication tests for wild-harvested <i>Rhodiola rosea</i> L. is used as a case study to exemplify these relatively simple tests. By way of contrast, the application of next-generation sequencing to create a complete profile of all the biological entities in a mixed herbal drug is described and its potential for industrial quality assurance discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomolecular Technology Group, School of Allied Health Sciences, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK."}], "LastName": "Sgamma", "ForeName": "Tiziana", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BP-NIBSC Herbal Laboratory, National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls, Potters Bar, UK."}], "LastName": "Lockie-Williams", "ForeName": "Claire", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BP-NIBSC Herbal Laboratory, National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls, Potters Bar, UK."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, School of Biological Sciences, University of Reading, Reading, UK."}], "LastName": "Kreuzer", "ForeName": "Marco", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomolecular Technology Group, School of Allied Health Sciences, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK."}], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "Sarah", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals, Karlsruhe, Germany."}], "LastName": "Scheyhing", "ForeName": "Ulrike", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals, Karlsruhe, Germany."}], "LastName": "Koch", "ForeName": "Egon", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomolecular Technology Group, School of Allied Health Sciences, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK."}], "LastName": "Slater", "ForeName": "Adrian", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomolecular Technology Group, School of Allied Health Sciences, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BP-NIBSC Herbal Laboratory, National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls, Potters Bar, UK."}], "LastName": "Howard", "ForeName": "Caroline", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Planta Med. 2017 Dec;83(18):1430. doi: 10.1055/s-0043-120772", "PMID": "29017216"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computational Biology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "European Union"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis, DNA"}], "CoiStatement": "Conflict of Interest: Caroline Howard and Claire Lockie Williams are employed by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
