We investigated the levels of secondary metabolites in Heracleum including H.\u00a0persicum a valuable medicinal plant to depict the magnitude of cryptic variation and the potential significance of novel chemical traits. The essential oil volatiles from fruits of 34 populations from different species of Heracleum in Iranian distribution range and a native of H.\u00a0sphondylium and an invasive population of H.\u00a0persicum from Norway were analyzed with GC/MS. Out of 48 compounds identified, a contrasting pattern in the level of two major compounds, octyl acetate and hexyl butyrate was found among all studied species. Interestingly, a significant geographic pattern was observed; the hexyl butyrate/octyl acetate ratio was high (range 1.8\u00a0-\u00a03.2) in the northwestern Iranian populations of H.\u00a0persicum compared to that in northern and central populations (range 0.3\u00a0-\u00a00.9). Four populations from Zagros mountains also exhibited a unique composition. Anethole was found in two populations of H.\u00a0persicum from central Zagros, which has not been previously reported for essential oil of fruits of Heracleum so far. The results suggest high efficiency of large scale sampling from distribution range of species in identifying novel compounds. The unique pattern of geographic structuring also provides novel information to unravel cryptic variation in Heracleum."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, School of Biology, College of Science, University of Tehran, 14155-6455, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Falahati-Anbaran", "ForeName": "Mohsen", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agriculture Institute, Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology (IROST), 33535111, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammadi Bazargani", "ForeName": "Mitra", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, 7491, Trondheim, Norway."}], "LastName": "Rohloff", "ForeName": "Jens", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "92038838", "Agency": "Iran National Science Foundation", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biodivers", "NlmUniqueID": "101197449", "ISSNLinking": "1612-1872"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cluster Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Heracleum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Introduced Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Norway"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29906333", "10.1002/cbdv.201800230"]}}]}
