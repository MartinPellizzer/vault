Learning and memory were estimated by the avoidance rate (%) and/or latency (s). Acute administration of CYP 1.0 mg/kg i.p. 30 min prior to training produced a significant impairment in acquisition of 3 d learning and 48 h memory by decreasing the rate from 87.9 +/- 2.1, 75.8 +/- 4.9 in saline rats to 55.8 +/- 9.6, 53.4 +/- 8.4, respectively (F(1,14) = 10.7, 14.8, p < 0.01). The CYP administration immediately following the end of training and 30 min before testing produced the impairments in retention of 24 h memory and in retrieval of 48 h memory by decreasing the rate from 86.7 +/- 1.7, 93.3 +/- 2.7 to 55.0 +/- 5.5, 60.0 +/- 6.8, respectively (F(1,12) = 27.2, 10.5, p < 0.01). Repeated administration of GRg2 20 mg/kg i.p. significantly improved the CYP-induced recognitional deficits by increasing the CYP-decreased rate from 55.8 +/- 9.6 to 80.8 +/- 4.2 in d 3 learning acquisition (F(1,14) = 5.6, p < 0.05), from 53.4 +/- 8.4 to 60.0 +/- 8.2 in 48 h memory acquisition (F(1,14) = 7.5, p < 0.05) and from 55.0 +/- 5.5 to 88.3 +/- 2.5 in 24 h memory retention (F(1,12) 27.5, p < 0.01) as well as from 60.0 +/- 6.8 to 85.6 +/- 6.9 in 48 h memory retrieval (F(1,12) = 5.2, p < 0.05), respectively. The results also provide the suggestive evidence that central serotonin may play a positive modulatory role in the acquisition, retention and retrieval of two-way active avoidance responding in rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Shandong Medical University, The People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "T C", "Initials": "TC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Q H", "Initials": "QH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Arzneimittelforschung", "NlmUniqueID": "0372660", "ISSNLinking": "0004-4172"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2YHB6175DO", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyproheptadine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5R89LAS235", "NameOfSubstance": "ginsenoside Rg2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Avoidance Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyproheptadine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Memory"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mental Recall"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8267667"]}}]}
