However there has been little research on the communities' perception of oral cancer.", "This investigation was undertaken to assess the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of South Asian adults (n = 367) regarding the risk factors and signs for oral cancer.", "The information was obtained by means of a self-administered questionnaire and structured interviews at six Asian community centres and three general medical practices in north west London.", "Subjects ranged in age from 16 to 80 years and came from diverse socio-economic and cultural backgrounds.", "Tobacco use was the only risk factor correctly identified by most adults (82%). A significant difference (P < 0.001) was seen in betel-quid chewing habit among the age groups with 42.2% of adults in the 50-80 year age group practising this habit as compared to only 5.3% in the 16-29 year age group. Another finding was that the traditional method of betel-quid chewing is being replaced with readily available processed areca nut and tobacco products.", "There is extensive misinformation and a general lack of awareness about the risk factors and signs of oral cancer among the South Asian communities irrespective of age, gender, South Asian subgroup and social class. It is clear that betel-quid chewing is a common habit among the population and especially in the elderly population. It is recommended that health promotion advice be targeted to this population and their carers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Medicine and Pathology/WHO Collaborating Centre for Oral Cancer and Precancer, Guy's School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, GKT Dental Institute, London, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shetty", "ForeName": "K V", "Initials": "KV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "N W", "Initials": "NW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Community Dent Health", "NlmUniqueID": "8411261", "ISSNLinking": "0265-539X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Asia, Southeastern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chi-Square Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Ethnicity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Habits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Education"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interviews as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "London"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Social Class"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10665176"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
