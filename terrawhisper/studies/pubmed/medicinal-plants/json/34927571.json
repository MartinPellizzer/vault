Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a polyphenolic substance derived from various medicinal plants. Although CGA is reported to have potential anti-PD effect, the beneficial effect and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to further investigate the protective effect and clarify the mechanism of action of CGA in Caenorhabditis elegans (<i>C. elegans</i>) models of PD.", "Measurements of a-synuclein aggregation, movement disorders, and lipid, ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were observed in NL5901 nematodes. Determinations of dopamine (DA) neuron degeneration, food perception, and ROS content were performed in 6-OHDA-exposed BZ555 nematodes. The autophagy activation of CGA was monitored using DA2123 and BC12921 nematodes. Meanwhile, RNAi technology was employed to knockdown the autophagy-related genes and investigate whether the anti-PD effect of CGA was associated with autophagy induction in <i>C. elegans</i>.", "CGA significantly reduced \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, improved motor disorders, restored lipid content, and decreased ROS and MDA contents in NL5901 nematodes. Meanwhile, CGA inhibited DA neuron-degeneration and improved food-sensing behavior in 6-OHDA-exposed BZ555 nematodes. In addition, CGA increased the number of GFP::LGG-1 foci in DA2123 nematodes and degraded p62 protein in BC12921 nematodes. Meanwhile, CGA up-regulated the expression of autophagy-related genes in NL5901 nematodes. Moreover, the anti-PD effect of CGA was closely related to autophagy induction via increasing the expression of autophagy-related genes, including <i>unc-51</i>, <i>bec-1</i>, <i>vps-34</i>, and <i>lgg-1</i>.", "The present study indicates that CGA exerts neuroprotective effect in <i>C. elegans</i> via autophagy induction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
