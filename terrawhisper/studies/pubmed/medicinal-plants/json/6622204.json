For this purpose the Dutch Pharmacopoeia Ed. v introduced the Species antiaphthosae with Coleus leaves as an active component, because of their antiseptic qualities. Older research ascribed this activity to carvacrol and perhaps thymol. However, in more recent research in India eugenol and methyleugenol were also found to occur in this oil. Our investigations on original leaves from Java by GC-MS showed the absence of eugenol and methyleugenol, which leads us to the conclusion that on Java another chemotype occurs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bos", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hendriks", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "van Os", "ForeName": "F H", "Initials": "FH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Weekbl Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "7907992", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6555"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "J Chromatogr. 1963 Aug;11:463-71", "ArticleIdList": ["14062605"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "8", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6622204", "10.1007/BF01961467"]}}]}
