To determine their cholesterol-lowering effects, these two extracts were investigated by analyzing plasma lipid levels, intestinal enzyme activities, and the absorption of cholesteryl oleate. For 6 days, male rats were fed a diet containing cholesteryl oleate (0.5 g/100 g of body weight) either with or without the Areca nut extract supplements. The supplementation of the two Areca nut extracts significantly lowered the concentrations of plasma cholesterol by 13. 4 and 11.7% and plasma triglycerides by 35.0 and 36.9%, respectively, compared with the pre-experimental values. However, when the cholesteryl oleate diet was fed without any Areca nut extract in high-cholesterol control, the plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations significantly increased by 13.6 and 15.9%, respectively, compared with the pre-experimental values. After 6 days of treatment, the intestinal pCEase activities were significantly lower in the groups supplemented with the Areca nut extracts (37.8 and 26.5%) than in the group with no extract supplement (83.2%). The supplements also significantly elevated the excretion of [1,2(n)-(3)H]cholesteryl oleate administered orally, when determined by the large intestinal contents, 930.5 Bq/day (Areca I) and 1,766.3 Bq/day (Areca II) vs. 98.1 Bq/day (high-cholesteryl oleate (CO) control). The inhibition of pCEase activity with the supplementation of the Areca nut extracts could account for the decrease in [1,2(n)-(3)H]cholesteryl oleate absorption that resulted in decreased radioactivity in blood."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Nutrition, Kyungpook National University, Taegu, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jeon", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "T G", "Initials": "TG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ryu", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suh", "ForeName": "P G", "Initials": "PG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Byun", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Y B", "Initials": "YB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Ann Nutr Metab", "NlmUniqueID": "8105511", "ISSNLinking": "0250-6807"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol Esters"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3DPK9KFN2M", "NameOfSubstance": "cholesteryl oleate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Sterol Esterase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacokinetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol Esters"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Contents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Pancreas"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Sterol Esterase"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11111132", "10.1159/000012841", "12841"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
