Samen-ista emulsion is a new agent based on traditional medicine with coagulant properties. The efficacy and safety of Samen-ista were assessed in cutaneous and mucosal bleeding animal models. Coagulant properties of Samen-ista were evaluated using mice tail bleeding assay, marginal ear vein and upper gastrointestinal mucosal bleeding times in rabbits. After 7 days, clinical signs, mortality and end-organ (kidney, liver, lung, brain and gastric mucosa) histopathological changes were also examined. Samen-ista dose-dependently decreased mean cutaneous tail (128 vs. 14\u200as) and marginal ear vein (396 vs. 84\u200as) bleeding times. Rabbit's upper gastrointestinal bleeding time was also significantly decreased (214 vs. 15.8\u200as) upon Samen-ista local endoscopic application. Treatment with Samen-ista for 7 days did not cause any mortality, abnormal signs of bleeding, changes in appetite or significant histopathologicl changes. Samen-ista emulsion is well tolerated and highly effective in achieving hemostasis in cutaneous and mucosal bleeding animal models."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "aGastroenterology and Hepatology Department, Ghaem Hospital bDepartment of Pharmacology, School of Medicine cDepartment of Traditional Medicine, School of Traditional and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences dDepartment of Pathology, Research and Education Department, Razavi Hospital eCommunity Medicine Department, School of Medicine fDepartment of Occupational and Environmental Medicine gPharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Mousalreza", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pourakbar", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Forouzanfar", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Arian", "ForeName": "Amirali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ghaffarzadegan", "ForeName": "Kamran", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Salehi", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Esfandiari", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rakhshandeh", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis", "NlmUniqueID": "9102551", "ISSNLinking": "0957-5235"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Emulsions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Emulsions"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27388280", "10.1097/MBC.0000000000000482"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
