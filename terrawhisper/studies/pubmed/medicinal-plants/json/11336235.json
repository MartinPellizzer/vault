Pollination was followed by 2,4-D treatment, detached tiller culture, and embryo culture, as described for maize pollination. The frequency of embryo formation was similar to that obtained by crossing wheat with maize pollen. Job's tears is a perennial plant which forms several stalks and its pollen can be collected throughout the year when the plant is maintained in a controlled environment. Our results indicate that Job's tears can be used as the pollen parent for wheat crosses for haploid production without requiring synchronization of flowering dates."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Integrated Science and Kihara Institute for Biological Research, Yokohama City University, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mochida", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsujimoto", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Hered", "NlmUniqueID": "0375373", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1503"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crosses, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Haploidy"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11336235", "10.1093/jhered/92.1.81"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
