The HPLC separation was performed on a Kromasil C18 analytical column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm), and gradient elution was performed by mobile phase containing acetonitrile and water. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min and the detection wavelength was at 242 nm. The temperature of column was 25 degrees C.", "Sixteen mutual peaks were selected in chromatography. Among the obtained fingerprints, the most of the detected peaks were separated effectively. The methodological evaluation showed that the method had a good repeatability.", "The RSD of relative retention time of mutual peaks which existed in all samples was less than 1.1%. The results of peak areas were in accordance with the request of fingerprint. The established fingerprint can be used for the quality control and species identifying of PRAM."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Dongfeng Hospital, Yunyang Medical College, Shiyan 442008, China. cqh77@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qin-hua", "Initials": "QH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shu-yan", "Initials": "SY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19445118"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
