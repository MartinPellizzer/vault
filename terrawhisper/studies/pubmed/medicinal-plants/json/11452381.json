Large positive dichroisms were observed with three strains of TMV, namely ordinary, bean form of bean, and tomato strains (TMV-OM, TMV-B and TMV-T, respectively) at about 255, 276, 284 and 290 nm. The positive dichroisms were confirmed with reconstituted protein assemblies of TMV-OM and TMV-B at about 276, 284 and 290 nm where tyrosine and tryptophan residues of these proteins contribute. These results show that the electronic transition moments of their base groups and aromatic groups are nearly parallel to the polymer axis. It is suggested that there is a strong interaction between the base groups of RNA and aromatic groups of amino acid residues in TMV. 2. A small negative dichroism was observed near 296-300 nm with intact TMV-OM and TMV-T and with the reconstituted protein polymer of TMV-OM. But negative dichroism was not observed either with the intact virus or the protein assembly of TMV-B. 3. Isolated RNA from TMV-OM, TMV-B and TMV-T showed no dichroism. The configuration of RNA in TMV appears to be imposed on it by its packing with the protein."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Plant Pathology Laboratory, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan."}], "LastName": "Taniguchi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamaguchi", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Taniguchi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biochim Biophys Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0217513", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Circular Dichroism"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco Mosaic Virus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Viral Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1971", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1971", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11452381", "10.1016/0005-2795(71)90099-7", "0005-2795(71)90099-7"]}}]}
