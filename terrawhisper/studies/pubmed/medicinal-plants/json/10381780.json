Gingerol, a plant derivative, is known to produce similar effects when tested in isolated cardiac muscle. The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of gingerol and another plant derivative, ellagic acid, on the kinetics of the SR Ca2+ pump with those of PKA-catalyzed phospholamban phosphorylation to elucidate their mechanisms of Ca2+ pump regulation. As previously demonstrated for PKA, 50 microM gingerol or ellagic acid increased Vmax(Ca) of Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+-ATPase activity assayed at millimolar ATP concentrations in light cardiac SR vesicles. Unlike PKA, which decreases Km(Ca), neither compound had a significant effect on Km(Ca) in unphosphorylated vesicles. However, gingerol increased Km(Ca) in phosphorylated vesicles, in which Ca2+ uptake was significantly increased further at saturating Ca2+ and remained unchanged at subsaturating Ca2+. An inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by gingerol at micromolar MgATP concentrations was overcome with increasing MgATP concentrations. The stimulation of Ca2+ uptake attributable to gingerol in unphosphorylated microsomes at saturating Ca2+ was 30% to 40% when assayed at 0.05 to 2 mM MgATP and only about 12% in phosphorylated microsomes as well as in rabbit fast skeletal muscle light SR. The present results support the view that an ATP-dependent increase in Vmax(Ca) of the SR Ca2+ pump plays an important role in mediating cardiac contractile responses to gingerol and phospholamban-dependent beta-adrenergic stimulation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}], "LastName": "Antipenko", "ForeName": "A Y", "Initials": "AY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Spielman", "ForeName": "A I", "Initials": "AI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kirchberger", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "DE10754", "Acronym": "DE", "Agency": "NIDCR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL15764", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Pharmacol Exp Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "0376362", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3565"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Alcohols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19YRN3ZS9P", "NameOfSubstance": "Ellagic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "925QK2Z900", "NameOfSubstance": "gingerol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.11", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 7.2.2.10", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium-Transporting ATPases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium-Transporting ATPases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catechols"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ellagic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Alcohols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herb-Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Skeletal"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Sarcoplasmic Reticulum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10381780"]}}]}
