B. falcatum roots have been used in Chinese herbal formbulary for at least 2000 years (Ahmadimoghaddam et al. 2021). In June 2021, infected leaves of B. falcatum that had dark brown, circular, elliptical or irregular shaped lesions or severely withered were obtained in Yichang (30.75 \u00b0 N\uff0c111.24 \u00b0 E), Hubei, China. Disease incidence was approximately 40% in the 20 hm2 B. falcatum plantation base. Fifteen small pieces (3 mm) were cut from the junction between disease and health of surface sterilized (with 75% alcohol) leaves and then plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA). After 3 days incubation, eight isolates with the same colony morphology were sub-cultured and purified by hyphal tip isolation. Isolate CHYB1 cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) was selected for identification. The colony was initially white and later producing gray and brown. Pycnidia were dark, spherical or flat spherical, and 78.3 to 137.4 \u00b5m in diameter. Conidia were oval mostly, smooth, aseptate, and 18 the size was 3.7 to 5.1 \u00d7 1.6 to 2.5 \u00b5m. Following DNA extraction, PCR was performed using the TSINGKE 2\u00d7T5 Direct PCR Mix kit. Target areas of amplification were the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and beta-tubulin gene (TUB2) using ITS1/4 (White et al. 1990) Btu-F-F01/Btu-F-R01 primers (Wang et al. 2014), respectively. BLAST analysis of the ITS sequence (MZ818334.1) had 99% similarity to a 498 bp portion of D. glomerata sequence in GenBank (KR709012.1) and TUB2 sequence (OL439060) had 100% similarity to a 323 bp portion of D. glomerata sequence in GenBank (LT592974.1). All isolates (CHYB1-8) were taken for a pathogenicity test in laboratory on surface-disinfested leaves of B. falcatum. Mycelial plugs (5 mm) were excised from the margin of colony cultured for 5 days, and placed on surface-disinfested leaves of potted B. falcatum which involved creating small wounds. The potted plants were placed in a closed bucket to keep 80% relative humidity. Controls were inoculated with non-colonized PDA plugs (5 mm). All treatments had three replicates. On the inoculated B. falcatum, the leaves of B. falcatum appeared brown spot and been covered with off-white hyphae 7 DPI. By comparision, the control leaves had no symptoms. The pathogen was reisolated from the inoculated leaves and exhibited same morphological characteristics and ITS sequence as those of D. glomerata. D. glomerata was reported to cause round leaf spot on Sophora tonkinensis Gagnep and black spot disease of Actinidia chinensis in China (Pan et al. 2018; Song et al. 2020). To our knowledge, this is the first report of leaf spot caused by D. glomerata on B. falcatum in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Chinese Herbal Medicines , Enshi, Hubei , China; 1358487646@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Chinese Herbal Medicines, Enshi, China; wff164229@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Fanfan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Chinese Herbal Medicines, Enshi, United States; gjms91@sina.com."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Chinese Herbal Medicines, Enshi, HuBei, China; 119626192@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "XiaoLiang", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Chinese Herbal Medicines, 253 College Road, Enshi, Hubei Province, China, Enshi, China, 445000; 729456678@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Yuanyuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Chinese Herbal Medicines , NO.253,College Road, Enshi, HuBei, China, 445000; jingmaoyou@126.com."}], "LastName": "You", "ForeName": "Jingmao", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37622271", "10.1094/PDIS-02-23-0272-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
