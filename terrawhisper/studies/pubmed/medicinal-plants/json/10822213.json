They were asked a variety of questions about their background, attitudes and practices concerning herbal products.", "Thirty-eight per cent of the questionnaires were returned, with a total of 242 respondents. Fifty-four per cent of physicians discussed complementary therapies with their patients, whereas 100% of naturopaths discussed conventional medicines with their patients. The most popular product recommended by both medical doctors and naturopaths was echinacea, followed by St John's Wort. Eighty-six per cent of physicians, 74% of medical students, 66% of naturopaths and 50% of naturopathic students think that complementary medical education should be incorporated into the standard medical curriculum. Only one physician actually recommended a herbal product to a pregnant patient compared with 49% of the naturopaths who felt comfortable doing so.", "Complementary medicine has become a reality, and physicians are recommending herbal products to their patients, although on a smaller scale than are naturopaths. However, the two most popular herbal products are the same in each group. Physicians are less likely to recommend herbal products to pregnant and breastfeeding women than are naturopaths."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Motherisk Program, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. einarson@sickkids.on.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Einarson", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lawrimore", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brand", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gallo", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rotatone", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koren", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Clin Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9804162", "ISSNLinking": "1198-581X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Attitude of Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Breast Feeding"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Echinacea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Naturopathy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physicians"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Students, Medical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10822213"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
