Previous reviews have mentioned about green synthesis methods for nanoparticles and their biological activities. This review not only covers the general information about green synthesis of silver nanoparticles and characterization, but also focused on recent uses of various medicinal and nonmedical plants based AgNPs synthesis and their broad-spectrum antimicrobial and anticancer activities. In addition, this review emphasizes on elaborating underlying mechanism of anti-pathogenic microbial and anticancer activities of plant based AgNPs. Thus, present article provides a comprehensive analysis of plant-mediated synthesis of AgNPs and their potential applications in biomedical field including their mode of action and challenges in a single window."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Biotechnology , Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), Deemed to be University , Bhubaneswar , India."}], "LastName": "Hembram", "ForeName": "Krushna C", "Initials": "KC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Biotechnology , Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), Deemed to be University , Bhubaneswar , India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Rahul", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Biotechnology , Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), Deemed to be University , Bhubaneswar , India."}], "LastName": "Kandha", "ForeName": "Laxman", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b School of Chemical Technology & School of Biotechnology , Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), Deemed to be University , Bhubaneswar , India."}], "LastName": "Parhi", "ForeName": "Pankaj K", "Initials": "PK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Biotechnology , Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), Deemed to be University , Bhubaneswar , India."}], "LastName": "Kundu", "ForeName": "Chanakya N", "Initials": "CN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Biotechnology , Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), Deemed to be University , Bhubaneswar , India."}], "LastName": "Bindhani", "ForeName": "Birendra K", "Initials": "BK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101594777", "ISSNLinking": "2169-1401"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Green Chemistry Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30001158", "10.1080/21691401.2018.1489262"]}}]}
