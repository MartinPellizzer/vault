In addition, it has been identified that traditional phototherapy could trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) to activate antitumor immune response, which could not only effectively arrest primary tumour growth, but also exhibit superior effects in terms of anti-metastasis, anti-recurrence for metastatic melanoma treatment. However, the limited tumour accumulation of photosensitizers/photothermal agents and immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment severely weaken the immune effects. The application of nanotechnology facilitates a higher accumulation of photosensitizers/photothermal agents at the tumour site, which can thus improve the antitumor effects of photo-immunotherapy (PIT). In this review, we summarise the basic principles of nanotechnology-based PIT and highlight novel nanotechnologies that are expected to enhance the antitumor immune response for improved therapeutic efficacy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8091-4328"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of TCM Chemical Biology, Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Medicine Research, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ji-Yuan", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0003-8752-9563"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of TCM Chemical Biology, Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Medicine Research, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wei-Dong", "Initials": "WD"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2324-4908"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of TCM Chemical Biology, Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Medicine Research, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Jia-Yi", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5064-2843"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2393-7096"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of TCM Chemical Biology, Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Medicine Research, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Li-Jun", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0001-3343-7327"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of TCM Chemical Biology, Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Medicine Research, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Xin-Chen", "Initials": "XC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3674-256X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of TCM Chemical Biology, Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Medicine Research, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Luan", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3351-7124"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Jian-Qing", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7182-7166"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Drug Target", "NlmUniqueID": "9312476", "ISSNLinking": "1026-7158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosensitizing Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Photosensitizing Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Melanoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phototherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Microenvironment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "11"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37216425", "10.1080/1061186X.2023.2216402"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
