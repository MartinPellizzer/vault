The study was carried out by histological observations of ovarian follicles in an ovary-intact model and by histological observations of the endometrial epithelium in both OVX and ovary-intact female albino rats. Serial sections of the ovary and of the uterus were stained with routine hematoxylin-eosin and were observed under a microscope.", "In the ovary-intact model, CRE induced follicular recruitment, while it promoted follicular atresia at a later stage. Many of the graafian follicles in the treated ovary showed pyknosis of the nuclei of granulosa and theca cells, as well as disparity in granulosa cell organization. In the uterine tissues of both ovary-intact and OVX rats, CRE induced hyperplasia in places of luminal epithelium and degeneration of endometrial glands. In OVX rats, the effect of CRE on uterine endometrium was corroborative with the effect of E(2).", "Oral administration of the CRE of P. hydropiper significantly altered the histological structures of both ovary-intact and OVX rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Chaiduar College, Gohpur, Sonitpur Assam 784168, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hazarika", "ForeName": "Ajit", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sarma", "ForeName": "Hirendra N", "Initials": "HN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Contraception", "NlmUniqueID": "0234361", "ISSNLinking": "0010-7824"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4TI98Z838E", "NameOfSubstance": "Estradiol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Endometrial Hyperplasia"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Estradiol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Histocytochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ovarian Follicle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ovariectomy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Ovary"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polygonum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Uterus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17046386", "10.1016/j.contraception.2006.05.073", "S0010-7824(06)00252-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
