High field 1H- and 13C-nmr assignments were made for each compound and some of their derivatives by using one- and two-dimensional nmr techniques including nOe difference, COSY, and CH-correlation of one-bond and multiple bond (COLOC) relationships. A chemical correlation of the amphiacrolides to gutierolide [1], a compound with absolute stereochemistry determined by X-ray analysis, established the stereochemistry for the group. Consequently, a compound having reported properties identical with amphiacrolide D [5] must have its structure revised to contain the beta-faced epoxide. Amphiacrolide A [2] had not been reported previously."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210."}], "LastName": "Harraz", "ForeName": "F M", "Initials": "FM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Doskotch", "ForeName": "R W", "Initials": "RW"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "1S1ORR01458-01A1", "Acronym": "OR", "Agency": "ORS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Lactones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2292688", "10.1021/np50071a027"]}}]}
