The test protein sources, raw beans (RB) and extruded beans (EB), provided about 45% of the dietary protein. The diets were composed of 23.1% beans, 56.2% corn silage, 10.1% corn grain and 10.7% Italian rye-grass hay on a DM basis; the diets were isocaloric (4.5 Mcal/kg of DM) and isonitrogenous (14% of DM). Cr-EDTA, YbCl3 and purines were used as liquid, particulate and bacterial markers respectively. Extruding the beans did not influence intraruminal pH (6.6), ammonia-N (99 mg/l) and volatile fatty acids (97 mM/l) concentrations. Apparent digestibility in total tract of energy, OM, N and starch were not affected with inclusion of EB instead of RB, the corresponding mean values were: 66, 68, 64 and 95% of intake. Apparent ruminal digestion of OM, starch and N in the forestomach were 39, 58 and 52% for diets containing RB and 38, 72 and 45% for EB diets; efficiency of bacterial protein synthesis (gN/kg organic matter truly digested in the stomach) was higher for EN diets compared with RN diets (25 vs 22). Eating diets including EB increased non-ammonia-N, bacterial-N and dietary-N flows (g/d) to the duodenum compared with diets containing RB: 409 vs 366, 216 vs 194 and 193 vs 172 respectively; while starch flow was reduced (1.5 vs 2.2 kg/d) and OM flow was unchanged (9.8 kg/d). Apparent digestion from the small intestine (g/d) of nonammonia-N, bacterial-N and dietary-N were higher for EB diets: 268 vs 229, 181 vs 160 and 87 vs 69 respectively; meanwhile, starch digestion decreased (975 vs 1,612). The PDIA, PDIN and PDIE contents (g/kg of DM) of the RB were 33, 175 and 127 respectively; the corresponding values after extrusion were: 58, 147 and 178."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ENSAT, laboratoire d'ing\u00e9nierie agronomique, Toulouse, France."}], "LastName": "Benchaar", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vernay", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bayourthe", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Moncoulon", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Effet de l'extrusion de la f\u00e9verole (Vicia faba) sur les flux intestinaux d'azote et d'amidon chez la vache laiti\u00e8re en production."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Reprod Nutr Dev", "NlmUniqueID": "8913069", "ISSNLinking": "0926-5287"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intestine, Small"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lactation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1449610"]}}]}
