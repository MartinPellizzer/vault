Recent animal studies have indicated the benefits of fenugreek in RA and indicate that it may be a therapeutic candidate in RA; nonetheless, no systematic review is available about fenugreek and RA. This paper systematically reviewed the existing studies about fenugreek and RA and plausible mechanisms.", "Databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, and the search engine Google Scholar were searched until May 2022 and search alerts were used to receive studies issued after the primary search. There was no restriction in time and/or language. No human and <i>in vitro</i> research was detected; thus, animal investigations were considered. Also, the citations or references of studies were searched for potential studies. Book chapters, review papers, and grey literature (e.g. conference abstracts, dissertations, and patents) were not included.", "Finally, 11 studies were entered in this systematic review. Animal investigations showed that fenugreek had favorable effects in RA and could control this disease <i>via</i> attenuating inflammation, suppressing oxidative stress, and displaying anti-arthritic activity.", "Current review provides potent evidences about the efficacy of fenugreek in RA and elucidates the significance of more clinical investigations.
