Plant cell suspension culture is a method for the production of medicinal and secondary metabolites. The linalool is a plant secondary metabolite that has been recognized as a neuroprotective agent. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of salicylic acid elicitor on induction of linalool in cell suspension culture of cumin. For this purpose, the cumin seeds were prepared, to obtain sterile seedling, were disinfected with sodium hypochlorite and alcohol, and were cultured on MS basal medium. This research was conducted in two separate experiments including callus induction and suspension cultures. Leaf explants were prepared from sterile seedlings and used to produce callus on MS medium supplemented with 1 mg/l NAA and 0.5 mg/l BAP. In order to establish suspension culture, the appropriate calli were transferred to liquid medium. Then cell cultures were treated with elicitors. The effects of elicitor on the production of linalool secondary metabolite and cell viability were assessed by GC-Mass and tetrazolium test respectively. For this purpose, the salicylic acid (at concentrations of 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 mg/l) was used. The experimental design was a completely randomized design with five treatments and three replications. The results of cell culture and GC-Mass analysis showed that salicylic acid had significant effects on the linalool production (<0.01). At all concentrations of salicylic acid, viability of the cells in suspension culture experiments was lower than control. Increasing the elicitor concentrations lead to reduction in cell survival. In conclusion it is possible to produce linalool as a secondary metabolite and pharmaceutical agent in cell culture of cumin. It is necessary to determine the best combination of medium and elicitor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Higher Education, Jahad-e-Daneshgahi,\u00a0Kermanshah\u00a0Unit Department of Medicinal Plants Kermanshah Iran."}], "LastName": "Kazemi", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Razi University Agronomy and Plant Breeding Department Kermanshah Iran."}], "LastName": "Kahrizi", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences Medical Biology Research Center Kermanshah Iran."}], "LastName": "Mansouri", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences Department of Sexual Medicine, The Rhazes Center for Research in Family Health and Sexual Medicine Kermanshah Iran."}], "LastName": "Karim", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences Department of Sexual Medicine, The Rhazes Center for Research in Family Health and Sexual Medicine Kermanshah Iran."}], "LastName": "Vaziri", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences Department of Sexual Medicine, The Rhazes Center for Research in Family Health and Sexual Medicine Kermanshah Iran zargooshi@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Zargooshi", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Higher Education, Jahad-e-Daneshgahi,\u00a0Kermanshah\u00a0Unit Department of Medicinal Plants Kermanshah Iran."}], "LastName": "Khanahmadi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kermanshah-Based, General Department of Taxation Affairs Kermanshah Iran."}], "LastName": "Shokrinia", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kermanshah&mdash;Based, General Department of Taxation Affairs Kermanshah Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammadi", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Suspensions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D81QY6I88E", "NameOfSubstance": "linalool"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O414PZ4LPZ", "NameOfSubstance": "Salicylic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Cuminum"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolome"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Salicylic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Suspensions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27262805"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
