However, differences in the community and network structures between phyllosphere epiphytic and endophytic bacteria have rarely been investigated. Here, we examined phyllosphere epiphytic and endophytic bacterial communities of six mangrove species using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The results revealed that the community structure of epiphytic and endophytic bacteria was different. Plant identity significantly affected the diversity and community structure of both epiphytic and endophytic bacteria, with a greater effect on the community structure of the former than the latter. Network analysis showed that both plant-epiphytic and plant-endophytic bacterial network structures were characterized by significantly highly specialized and modular but lowly connected and anti-nested properties. Furthermore, the epiphytic bacterial network was more highly specialized and modular but less connected and more strongly anti-nested than the endophytic bacterial network. This study reveals that the phyllosphere epiphytic and endophytic bacterial community structures differ and plant identity has a greater effect on the epiphytic than on the endophytic bacteria, which may provide a comprehensive insight into the role of plant identity in driving the phyllosphere epiphytic and endophytic microbial community structures in mangrove ecosystems."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 FEMS 2020."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xiang", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xing-Chun", "Initials": "XC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Liang-Dong", "Initials": "LD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "FEMS Microbiol Ecol", "NlmUniqueID": "8901229", "ISSNLinking": "0168-6496"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodiversity"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wetlands"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32149339", "10.1093/femsec/fiaa038", "5800982"]}}]}
