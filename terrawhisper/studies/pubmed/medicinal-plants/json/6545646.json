Ten individuals participating in each study ingested levels of 0, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 g protein/kg/day at a constant energy level (45 kcal/kg/day), using the short-term nitrogen balance method with multiple intakes. Even with intakes of 105.7 and 117.4 mg N/kg/day for the cassava/bean and plantain/bean diets, the experimental subjects did not reach a positive balance. The protein digestibility of the diets was low, as had been confirmed previously for beans alone: 55.7% for the cassava/bean study and 50.4% for plantains/beans. The average quantity of nitrogen intake required to reach nitrogen equilibrium for the cassava/bean diet was 114.3 mg N/kg/day and for the plantain/bean diet, 111.9 mg N/kg/day. In the case of the cassava/bean diet, the variability was 81.3 to 172.4, and for plantain/beans, 83.6 to 219.3 mg/kg/day. In four of the five individuals who participated in both studies, the nitrogen intake required to reach nitrogen equilibrium was greater when fed the diet based on plantain/beans than when fed the cassava/beans diet. These data support the assertion that the protein requirement is not a simple figure. Individual variability is so great that, as has been suggested, it is necessary to add two standard deviations to the average figure to cover 97.5% of the population. The results of this investigation support the need to increase protein digestibility and protein quality of beans, since this is a food of major importance for large population segments in the developing countries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Navarrete", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guti\u00e9rrez", "ForeName": "O M", "Initials": "OM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bressani", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Digestibilidad, valor prote\u00ednico y necesidades de prote\u00edna de dietas a base de pl\u00e1tano/frijol y de yuca/frijol en j\u00f3venes adultos."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manihot"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritional Requirements"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6545646"]}}]}
