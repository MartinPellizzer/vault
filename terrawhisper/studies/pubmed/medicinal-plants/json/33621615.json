F. commonly known as Bhallathaka, is an important Ayurvedic medicinal plant of the family Anacardiaceae. Mature fruit of this plant is used as an Ayurvedic drug for treating various ailments including cancer. The drug has been reported to cause irritation, blisters, toxicity and contact dermatitis if used in raw form. In Ayurvedic texts, various methods have been described for purification process of Bhallathaka in order to minimize the toxic effects as well as to potentiate the drug. This study was carried out to evaluate chemical profiles and anti-cancer activity of raw and purified samples of Bhallathaka. Chemical characterization was done by Liquid chromatography mass spectroscopic (LC/MS) analysis and anticancer activity was evaluated using Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) model in mice with 5-fluorouracil as standard. The result indicated that purification of Bhallathaka imparted chemical changes to certain active compounds and enhanced its anti-cancer activity when compared to raw sample. The present study concluded that traditional purification process can impact the chemical and pharmacological profile of herbal drugs and thus beneficial in increasing its safety and efficacy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
