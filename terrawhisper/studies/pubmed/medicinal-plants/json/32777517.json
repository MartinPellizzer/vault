However, limited studies have been done to identify these medicinal plant species and to scientifically document their associated traditional knowledge. Many species used by indigenous people could potentially represent a novel resource of medicine. The study can aid in further investigations of modern pharmacology and planning of the wild species conservation.", "The study aimed to investigate and record the medicinal plant taxa and their associated traditional knowledge in Gaomi City, China.", "Field study was conducted from March 2018 to May 2019 with 184 residents of Gaomi City. Traditional medicinal plant specimens were collected from the field with the help of these residents and were identified and authenticated in the Herbarium of the School of Pharmacy, Binzhou Medical University. Ethnobotanical knowledge was collected by semi-structured face-to-face interviews. The quantitative data were analyzed by using the informant consensus factor (ICF) method and the number of citations.", "A total of 181 species belonging to 137 genera and 65 families were collected in Gaomi City. Asteraceae was the predominant family and Fabaceae took the second place. River basins and the southern hills in Gaomi were rich in vegetation. However, the cultivated area of medicinal plants only accounted for 10% of agricultural acreage. The main preparation method was decocting (170, 94.48%) and the most frequent mode of administration was oral (177, 97.97%). The highest numerical ICF value was recorded for treating endocrine, metabolic, and nutritional (ICF: 0.85) conditions. Seven of the medicinal plant species used by the people in Gaomi have not been reported previously in China. Verbena officinalis L. was found in Gaomi City, which is a new distribution record for this species.", "People in Gaomi hold valuable knowledge about the use of medicinal plants; however, their knowledge has not been comprehensively documented. The therapeutic uses of the documented medicinal plants will provide a basis for further pharmacological and phytochemical investigations. Additionally, the result of this study indicated that the elder people in Gaomi have more traditional knowledge of plant medicines than the younger ones."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
