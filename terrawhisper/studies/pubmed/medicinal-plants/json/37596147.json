MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small endogenous noncoding RNAs that play a critical regulatory role in cancer development and progression, including in BC. MiRNA deficiency promotes the development of BCs. MiR-143-5p is one of the most commonly dysregulated miRNAs in BC but its role as a tumor suppressor remains unclear.", "MiR-143-3p and -5p expression in breast tissue was analyzed using TCGA and StarBase databases. Expression in BC subclasses and survival analyses were conducted. Clinical samples were collected, cell cultures created, and gene expression assays performed following previous studies. Protein expression, luciferase reporter, wound healing, DAPI staining, cell cycle, colony formation, spheroid, CD44 FACS, and proliferation assays were conducted following various protocols.", "Here, we find that both miR-143-3p and miR-143-5p levels are considerably lower in BC tissue compared to normal breast tissue and low miR-143 expression predicts poor prognosis in ER+ BC patients. In-depth analyses identified 3 miR-143-5p binding sites in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the DNA binding protein High Mobility Group AT-Hook 2 (HMGA2). Luciferase reporter assays using wild-type and mutant HMGA2 3'UTR sequences and Western blot analyses demonstrated that HMGA2 is a direct and bona fide miR-143-5p target in BC cells. In addition, we show that restoration of miR-143-5p expression suppresses metastasis-related features of ER+ BC cells, including reduced tumor cell migration, increased E-cadherin expression, and decreased vimentin and N-cadherin expression. Furthermore, miR-143-5p reduces cell proliferation, cell cycle entry, and stemness, while promoting apoptosis moderately. Finally, patient sample pathway analyses demonstrated that these mechanisms are also active in BC.", "Altogether, our findings shed new light on miR-143-5p's anticancer biological functions in BC progression by directly targeting HMGA2. This suggests that restoration of miR-143-5p could be a promising new therapeutic approach for the treatment of ER+ BC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
