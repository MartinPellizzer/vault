The content of iron (III) in APC was determined with iodometry. The stability of APC under physiological pH conditions was judged by titrating APC with sodium hydroxide. The deoxidization of APC was tested with colorimetric analysis.", "APC showed the qualitatively identified reactions of iron (III). The content of iron (III) in APC ranged from 10% to 40%, and the water-solubility of APC was related to the content of iron (III). The complex was stable at physiological pH from 3 to 12, without precipitation and dissociation. At 37 degrees C, Fe (III) in the complex was completely reduced to Fe (III) by ascorbic acid in about 6 hours.", "APC can be qualitatively identified by using the qualitatively identified reactions of iron (III). When its iron (III) content is within 20%-25%, APC has a better ability to dissolve in water. And the complex is stable under physiological pH conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. wkpzcq@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Kai-ping", "Initials": "KP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Li-quan", "Initials": "LQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Angelica sinensis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Physical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemical synthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17048684"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
