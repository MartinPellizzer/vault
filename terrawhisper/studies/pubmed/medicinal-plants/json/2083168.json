Forty volunteers, aged 70 years and over, took 600 mg of garlic powder per day for three months. In participants with initially normal plasma cholesterol levels (CH less than 200 mg/dl; n = 11) after three months of garlic tablet administration, little or no change in CH values was registered, as for most of the other parameters. In contrast, in volunteers with initially elevated CH levels (CH greater than 200 mg/dl, n = 29), the CH levels were reduced by -7.7% (p less than 0.001). This reduction took place primarily in the esterified cholesterol fraction (-12%, p less than 0.001), whereas free cholesterol concentrations were not altered significantly. Triglycerides (-15.9%, p less than 0.05) and plasma choline phospholipids (-4.6%, p less than 0.01) were also reduced. No change of the plasma LDL-CH to HDL-CH ratio was observed in this group. Based on the weight of lyophilised, haemoglobin-free erythrocytes, the mean membrane concentration of phospholipids and cholesterol in the total cohort (n = 40) increased by 5.7% (p less than 0.001) and 6.1% (p less than 0.01), respectively. These increases were more pronounced the lower the body mass indices (kg/m2) were, and the longer the duration of garlic administration was. The molar ratio of membrane phospholipids to cholesterol remained unchanged. The results are discussed with regard to a possible role of the garlic-induced membrane effects in the plasma lipid-lowering potency of garlic and preparations made from it."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair of Internal Medicine-Gerontology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, West Germany."}], "LastName": "Brosche", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Platt", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dorner", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Clin Pract Suppl", "NlmUniqueID": "8007786", "ISSNLinking": "0262-8767"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Mass Index"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperlipoproteinemias"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2083168"]}}]}
