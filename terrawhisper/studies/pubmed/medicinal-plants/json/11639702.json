The results were as follows: 1) Valerianae radix was the vegetable drugs originally produced in Europe. The government always studied the vegetable drugs produced in Japan, as the substitute to one produced in Europe. The government provided the drugs newly produced in Japan for valerianae radix in JP II (1891). The study gave a good result to the market when World War I began. That is to say, Japanese valerianae transferred to the true position from the substitute in JP IV (1920). 2) The test-methods of judgment for valerianae radix were based on the form between JP I and JP V mainly. The technical level of judgment was equal to USP and BP. The methods were the standard of judgment for the vegetable drugs to maintain quality in those days."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Japanese Society of History of Pharmacy."}], "LastName": "Yanagisawa", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakushigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "1267223", "ISSNLinking": "0285-2314"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Psychotropic Drugs"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacopoeias as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Psychotropic Drugs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Valerian"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11639702"]}}]}
