All synthesized compounds exhibited good inhibitory activity against yeast \u03b1-glucosidase (IC<sub>50</sub> values in the range of 181.0-474.5\u202f\u00b5M) even much more potent than standard drug acarbose (IC<sub>50</sub>\u202f=\u202f750.0). Among them, quinazolinone-1,2,3-triazoles possessing 4-bromobenzyl moiety connected to 1,2,3-triazole ring (10g and 10p) demonstrated the most potent inhibitory activity towards \u03b1-glucosidase. Compound 10g inhibited \u03b1-glucosidase in a competitive manner with K<sub>i</sub> value of 117\u202f\u00b5M. Furthermore, the binding modes of the most potent compounds 10g and 10p in the \u03b1-glucosidase active site was studied through in silico docking studies. Also, lack of cytotoxicity of compounds 10g and 10p was confirmed via MTT assay."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
