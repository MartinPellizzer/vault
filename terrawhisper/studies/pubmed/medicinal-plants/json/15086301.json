The condition has been associated with the ingestion of anthracene laxatives and is believed to be caused by increased epithelial apoptosis. Although melanosis coli is a frequent finding in colonic biopsies and resection specimens, to our knowledge the presence of identical pigment in macrophages of pericolonic lymph nodes has been reported in only 4 other patients in the English literature. We report the case of a patient who underwent a left hemicolectomy for colonic adenocarcinoma and was found incidentally to have melanosis coli associated with long-term use of the herbal laxative Swiss Kriss, not only in his colonic mucosa, but also in the colonic submucosa and in his pericolonic lymph nodes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC 20007, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ewing", "ForeName": "C Alexander", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kalan", "ForeName": "Mohammed", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chucker", "ForeName": "Francis", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozdemirli", "ForeName": "Metin", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Pathol Lab Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7607091", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9985"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cathartics"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Adenocarcinoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cathartics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colon"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Colonic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lymph Nodes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "complications", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Melanosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15086301", "10.5858/2004-128-565-MCIPLN", "CR3107"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
