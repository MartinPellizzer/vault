The Internet provides an innovative way of educating busy health professionals. This study assessed the impact of an Internet-based curriculum on health professionals' knowledge, confidence, and clinical practices related to herbs and dietary supplements.", "The study was a randomized crossover trial involving physicians, pharmacists, advanced practice nurses, and dietitians. Participants were invited by e-mail and randomly assigned to immediate intervention versus waiting-list groups (n = 537). The curriculum lasted ten weeks and consisted of 20 case-based modules, each involving one multiple-choice or true-or-false question and its answer, links to reliable Internet sources of additional information, and a moderated listserv discussion group. Participants were surveyed about their knowledge, confidence, and communication related to herbs and dietary supplements on enrollment, after the immediate intervention group had completed the curriculum, and after the waiting-list group completed the curriculum.", "Baseline scores for knowledge, confidence, and communication were similar in the two groups. At the first follow-up, there was greater improvement in scores for all three areas in the immediate intervention group than in the waiting-list group (improvement for knowledge, 3.0 versus 1.4; confidence, 2.6 versus 0.6; communication, 0.21 versus -0.1, p <.01 for all comparisons). After all participants had received the curriculum, scores for both groups were significantly better than at baseline and similar to one another.", "Internet-based education about herbs and dietary supplements for diverse health professionals is feasible and results in significant and sustained improvements in knowledge, confidence, and communication practices."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pediatrics, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Brenner's Children's Hospital, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kemper", "ForeName": "Kathi J", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amata-Kynvi", "ForeName": "Andey", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sanghavi", "ForeName": "Darshak", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Whelan", "ForeName": "Julia S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dvorkin", "ForeName": "Lana", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Woolf", "ForeName": "Alan", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Samuels", "ForeName": "Ronald C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hibberd", "ForeName": "Patricia", "Initials": "P"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "1R21 AT00213", "Acronym": "AT", "Agency": "NCCIH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acad Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8904605", "ISSNLinking": "1040-2446"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Attitude of Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Competence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Curriculum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["organization & administration"], "DescriptorName": "Education, Distance"}, {"QualifierName": ["organization & administration"], "DescriptorName": "Education, Medical, Continuing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Educational Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feasibility Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["education"], "DescriptorName": "Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Internet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Practice Patterns, Physicians'"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Program Evaluation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12228083", "10.1097/00001888-200209000-00014"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
