After 7 days of culture, attached cells were stimulated with Ginkgo biloba extract (10, 25 and 50 mg x L(-1)) or vehicle control for the respective time points (6, 12, 24 and 48 h). EPC were characterized as adherent cells double positive for DiLDL-uptake and lectin binding by direct fluorescent staining under a laser scanning confocal microscope. EPC were further documented by demonstrating the expression of CD34, VEGFR-2 and AC133 with flow cytometry. EPC proliferation, migration and in vitro vasculogenesis activity were assayed with MTT assay, modified Boyden chamber assay and in vitro vasculogenesis kit, respectively. EPCs adhesion assay was performed by replating MNCs on fibronectin-coated dishes, and then counting adherent cells.", "Incubation of isolated human MNCs with Ginkgo biloba extract increased the number of EPC, maximum at 25 mg x L(-1), 24 hours (approximately 1-fold increase, P < 0.01).
