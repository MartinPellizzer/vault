Edible mushrooms can efficiently concentrate some elements in flesh but little is known on highly toxic alpha- and beta emitters. In this study, the absolute values of radioactivity (Bq\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup> dry weight) for <sup>210</sup>Po were in the range 2.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0 to 308\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 in fresh species and 22.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 to 142\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 in a ready to eat meals, and for <sup>210</sup>Pb were 3.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 to 51.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9 and 3.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14 to 9.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5, respectively. The studied batches of a corresponding species of mushrooms - raw and cooked - were not equivalent regarding the homogeneity of the composition. However the raw mushrooms (ingredient for any cooking), showed greater radioactivity in relation to stir-fried meals, and that can imply on a partial loss of nuclides. A daily portion of 100\u00a0g of stir-fried mushrooms could provide <sup>210</sup>Po and <sup>210</sup>Pb radiation in the range 0.2-2.1\u00a0\u03bcSv and 0.02-0.06\u00a0\u03bcSv, respectively. Assessed, the cumulative doses of exposure to <sup>210</sup>Po were 1.4-14\u00a0\u03bcSv in a week period and 75-722\u00a0\u03bcSv at annual timescale, and of <sup>210</sup>Pb amounted at 0.15-0.46\u00a0\u03bcSv and 8.3-24\u00a0\u03bcSv, respectively. The <sup>210</sup>Po can be possibly considered as a major source of ionizing radiation activity for persons with high mushroom meals consumption in SW Asia, while the number of available data is limited."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
