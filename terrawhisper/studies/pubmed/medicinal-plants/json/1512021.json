Alcoholic extract of the root of the plant was injected(ip) at daily doses of 200 to 1000 mg/kg body wt for 15 days starting from 24 hr after intradermal inoculation of 5 x 10(5) cells of S-180 in BALB/c mice. Solid tumor growth was monitored for 100 days. Doses of 400 mg/kg and above produced complete regression of tumor after an initial growth, the percentage of complete response (CR) increasing with increasing drug dose. A 55% CR was obtained at 1000 mg/kg drug administration, but this dose also produced some mortality among the animals. A significant increase in the volume doubling time and growth delay was seen when the drug dose was increased from 500 to 750 mg/kg body wt, but further increase in drug dose to 1000 mg/kg did not produce any significant increase in these responses. Cumulative doses of 7.5 to 10 g at daily doses of 500 or 750 mg/kg seems to produce a good response in this tumor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiobiology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, India."}], "LastName": "Devi", "ForeName": "P U", "Initials": "PU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sharada", "ForeName": "A C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Solomon", "ForeName": "F E", "Initials": "FE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kamath", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Transplantation"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Remission Induction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Sarcoma 180"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1512021"]}}]}
