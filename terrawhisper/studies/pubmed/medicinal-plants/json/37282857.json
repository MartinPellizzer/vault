According to synthetic biology and by constructing biomimetic microbial cells and imitating the synthesis of active ingredients in medicinal plants and animals, the key enzymes obtained from medicinal plants and animals are scientifically designed and systematically reconstructed and optimized to realize the heterologous synthesis of the active ingredients in microorganisms. This method ensures an efficient and green acquisition of target products, and also achieves large-scale industrial production, which is conducive to the production of scarce TCM resources. Additiona-lly, the method playes a role in agricultural industrialization, and provides a new option for promoting the green and sustainable deve-lopment of TCM resources. This review systematically summarized the important progress in the heterologous biomimetic synthesis of TCM active ingredients from three research areas: biosynthesis of terpenoids, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, alkaloids and other active ingredients, key points and difficulties in heterologous biomimetic synthesis, and biomimetic cells with complex TCM ingredients. This study facilitated the application of new generation of biotechnology and theory to the development of TCM."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences Tianjin 300308, China University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences Tianjin 300308, China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Zhu-Bo", "Initials": "ZB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomimetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37282857", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20230308.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
