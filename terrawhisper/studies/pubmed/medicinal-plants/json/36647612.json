SARS-CoV-2 3CL<sup>Pro</sup> is one of the most intriguing biomolecular targets among scientists worldwide for developing antiviral drugs due to its relevance in viral replication and transcription. Herein, we utilized computer-assisted drug screening to investigate 326 natural products from Thai traditional plants using structure-based virtual screening against SARS-CoV-2 3CL<sup>Pro</sup>. Following the virtual screening, the top 15 compounds based on binding energy and their interactions with key amino acid Cys145 were obtained. Subsequently, they were further evaluated for protein-ligand complex stability <i>via</i> molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy calculation using molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) approaches. Following drug-likeness and ADME/Tox assessments, seven bisbenzylisoquinolines were obtained, including neferine (<b>3</b>), liensinine (<b>4</b>), isoliensinine (<b>5</b>), dinklacorine (<b>8</b>), tiliacorinine (<b>13</b>), 2'-nortiliacorinine (<b>14</b>), and yanangcorinine (<b>15</b>). These compounds computationally showed a higher binding affinity than native N3 and GC-373 inhibitors and attained stable interactions on the active site of 3CL<sup>pro</sup> during 100 ns in molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Moreover, the <i>in vitro</i> enzymatic assay showed that most bisbenzylisoquinolines could experimentally inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL<sup>Pro</sup>. To our delight, isoliensinine (<b>5</b>) isolated from <i>Nelumbo nucifera</i> demonstrated the highest inhibition of protease activity with the IC<sub>50</sub> value of 29.93 \u03bcM with low toxicity on Vero cells. Our findings suggested that bisbenzylisoquinoline scaffolds could be potentially used as an <i>in vivo</i> model for the development of effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs."]}, "AuthorList":
