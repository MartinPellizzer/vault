Guar gum (GG) is a natural polymer with great potential to be used in pharmaceutical formulations due to its unique composition and lack of toxicity. GG can be designed to suit the needs of the biological and medical engineering sectors. In the development of innovative drug delivery systems, GG is commonly utilized as a rate-controlling excipient. In this review, different properties of GG including chemical composition, extraction methods and its usefulness in diabetes, cholesterol lowering, weight control, tablet formulations as well as its food application were discussed. The other purpose of this study is to evaluate potential use of GG and its derivatives for advanced nanomedicine such as drug delivery, tissue engineering and nanosensing. It should be noted that some applicable patents in medical area have also been included in the rest of this survey to extend knowledge about guar gum and its polymeric nature."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
