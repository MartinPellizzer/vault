Lappadilactone (1), dehydrocostuslactone (2), and costunolide (5) exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity with CD50 values in the range 1.6-3.5 microg/mL in dose- and time-dependent manners. The cytotoxicities were not specific and showed similar activities against HepG2, OVCAR-3 and HeLa cell lines. The structure-activity relationship showed that the alpha-methylene-gamma-lactone moiety is necessary for cytotoxicity, and activity is reduced with the presence of a hydroxyl group. In addition, seven noncytotoxic compounds (9-15) were also isolated, including two novel sesquiterpenes, a guaianolide-type with a C17 skeleton, lappalone (13), and 1beta,6alpha-dihydroxycostic acid ethyl ester (14). The structures of the new compounds were elucidated from spectroscopic and/or X-ray data interpretations. Some representative compounds were also tested for antibacterial activity; however, only marginal activities were observed. Therefore, compounds 1-8 are potential cytotoxic agents but without significant antibacterial effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China. cmsun@nricm.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Chang-Ming", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Syu", "ForeName": "Wan-Jr", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Don", "ForeName": "Ming-Jaw", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Jang-Jih", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Gum-Hee", "Initials": "GH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "lappadilactone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallography, X-Ray"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ovarian Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Saussurea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14510592", "10.1021/np030147e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
