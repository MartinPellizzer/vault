Traditional medicines are often more sustainable, but issues related to source consistency and efficacy present challenges. Modern medicine has focused solely on purified molecules, but evidence is mounting to support some of the more traditional uses of medicinal biologics. When is a more traditional delivery of a therapeutic appropriate and warranted? What studies are required to establish validity of a traditional medicine approach? <i>Artemisia annua</i> and <i>A. afra</i> are two related but unique medicinal plant species with long histories of ethnopharmacological use. <i>A. annua</i> produces the sesquiterpene lactone antimalarial drug, artemisinin, while <i>A. afra</i> produces at most, trace amounts of the compound. Both species also have an increasing repertoire of modern scientific and pharmacological data that make them ideal candidates for a case study. Here accumulated recent data on <i>A. annua</i> and <i>A. afra</i> are reviewed as a basis for establishing a decision tree for querying their therapeutic use, as well as that of other medicinal plant species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5138-3839"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Biotechnology, 100 Institute Rd, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, 01609, USA. weathers@wpi.edu."}], "LastName": "Weathers", "ForeName": "Pamela J", "Initials": "PJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R15 AT008277", "Acronym": "AT", "Agency": "NCCIH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "8502408", "ISSNLinking": "0265-0568"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9RMU91N5K2", "NameOfSubstance": "artemisinin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Artemisinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimalarials"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisinins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimalarials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia annua"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36541391", "10.1039/d2np00072e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
