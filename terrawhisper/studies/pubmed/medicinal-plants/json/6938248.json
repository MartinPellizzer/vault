(cv. Trapper) inoculated with a single strain of Rhizobium leguminosarum. The detached nodules were triturated under helium flow. The resultant breis could support C2H2 reduction in N-Tris[hydroxymethyl]methyl-2-aminoethane-sulfonic acid buffer (Tes) without any additions for over an hour. NH4+ was found to inhibit C2H2 reduction and H2 evolution. The inhibition was not dependent on the counterion and was evident immediately after the addition of NH4+ to the reaction mixture. L-Methionine-D,L-sulfoximine, added to inhibit assimilation of NH4+, had no effect on the inhibition. Addition of pyruvate enhanced the rate of C2H2 reduction in breis and partially overcame the inhibition of NH4+. Pyruvate was found necessary for measurable activity in bacteroid preparations. When ATP and an ATP-generating system were used in breis the effect of NH4+ was not observed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Salminen", "ForeName": "S O", "Initials": "SO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biochim Biophys Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0217513", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "01Q9PC255D", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7YNJ3PO35Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8L70Q75FXE", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.18.6.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OC7TV75O83", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylene"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "3", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6938248", "10.1016/0005-2744(81)90243-6", "0005-2744(81)90243-6"]}}]}
