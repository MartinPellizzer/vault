Pathological features including interstitial inflammation, interstitial fibrosis, bleeding, and emphysema as well as tracheal responsiveness to methacholine and OVA, were significantly decreased in treated groups with dexamethasone and all concentrations of curcumin compared to group A (p<0.05 to p<0.001).
