The hearts from control rats (no-HBO and no-HBO-PG), and from rats exposed to HBO and to HBO after PG treatment were isolated and subjected to mild ischemia and then reperfused. HBO greatly worsens the post-ischemic damage in controls, as demonstrated by the rise of left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and coronary perfusion pressure (CPP). PG significantly restrained the increase of LVEDP and CPP in respect to HBO-untreated rats, as well as that of CPP induced by injection of angiotensin II during pre-ischemia. In HBO control rats the reduction of the vasorelaxant effect of acetylcholine on norepinephrine precontracted aortic rings, was markedly recovered by PG; a similar trend was observed in aortic rings challenged with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (56% recovery). These results strongly indicate that PG prevents the myocardial ischemia/reperfusion damage and the impairment of endothelial functionality induced by reactive oxygen species arising from HBO exposure, through an antioxidant intervention. The in vitro radical scavenging activity of PG seems to be too weak (0.05-0.5 mg/ml) to explain by itself the cardiac and extra-cardiac protective effects, and this suggests a role also for an indirect antioxidant action of the drug (endothelial nitric oxide synthase stimulation)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Istituto Chimico Farmaceutico Tossicologico, University of Milan, Italy.
