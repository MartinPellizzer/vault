The system was optimized for the detection of the garlic aroma volatile, diallyl disulfide, from water. Parameters investigated included interface temperature, flow rate through the fiber, flow rate through the sample vessel, and sample stir rate. The delay time for detection of sample after introduction into the sample vessel was determined as 43 s. The system proved to be reliable and robust with no loss in sensitivity or contamination of the mass spectrometer over a 6 month period. The technique was applied to a homologous series of aliphatic alcohols from C(2) to C(7). Results showed that as polarity decreased with increasing chain length the release of volatile into the headspace was faster and gave a higher maximum intensity. Release of the garlic aroma volatile from different commercial mayonnaise products clearly showed a decrease in the release of diallyl disulfide as fat content increased. These results demonstrate the potential of using this technique as a tool for understanding the complex interactions that occur between flavor compounds and the bulk food matrix."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Food Research, Reading Laboratory, Earley Gate, Reading, Berkshire RG6 6BZ, United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Springett", "ForeName": "M B", "Initials": "MB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rozier", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bakker", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alcohols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60G7CF7CWZ", "NameOfSubstance": "allyl sulfide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10552426", "10.1021/jf980199n", "jf980199n"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
