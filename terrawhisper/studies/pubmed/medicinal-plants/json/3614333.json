The extraction with 70-75% saturated solutions permits to obtain directly a chromatographic and electrophoretic homogeneous preparation of MSP. The extract obtained with 65% saturated solution contains small quantity of contaminants. One-step DEAE-cellulose chromatography was found to be sufficient for their complete removal. On PAGE the MSP gives one wide, diffuse band with a relative mobility to bromphenol blue of Rm 0.38-0.42, and one additional band with Rm 0.18-0.20. The latter corresponds to tetrameric form of MSP. Reversible pH-dependent protomer-tetramer association was demonstrated by sedimentation velocity behaviour. At pH 7.2 the MSP gives one peak for 7S protomeric form. Below pH 7.0 a second peak for 18S tetrameric appears. SDS-PAGE analysis of subunit pattern shows the existence of 3 main components with molecular weights 53,000, 49,000 and 46,000. Some minor, lower MW polypeptides are also found. It seems that they are products of further dissociation of the main subunits."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dukiandjiev", "ForeName": "S V", "Initials": "SV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Nahrung", "NlmUniqueID": "0142530", "ISSNLinking": "0027-769X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SU46BAM238", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonium Sulfate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ammonium Sulfate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Densitometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultracentrifugation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3614333", "10.1002/food.19870310311"]}}]}
