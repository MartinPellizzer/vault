However, the active components of WL and the mechanisms by which these compounds affect DM are unclear.", "This study aimed to determine these effective ingredients and elucidate the potential mechanisms by which they affect DM via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS) coupled with network pharmacology analysis.", "First, UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS was utilized to identify components of WL. Second, the putative targets of the components were identified and predicted based on chemical similarity and online databases. Third, the key candidate targets and potential active components were identified through topological analysis of a component-disease target interaction network. Finally, interactions between active components and therapeutic targets were confirmed by molecular docking analysis.", "One hundred and thirty components were identified in WL, among which 38 were considered potentially bioactive, as they showed hypoglycemic effects. Among these 38, 8 key active components possessed high similarities and shared 4 targets with approved drugs. These findings were confirmed by molecular docking analysis.", "The approach combining UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS with network pharmacology analysis is a rapid and effective tool to identify potentially bioactive constituents in medicinal plants and prescriptions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
