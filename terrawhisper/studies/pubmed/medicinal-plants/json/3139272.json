All three fractions inhibited the ovalbumin-induced contractions of indomethacin-pretreated tracheal spirals from sensitized animals dose dependently, but only L5 and n-butanol inhibited such contractions in the absence of indomethacin. The concentrations required to inhibit ovalbumin-induced contractions of lung parenchymal strips were threefold higher than with trachea. The contractile response over a 60-min period was divided into three phases. F2 and n-butanol inhibited all phases, whereas L5 inhibited only the late phase. n-Butanol and L5 inhibited arachidonic acid-induced contractions on indomethacin-pretreated tracheal spirals, a leukotriene-dependent reaction. There was no inhibition of arachidonic acid-induced contractions of lung parenchymal strips, which is largely a thromboxane-dependent reaction. The results suggest that D. adscendens contains several pharmacologically active substances that can inhibit allergic airway smooth muscle contraction at multiple sites, including the synthesis and (or) activity of the bronchoconstrictor leukotrienes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Physiology, Atlantic Veterinary College, University of Prince Edward Island, Charlottetown, Canada."}], "LastName": "Addy", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Burka", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372712", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4212"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Arachidonic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Butanols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YG812J1I", "NameOfSubstance": "Arachidonic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8PJ61P6TS3", "NameOfSubstance": "1-Butanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9006-59-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Ovalbumin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XXE1CET956", "NameOfSubstance": "Indomethacin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "1-Butanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Anaphylaxis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arachidonic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Arachidonic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Butanols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indomethacin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ovalbumin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3139272", "10.1139/y88-130"]}}]}
