Black tea have thousands of various biological compounds such as flavonoids (Thearubigins (TRs) and theaflavins (TFs) and catechins), amino acids (L.theanine), vitamins (A, C, K), phenolic acids (caffeic acid (CA), gallic acid (GA), chlorogenic acids (CGA) and cauramic acid), lipids, proteins, volatile compounds carbohydrates, \u03b2-carotene and fluoride that illustrated many promising pharmacological effects regarded as growth promoter, cardioprotector, potent cholesterol-lowering effect, antioxidant and antimicrobial, etc inhuman. Although there is an exponential growth in molecular evidence of cholesterol-lowering and antioxidant effect in human, there is still a lack of information of the pharmacological effects of black tea. To fill this information gap, therefore, this review article underscores broadening the new insight pertaining to black tea that could be used as safe food additive. This article also illuminates the interesting role of black tea as an herbal medicine that is the future demand to get rid of synthetic health promoters in the human health practice. Moreover, this information would be useful in terms of the low-cost practice of natural medicines with no residual effects, and a natural protection of the human being. In addition, further studies at a molecular level are needed to reveal its mechanism of action particularly for the hypocholesterolemic effect of black tea to overcome the heart-related diseases, fewer side effects and being a natural safeguard of human health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
