After other measures of nationalization and unification of research, in 1951 the research sections of the VKU and the pharmaceutical sections of the Research Institute of CCHZ were fused to form the Research Institute for Pharmacy and Biochemistry (VUFB). The section the VUFB taking care of the quality of production was transformed into the Pharmaceutical Control Institute (KUF). Each of the institutes had its own farm for breeding experimental animals outside Prague. In 1958, KUF was transformed into the Research Institute of Medicinal Plants (VULERO) and later, in 1960, into the Research Institute of Natural Substances (VUPL), which eventually fused with VUFB in 1967. During the years of increasing activities of VUFB, a chemical pilot plant was established in Olomouc, and a department of clinical pharmacology in Plzen. Research activities of VUFB were aimed to search for original drugs and to develop non-proprietary medicines in the field of the central and vegetative nervous systems, blood circulation, inflammatory processes, microbial infections, carcinostatic drugs, etc. In natural substances, the greatest attention was paid to ergot alkaloids, but the extent of research also included the constituents of the poppy, periwinkle, and other plants. An important part of the programme was also the breeding and cultivation of selected medicinal plants. The results of research were continuously published in both inland and foreign scholarly journals and at conferences and congresses. Every year, usually more than 100 papers were published and 40-50 for patents applications were submitted. The activity of the Institute resulted in the production of 30 original substances which were introduced into therapeutic practice. Twenty of them are still commonly prescribed. Some of these original substances got into foreign markets, particularly Prothiaden and Trimepranol represented important exports. In addition, 83 non-proprietary drugs were introduced into the inland market."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "vtrcka@seznam.cz"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trcka", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Pades\u00e1t let V\u00fdzkumn\u00e9ho \u00fastavu pro farmacii a biochemii."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Czech Republic", "MedlineTA": "Ceska Slov Farm", "NlmUniqueID": "9433765", "ISSNLinking": "1210-7816"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Academies and Institutes"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Biochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Czech Republic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12789769"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
