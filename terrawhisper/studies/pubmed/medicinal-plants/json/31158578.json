The title compounds were easily synthesized from reaction of appropriate coumarins and 3-aryl-5-(chloromethyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazole derivatives. In vivo anticonvulsant activity of the synthesized compounds were determined using pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)- and maximal electroshock (MES)-induced seizures confirming that they were more effective against MES test than PTZ test. It should be noted that compounds 3b, 3c, and 3e showed the best activity in MES model which possessed drug-like properties with no neurotoxicity. Anticonvulsant activity of the most potent compound 3b was remarkably reduced after treatment with flumazenil which confirmed the participation of a benzodiazepine mechanism in the anticonvulsant activity. Also, docking study of compound 3b in the BZD-binding site of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor confirmed possible binding of 3b to the BZD receptors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
