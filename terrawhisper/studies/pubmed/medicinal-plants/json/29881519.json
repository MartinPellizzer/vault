Thus, the evaluation of treatment approach for this problem is an important priority for healthcare systems. Sexual life and its related disorders are considered the main aspects of a healthy lifestyle in traditional Persian medicine (TPM).", "The present study aimed to determine and compare the effects of food products containing Daucus carota, TPM-based training program, and a combination of these two interventions on the improvement of female sexual dysfunction.", "This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 96 women with sexual dysfunction based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5\u00ae), aged 18-35 years who referred to the Gynecology Clinic of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran, during 2016 and 2017. The patients were randomly divided into three groups (n=32) and received the intervention over an eight-week period. The first group was provided with TPM-based sexual health training, the second group received 30 g of a traditional food product (wild carrot halva: mixed Daucus carota and several herbs with honey) on a daily basis, and the third group received a combination of this traditional food product plus education.

Furthermore, TPM-based education alone, led to the improvement of all domains of sexual dysfunction, except for pain in the females with sexual dysfunction.", "The trial was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials with the IRCT ID: IRCT2015122425681N1).", "The present study was supported by a grant from the Research Council, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran (ref. no.: 941503)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ph.D. Student of Persian Medicine, Department of Persian and complementary Medicine, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Molkara", "ForeName": "Tahereh", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gynecologist, Professor, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Akhlaghi", "ForeName": "Farideh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Assistant Professor of Sexual Health and Sex therapy-Family and Couple Therapy, Family Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ramezani", "ForeName": "Mohammad Arash", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ph.D. of Drug Control, Assistant Professor, Department of Clinical Persian Pharmacy, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Salari", "ForeName": "Roshanak", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Community Medicine Specialist, Assistant Professor, Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vakili", "ForeName": "Veda", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "M.Sc., Researcher, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kamalinejad", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Psychiatrist, Professor, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bordbar", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza Fayyazi", "Initials": "MRF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ph.D. of Physiology, Associate Professor, Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ph.D. of Persian Medicine, Assistant Professor, Department of Persian and Complementary Medicine, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Motavasselian", "ForeName": "Malihe", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Electron Physician", "NlmUniqueID": "101645099", "ISSNLinking": "2008-5842"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict of Interest: There is no conflict of interest to be declared."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Association AP.
