The 15 canines with cardiogenic shock were randomly divided in to glucose injection group, shenfu injection group and sham-operated group. The hemodynamics parameters were monitored. Plasma TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Expression of TNF-alpha mRNA and IL-1beta mRNA in myocardium were detected by RT-PCR.", "Following cardiogenic shock, the mean artery pressure (MAP), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), ventricular pressure rise ratio during systolic period (+ dp/dt(max)), and ventricular pressure decay ratio during diastolic period (- dp/dt(max)) decreased significantly; the plasma TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels and the expression of TNF-a mRNA and IL-1beta mRNA in myocardium increased significantly. In shenfu injection group, MAP, LVSP and +/- dp/dt(max) increased significantly and plasma TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels decreased significantly. In glucose injection group, MAP, LVSP, +/- dp/dt(max) and plasma TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels had not changed significantly. The expression of TNF-alpha mRNA and IL-1beta mRNA in myocardium were significantly lower in shenfu injection group than those in glucose injection group.", "Shenfu injection probably can decrease over-exprssion of TNF-alpha mRNA and IL-1beta mRNA on transcription platform. Shenfu injection counteract cardiogenic shock, relieve myocardium damage and improve hemodynamics through inhibiting overproduction of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geriatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing University of Medical Science, Chongqing 400010, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ke", "ForeName": "Da-Zhi", "Initials": "DZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qing-Wei", "Initials": "QW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chun-Li", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Gui-Qiong", "Initials": "GQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1beta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Shen-Fu"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aconitum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "blood", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hemodynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "blood", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1beta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Shock, Cardiogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "blood", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18309672"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
