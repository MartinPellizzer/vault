Four main mechanisms responsible for regulating hepatic lipid metabolism are fatty acid uptake, de novo lipogenesis, lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Controlling the expression of transcription factors at molecular level plays a crucial role in NAFLD management. This paper reviews various medicinal plants and their bioactive compounds emphasising mechanisms involved in hepatic lipid metabolism, other important NAFLD pathological features, and their promising roles in managing NAFLD through regulating key transcription factors. Although there are many medicinal plants popularly investigated for NAFLD treatment, there is still little information and scientific evidence available and there has been no research on clinical trials scrutinised on this matter. This review also aims to provide molecular information of medicinal plants in NALFD treatment that might have potentials for future scientifically controlled studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, Health Campus, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kelantan, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Zakaria", "ForeName": "Zaida", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, Health Campus, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kelantan, Malaysia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin, Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Othman", "ForeName": "Zaidatul Akmal", "Initials": "ZA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7616-9468"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Nna", "ForeName": "Victor Udo", "Initials": "VU"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9333-1957"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, Health Campus, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kelantan, Malaysia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Integrative Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, Health Campus, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kelantan, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Mohamed", "ForeName": "Mahaneem", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Arch Physiol Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9510153", "ISSNLinking": "1381-3455"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34153200", "10.1080/13813455.2021.1939387"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
