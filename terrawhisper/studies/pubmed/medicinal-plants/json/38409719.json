A Basic Analysis of Clinic Pharmacy.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["As a malignant tumor, osteosarcoma (OS) ranks first place among adolescent cancers and is susceptible to developing resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Differently, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has multiple pharmacodynamic targets and complex biological components, which can inhibit tumor survival and drug resistance and gradually play an important role in the treatment of sarcoma.", "This study is to systematically evaluate the safety and efficacy of TCM combined with chemotherapy performed in the clinical treatment of OS. Based on multiple mainstream databases, eleven articles on the relationship between natural products and chemotherapy involving 656 patients were selected from all the literature published as of June 2022. Revman 5.4 software was used for a comprehensive search analysis, supplemented by established exclusion criteria, the Jadad scale, and the evaluation methods provided by Cochrane.", "The efficiency of TCM combined with chemotherapy was significantly increased compared with chemical drugs alone [OR=2.56, 95% CI (1.36,4.79), Z=2.92, P=0.003]. Meanwhile, the adverse reactions such as nausea and vomiting, hepatotoxicity, and hematological changes caused by chemical drugs were alleviated correspondingly.", "This study indicates that the mode of TCM combined with chemotherapy sheds light on the clinical treatment of OS, which is much better than the one-way mode."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dalian Municipal Central Hospital Department of Orthopedics Dalian China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jian-Yu", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dalian University of Technology School of Life and Pharmaceutical Sciences Dalian China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Ya-Ru", "Initials": "YR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dalian University of Technology School of Life and Pharmaceutical Sciences Dalian China."}], "LastName": "Bao", "ForeName": "Yu-Qi", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dalian University of Technology School of Life and Pharmaceutical Sciences Dalian China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dalian University of Technology School of Biomedical Engineering Dalian China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Affiliated Hospital to Changchun University of Chinese Medicine Department of Orthopedics Changchun China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Chang-Wei", "Initials": "CW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dalian University of Technology School of Life and Pharmaceutical Sciences Dalian China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zheng-Yao", "Initials": "ZY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Meta-Analysis"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Comb Chem High Throughput Screen", "NlmUniqueID": "9810948", "ISSNLinking": "1386-2073"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "27"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38409719", "10.2174/0113862073264769231116062123", "CCHTS-EPUB-138727"]}}]}
