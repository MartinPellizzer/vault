Hypericum sampsoniiwas investigated, leading to the isolation of two highly modified seco-polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAPs) (1 and 2), eight phenolic derivatives (3-10), and four terpene derivatives (11-14). The structures of compounds 1 and 2, featuring an unprecedented octahydro-2H-chromen-2-one ring system, were fully characterized using extensive spectroscopic data and quantum chemistry calculations. Six compounds (1, 5-7, 9, and 14) exhibited potential inhibitory effects against \u03b1-glucosidase, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.050 \u00b1 0.0016 to 366.70 \u00b1 11.08 \u03bcg\u00b7mL<sup>-1</sup>. Notably, compound 5 (0.050 \u00b1 0.0016 \u03bcg\u00b7mL<sup>-1</sup>) was identified as the most potential \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor, with an inhibitory effect about 6900 times stronger than the positive control, acarbose (IC<sub>50</sub> = 346.63 \u00b1 15.65 \u03bcg\u00b7mL<sup>-1</sup>). A docking study was conducted to predict molecular interactions between two compounds (1 and 5) and \u03b1-glucosidase, and the hypothetical biosynthetic pathways of the two unprecedented seco-PPAPs were proposed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 China Pharmaceutical University.
