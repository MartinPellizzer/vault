The current study evaluated the potential of icariin (ICA) to guard against thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver fibrosis in rats.", "Four groups of male rats were treated as follows: group 1 was the control group, group 2 was given TAA (200mg/kg), group 3 was administered ICA (50mg/kg) and TAA (200mg/kg), and group 4 was given ICA (50mg/kg) alone. Animal treatment was continued for four weeks.", "Co-administration of ICA guarded against TAA hepatotoxicity as indicated by significant inhibition in the rise of serum ALT and AST activities and albumin concentrations. This was accompanied by inhibition of reduced glutathione depletion, superoxide dismutase exhaustion, and lipid peroxide accumulation. In addition, ICA inhibited the pathological alterations in liver architecture induced by TAA. The antifibrotic activity of ICA was verified by reduced hepatic collagen deposition in liver sections stained with Masson's trichrome and hepatic Col-1\u03b1 mRNA and hydroxyproline contents compared to the TAA-treated group. The antiangiogenic activity of ICA was evidenced by lowered levels of mRNA of Ang-1 and protein expression of VEGF, PDGF-\u03b2, and CTGF immunohistochemically. Further, the anti-autophagic property of ICA was evidenced by amelioration of the decrease in mTOR and p70S6 kinase expression and an increase in TLR4, NF\u03baB, IL1-\u03b2, and COX-2 immunohistochemically. Moreover, ICA antagonized the increase in HMGB1, TGF-\u03b2, and Beclin-1 and the decrease in BAMBI hepatic mRNA levels.", "ICA inhibits TAA-induced liver fibrosis in rats, possibly via inhibition of angiogenesis and autophagy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017.
