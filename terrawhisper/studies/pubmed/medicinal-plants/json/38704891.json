Long-lasting HUA may lead to a number of diseases including gout and kidney injury. Harpagoside (Harp) is a bioactive compound with potent anti-inflammatory activity from the roots of Scrophularia ningpoensis. Nevertheless, its potential effect on HUA was not reported. The anti-HUA and nephroprotective effects of Harp on HUA mice were assessed by biochemical and histological analysis. The proteins responsible for UA production and transportation were investigated to figure out its anti-HUA mechanism, while proteins related to NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 pathway were evaluated to reveal its nephroprotective mechanism. The safety was evaluated by testing its effect on body weight and organ coefficients. The results showed that Harp significantly reduced the SUA level and protected the kidney against HUA-induced injury but had no negative effect on safety. Mechanistically, Harp significantly reduced UA production by acting as inhibitors of xanthine oxidase (XOD) and adenosine deaminase (ADA) and decreased UA excretion by acting as activators of ABCG2, OAT1 and inhibitors of GLUT9 and URAT1. Moreover, Harp markedly reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells and down-regulated expressions of TNF-\u03b1, NF-\u03baB, NLRP3 and IL-1\u03b2 in the kidney. Harp was a promising anti-HUA agent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
