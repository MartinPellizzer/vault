An alcoholic extract, chloroform extract, and an aqueous extract were tested. Drugs were administered in 6 female mice 5 days after mating. Laparotomy was performed on the 10th day of pregnancy to observe the implants and delivery by Cesarean section was made at 20 days. Female rats were similarly treated. Female rats were studied as well for estreus cycle and mating behavior under the influence of the drug. Antiestrogenic activity was tested in mature mice and androgenic activity was tested in immature male mice at 6 different extract doses. Decidual cell reaction was tested in rats with pseudopregnancy given different doses of the extract daily. Abortifacient and teratogenic actions were studied. Pharmacological studies included antiinflammatory studies, isolated tissues, blood pressure and respiration, diuretic action, and acute toxicity. Results indicate only the alcohol extract to be active. It has a distinct antifertility effect in rats but without a clearcut dose-response relationship. There was an incomplete suppression of fertility at 100 mg/kg. Estreus cycle was uneffected by the extracts although there was delayed mating in half the animals and a significant reduction in offspring. There was some inhibition of ovulation produced by the extract. Differences between controls and treated groups were insignificant regarding antiestrogenic activity and androgenic activity. There was a partial blocking of the decidual cell reaction. Complete resorption of implants was seen in 4 out of 5 mice when the extract was given at 1 gm/kg. The only other pharmacological action noted was inhibition of the action of acetylcholine and histamine on the guinea pig ileum. Pharamcodynamic and toxic effects are probably unrelated to the antifertility action of the extract."]}], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "PMID": "5382965", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1970", "Month": "07", "Day": "01"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0019-5499", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "13", "Issue": "4", "PubDate": {"Year": "1969", "Month": "Oct"}}, "Title": "Indian journal of physiology and pharmacology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Indian J Physiol Pharmacol"}, "ArticleTitle": "Antifertility effect and some pharmacological actions of Butea frondosa seed extracts.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "239", "EndPage": "249", "MedlinePgn": "239-49"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Razdan", "ForeName": "M K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kapila", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhide", "ForeName": "N K", "Initials": "NK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0374707", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5499"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "B2V233XGE7", "NameOfSubstance": "Mestranol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N2Z8ALG4U5", "NameOfSubstance": "Lynestrenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Decidua"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Diuresis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Estrus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fertility"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lynestrenol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Mestranol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ovulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1969", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1969", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1969", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["5382965"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
