The attitudes of these patients regarding these therapies and their perceptions of safety and efficacy have not been well defined.", "A written survey was received from a cohort of outpatients seen at a large outpatient cardiovascular clinic in Texas. Over 75% of patients responded, with more than 90% of returned surveys adequate for analysis.", "Of the 210 respondents 113 admitted to CAM use, with Vitamins E and C being the most frequently utilized agents. Women were significantly more likely to take CAM than men (69 vs. 46%, p = 0.002), particularly those taking hormone replacement therapy. Over half of patients surveyed stated their cardiologist was unaware of their use of CAM. Only 15% of patients felt that CAM was more efficacious than their traditional medications, but almost half felt it was significantly safer. A similar number were unaware of any interactions between CAM and their other medications.", "Use of CAM is common in cardiology outpatients, and many patients remain unaware of potential health risks. Physicians should routinely question patients about use of CAM and attempt to educate users regarding potential health risks."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Wilford Hall Medical Center, Lackland AFB, USA. krasusr@ccf.org"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krasuski", "ForeName": "Richard A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Michaelis", "ForeName": "Kyle", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eckart", "ForeName": "Robert E", "Initials": "RE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Clin Cardiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903272", "ISSNLinking": "0160-9289"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cardiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cohort Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Estrogen Replacement Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Outpatients"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patient Acceptance of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Texas"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Eisenberg DM, Davis RB, Ettner SL, Appel S, Wilkey S, Van Rompay M, Kessler RC: Trends in alternative medicine use in the United States, 1990\u20131997: Results of a follow\u2010up national survey.
