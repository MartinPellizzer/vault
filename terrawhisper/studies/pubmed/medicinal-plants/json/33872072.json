The protective effects of <i>Diospyros kaki</i> fruit aqueous extract (DKFAE) against castor oil (CO)-induced diarrhea was studied. The <i>in vitro</i> antioxidant and antibacterial properties were investigated using colorimetric and biochemical analyses. <i>In vivo</i>, 60 male rats were divided into 6 groups of 10 animals each (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200910): control (C), CO, CO+various doses of DKFAE (100, 200, and 400\u2009mg/kg, <i>b.w.</i>, <i>p.o.</i>), and CO+loperamide (LOP, 10\u2009mg/kg, <i>b.w.</i>, <i>p.o.</i>).The DKFAE was rich in tannins and showed interesting antioxidant and antibacterial activities. The liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) analysis resulted in the identification of 16 phenolic compounds, among which quinic acid was the main one. The <i>in vivo</i> study showed that diarrhea was accompanied by an oxidative stress status as measured by an increase of lipid peroxidation, a decrease of glutathione and thiol group levels, as well as antioxidant enzyme activity depletion, such as glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase. The DKFAE administration significantly decreased the gastrointestinal transit in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, DKFAE protected against CO-induced diarrhea and intestinal fluid accumulation. Interestingly, DKFAE pretreatment counteracted all the oxidative stress status deregulation induced by CO intoxication. <i>D. kaki</i> fruit could be suggested for its strong protective effect against CO-induced acute diarrhea, which could be explained, in part, to its antimicrobial and antioxidant properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Functional Physiology and Valorization of Bio-Resources, University of Jendouba, Higher Institute of Biotechnology of B\u00e9ja, B\u00e9ja, Tunisia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Sciences of Bizerte, University of Carthage, Zarzouna, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Dhawefi", "ForeName": "Nourh\u00e8ne", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Functional Physiology and Valorization of Bio-Resources, University of Jendouba, Higher Institute of Biotechnology of B\u00e9ja, B\u00e9ja, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Jedidi", "ForeName": "Saber", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Functional Physiology and Valorization of Bio-Resources, University of Jendouba, Higher Institute of Biotechnology of B\u00e9ja, B\u00e9ja, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Rtibi", "ForeName": "Kais", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Enzyme Engineering and Microbiology, National Engineering School of Sfax, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Jridi", "ForeName": "Mourad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Functional Physiology and Valorization of Bio-Resources, University of Jendouba, Higher Institute of Biotechnology of B\u00e9ja, B\u00e9ja, Tunisia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Sciences of Bizerte, University of Carthage, Zarzouna, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Sammeri", "ForeName": "Houcem", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Functional Physiology and Valorization of Bio-Resources, University of Jendouba, Higher Institute of Biotechnology of B\u00e9ja, B\u00e9ja, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Abidi", "ForeName": "Chaima", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Higher Institute of Applied Biology of Medenine, Unversity of Gabes, Medenine, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Zouari", "ForeName": "Nacim", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Functional Physiology and Valorization of Bio-Resources, University of Jendouba, Higher Institute of Biotechnology of B\u00e9ja, B\u00e9ja, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Sebai", "ForeName": "Hichem", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidiarrheals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antidiarrheals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diospyros"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33872072", "10.1089/jmf.2020.0202"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
