It is the most common type of dementia in the ageing population due to a severe loss of cholinergic neurons in selected brain area. At present, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) are the first group of drugs approved by the FDA to treat mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Most of these drugs such as huperzine and galanthamine are originally isolated from plants. In this study, the AChE inhibitory activities from extracts of Chinese medicinal herbs that have traditionally been prescribed to treat insomnia and brain function disorders were examined in a 96-well plate assay based on Ellman's method. Both ethanol and aqueous extracts of 26 traditional Chinese medicinal herbs were tested. Inhibitory effects were expressed as the percentage of inhibition. For the herbal extracts that were shown to exert a significant inhibition, dose-dependent inhibitory assays were also performed. Ethanol and aqueous extracts of six herbs were found to have high AChE inhibitory activities in a dose-dependent manner. The IC(50) of these herbal extracts on inhibition of AChE are at around 5-85 microm/ml. The results of this study indicate that there is a great potential to search for novel usage of these medicinal herbs for the treatment of AD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong, SAR, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "H Q", "Initials": "HQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ho", "ForeName": "Michelle T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lau", "ForeName": "Lesley S", "Initials": "LS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "Kelvin K", "Initials": "KK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shaw", "ForeName": "P C", "Initials": "PC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "David C C", "Initials": "DC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biol Interact", "NlmUniqueID": "0227276", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2797"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18573242", "10.1016/j.cbi.2008.05.030", "S0009-2797(08)00309-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
