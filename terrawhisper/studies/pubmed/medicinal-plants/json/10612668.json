Neither of these two sobemoviruses systemically infects the permissive host of the other. Although bean cells are permissive for SCPMV RNA synthesis, they do not support the assembly of this virus. Thus, the host range restriction of SCPMV in bean may occur at the level of movement and may involve the inability of SCPMV to assemble in this host. In this study, it was demonstrated that SCPMV accumulates in an encapsidated form in the inoculated and systemic leaves of bean plants following coinoculation with SBMV. No evidence was observed that the SCPMV that accumulated in coinoculated bean plants had an altered host range relative to wild-type SCPMV. These results suggested that SBMV complemented the host range restriction of SCPMV in bean. Additional experiments demonstrated that cowpea protoplasts are permissive for SBMV RNA synthesis and assembly. It was concluded from these results that the host range restriction of SBMV in cowpea occurs at the level of movement. In mixed infections of cowpea with SCPMV and SBMV, the latter was recovered from the inoculated but not the systemic leaves. Its recovery from the inoculated leaves, however, was not dependent on the presence of SCPMV in the inoculum. From these results, it was concluded that SCPMV did not complement the host range restriction of SBMV in cowpea."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2000 Academic Press."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Legume Research, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37996-0845, USA. hacker@utkux.utcc.utk.edu"}], "LastName": "Hacker", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fowler", "ForeName": "B C", "Initials": "BC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM50350", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Virology", "NlmUniqueID": "0110674", "ISSNLinking": "0042-6822"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Comovirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electroporation"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Biosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Protoplasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10612668", "10.1006/viro.1999.0072", "S0042-6822(99)90072-7"]}}]}
