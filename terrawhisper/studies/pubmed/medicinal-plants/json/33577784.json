Sixty-three male mice were divided into nine controlled and treated groups as follow: control, broccoli (200\u00a0mg/kg), broccoli (300\u00a0mg/kg), caraway (200\u00a0mg/kg), caraway (300\u00a0mg/kg), broccoli -caraway (200\u00a0mg/kg), broccoli (300\u00a0mg/kg)-caraway (200\u00a0mg/kg), broccoli (200\u00a0mg/kg)-caraway (300\u00a0mg/kg), broccoli-caraway (300\u00a0mg/kg). After 42 days of treatment, the animals were sacrificed and blood sample and testicular tissue were collected for biochemical and histological measurements. Sperm quality was also measured before and after cryopreservation. The results showed that the diameter and number of spermatogonium, primary spermatocytes, spermatids and sperm count were significantly increased by broccoli (300\u00a0mg/kg), while level of them were significantly decreased by caraway (300\u00a0mg/kg) compared to other groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Sperm viability and motility after thawing significantly improved by broccoli (300\u00a0mg/kg) compared to control. Testosterone levels significantly increased by broccoli (300\u00a0mg/kg) compared to control and caraway (300\u00a0mg/kg). The serum and testicular SOD and CAT activity significantly increased by broccoli (300\u00a0mg/kg) compared to other groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). MDA and DNA fragmentation levels significantly increased by caraway (200 and 300\u00a0mg/kg) compared to others (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). It can be concluded that broccoli extract in a dose-dependent manner than caraway extract could improve serum and testes oxidative biomarkers, testicular structure and function, and sperm quality before and after cryopreservation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
