Then scopolamine hydrobrominde intraperitoneal injection was performed on each rat, and the MORRIS water maze test and step-though test were carried out respectively to explore the changes of the rats' learning and memory capacities. Primary rat cortex neurons were cultured in vitro for 7 days, and then serum containing CYZ was added to neurons before or after the addition of beta Amyloid peptide25-35 (A beta 25-35) to observe CYZ's protectiveness on neurotoxicity. MTT assay and test of level of LDH in the culture media were performed to achieve this aim.", "Compared with control group, in MORRIS water maze test time of finding the platform under the water surface decreased, and in step-though test the latent period rose and the error number got smaller. Moreover, in cultured primary neurons, the dramatic drop of LDH level in culture media and the high OD scores in MTT test indicated that CYZ could effectively resist the neurotoxicity induced by A beta 25-35.", "CYZ presented promising effects on learning and memory dysfunction and A beta-induced neurotoxicity in vitro."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangzhou Qixing Pharmaceutical Corporation Ltd, Guangzhou 510000."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Hangyu", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jiangping", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Baihua", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "amyloid beta-protein (25-35)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DL48G20X8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Scopolamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cerebral Cortex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maze Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Memory Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Scopolamine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14650060"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
