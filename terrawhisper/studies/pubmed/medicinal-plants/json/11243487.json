Collectively, the data suggest that therapeutic preparations of Hypericum extract appear to exert potentially significant pharmacological activity within several neurochemical systems believed to be implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. However, little information exists regarding the safety of Hypericum, including potential herb-drug interactions.", "Additional research on the pharmacological and biochemical activity of Hypericum and its several bioactive constituents is necessary to further elucidate the mode(s) of antidepressant action. Given what is currently known and unknown about the biological properties of Hypericum, those who choose to use this herb should be closely monitored by a physician."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Integrative Medicine, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA 19107-6799, USA. jeffrey.m.greeson@mail.tju.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Greeson", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sanford", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Monti", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)", "NlmUniqueID": "7608025", "ISSNLinking": "0033-3158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry", "therapeutic use", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Legislation, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "104"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11243487", "10.1007/s002130000625"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
