The genetic diversity index ranged from 1.2446 to 2.0560 and variation coefficient ranged from 13.22% to 59.24%. The leaf dry weight and leaf number had significant correlation (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) with traits among root tuber. Six main principal components reflected most information of 23 phenotypic traits, and the accumulative contribution rate was 76.47%. The result of the cluster analysis was that 80 germplasm of Pseudostellaria heterophylla could be divided into four groups based on phenotypic difference, the first group can be parents of progenies with high yield potential, the second group could be optimal parents of progenies with high yield, the third group can be parents of first class goods.", "The germplasm resources of cultivated Pseudostellaria heterophylla from Guizhou is useful for breeding of new varieties with abundant diversity. The second group and the third group of Pseudostellaria heterophylla have better germplasm,which can be provide parents for cross breeding of Pseudostellaria heterophylla."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Cheng-hong", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Wei-ke", "Initials": "WK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Chuan-zhi", "Initials": "CZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Ming-wu", "Initials": "MW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Caryophyllaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Tubers"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26983228"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
