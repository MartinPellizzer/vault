X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopic analyses were conducted to demonstrate the high graphitization and topological defects at the sample surface. An electrochemical sensor based on an OMC-modified glassy carbon electrode (OMC/GCE) was constructed to detect aristolochic acids (AAs) using cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry. The dependence of the experimental parameters including solution pH, scan rate, and accumulation time were examined and optimized. Under the optimal conditions, the response of OMC/GCE was linear over wide concentration ranges of AAs (0.6-10\u202f\u03bcM and 10-50\u202f\u03bcM), with sensitivities of -1.77 and -0.31\u202f\u03bcA/\u03bcM, respectively. The limit of detection was calculated to be 0.186\u202f\u03bcM (at S/N\u202f=\u202f3). Furthermore, the proposed OMC/GCE was applied to detect AAs in Asarum sieboldini and the content of AAs was calculated to be 8.9\u202f\u03bcg/g with high accuracy and precision. In addition, the modified electrode also exhibited good selectivity, reproducibility, and stability. Therefore, the OMC/GCE can be used as a platform for the determination of AAs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
