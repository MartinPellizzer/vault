This plant, native to southern Europe, northern Africa, and southeastern Asia, is used in cooking as well as for medicinal uses. The leaves are commonly referred to as cilantro. In October 2009, severe outbreaks of a previously unknown root rot were observed in a commercial field located in the Alessandria Province (northern Italy) on 20-day-old plants belonging to cv. Comune. Five percent of plants were affected, showing stunting and extensive chlorosis starting on external leaves that eventually wilted. Root systems and collars of diseased plants appeared rotted. In advanced stages, young leaves were affected and the plants eventually collapsed and tissues dried out. Tissue fragments of 1 mm<sup>2</sup> were excised from the roots of infected plants, dipped in a solution containing 1% sodium hypochlorite, and plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and a medium selective for Oomycetes (3). Plates were incubated under constant fluorescent light at 22 \u00b1 1\u00b0C for 4 to 5 days. One isolate, grown on V8 medium (vegetable mix, 300 g; agar, 15 g; CaCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.5g; and distilled water, 1 liter), and observed under a light microscope showed hyphae generally aseptate, ranging from 1.3 to 6.24 \u03bcm in diameter, and produced sporangia consisting of complexes of swollen hyphal branches. Oogonia were globose, smooth, and 20.3 to 33.4 (average 25.4) \u03bcm in diameter. Antheridia were monoclinous, extending from immediately below oogonium, and measured 10.8 to 17.8 \u00d7 7.6 to 12.7 (average 14.4 \u00d7 10.4) \u03bcm. Oospores were single, globose, aplerotic and thick walled, and 15.8 to 24.2 (average 17.8) \u03bcm in diameter. These morphological characters were used to identify the microorganism as a Pythium sp. (3). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA of a single isolate was amplified using the primers ITS1/ITS4 (2,4) and sequenced. BLAST analysis (1) of the 874-bp segment showed a 100% homology with the sequence of Pythium ultimum. The nucleotide sequence has been assigned the GenBank Accession No. GU478314. Pathogenicity tests were performed twice on coriander cv. Comune. Plants were grown in 2-liter pots containing a Brill Type 5 substrate (Brill Substrate GmbH & Co. KG, Niedersachsen, Germany) consisting of 15% blond peat, 85% black peat, pH 5.5 to 6, and pasteurized at 80\u00b0C for 30 min. The potting mix was infested at a rate of 5 g/liter with wheat and hemp kernels colonized with one strain of P. ultimum. Ten plants (1 plant per pot) were grown in the infested substrate and 10 plants were grown in noninfested substrate. Plants were kept in a growth chamber at 20\u00b0C. The first symptoms, consisting of reduced growth and chlorosis, developed within 7 days, while control plants remained healthy. P. ultimum was consistently isolated from the roots. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. ultimum causing disease of coriander in Italy as well as worldwide. At this time, the economic importance of Pythium rot on coriander in Italy remains unknown. References: (1) S. F. Altschul et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389, 1997. (2) W. Chen et al. Exp.
