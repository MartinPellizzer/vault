The diagnosis of lentil allergy was based on food challenges or a convincing history of anaphylaxis, with positive skin tests and/or specific serum IgE to lentils. Lentil components were characterized by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting.", "Twenty of 22 subjects had symptomatic allergy to lentils at the diagnostic time. The most frequent symptoms were oropharyngeal symptoms (40%) and acute urticaria (30%); 3 patients also reported symptoms when they were exposed to steam from cooked lentils. In 18 patients, symptoms after lentil ingestion started under 4 years of age (median, 2.7 years). Nine patients had allergic reactions to other legumes: chick peas (6 patients), peas (2 patients), and green beans (1 patient). Immunoblotting patterns obtained with patients' sera showed IgE-binding bands ranging from 14 to 84 kd. Five sera recognized 9 or more IgE-binding bands, and more than 50% of patients who were tested have specific IgE antibodies to 7 components in lentil extract.", "Allergic reactions to lentils started early in life, usually below 4 years of age; oropharyngeal symptoms and acute urticaria were the most common symptoms through ingestion, and symptomatic reactivity to chick peas is frequently associated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hospital Infantil La Paz, Madrid, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pascual", "ForeName": "C Y", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fernandez-Crespo", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sanchez-Pastor", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Padial", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Diaz-Pena", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martin-Mu\u00f1oz", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martin-Esteban", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Allergy Clin Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "1275002", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6749"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mediterranean Region"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Single-Blind Method"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9893199", "10.1016/s0091-6749(99)70539-7", "S0091-6749(99)70539-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
