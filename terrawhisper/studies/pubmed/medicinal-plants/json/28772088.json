We assumed that zoledronate may have cytotoxicity against stem cells of the oral cavity and in this way helps to initiate or promote osteonecrosis. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and gingival fibroblasts (GFs) were isolated from volunteers who were undergoing a third molar extraction. The proliferation of DPSCs and GFs was evaluated using the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assay. The effect of zoledronate on apoptosis was determined by propidium iodide staining and Western blotting analysis. Incubation with zoledronate for 72 h and 7 days significantly decreased proliferation of DPSCs and GFs at concentrations of more than 0.4 \u03bcmol/L (p < 0.001). The IC<sub>50</sub> of zoledronate was lower for DPSCs than for GFs (0.92 versus 3.5 \u03bcmol/L for 7 days of treatment). After 72 h of treatment with zoledronate, the percentage of apoptotic DPSCs significantly increased, which was accompanied by an increased level of pro-apoptotic proteins caspase-3 and Bax and decreased the level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. In conclusion, zoledronate has anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in DPSCs. These effects may be involved in promoting zoledronate-induced osteonecrosis and suggest an unfavorable impact of this drug on regenerative potentials of the body stem cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Pourgonabadi", "ForeName": "Solmaz", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Medical Toxicology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mousavi", "ForeName": "Seyed Hadi", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Pharmacodynamics and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tayarani-Najaran", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372712", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4212"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diphosphonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Imidazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6XC1PAD3KF", "NameOfSubstance": "Zoledronic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Shape"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Pulp"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diphosphonates"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Gingiva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Imidazoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Stem Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zoledronic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28772088", "10.1139/cjpp-2016-0348"]}}]}
