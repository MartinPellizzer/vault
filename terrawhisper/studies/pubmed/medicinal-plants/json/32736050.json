Plasma samples were collected for pharmacokinetic evaluation, and whole blood samples were collected for pharmacodynamic evaluation. In addition, an in-vitro mechanistic study is conducted to investigate the role of danshensu on the anti-thrombotic and anti-platelet aggregation effects of warfarin and aspirin respectively.", "Significant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic herb-drug interactions were observed in healthy human subjects. pharmacokinetically, co-administration of DG with aspirin or warfarin could lead to a moderately increased AUC<sub>0\u2192t</sub> of aspirin and a decreased AUC<sub>0\u2192t</sub> of 7-hydroxyl warfarin respectively. The systemic exposure of danshensu (DSS, the marker component of DG) would be significantly increased after co-administration with warfarin. Pharmacodynamically, a reduction in systemic thromboxane B2 concentration was noticed after administration of DG with aspirin, which could be associated with the increased systemic exposure of aspirin and the synergistic effect of danshensu, aspirin and salicylic acid on cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. An offset on the warfarin induced soluble thrombomodulin induction was observed after its co-administration with DG, which could be partially attributed to the COX-2 inhibition effect of danshensu.", "Our results indicated that co-administration of DG with aspirin/warfarin would lead to significant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic herb-drug interactions in healthy human subjects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
