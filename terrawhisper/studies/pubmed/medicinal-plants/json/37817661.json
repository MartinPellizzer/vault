Calebin-A occurs naturally in trace quantities in Curcuma longa/C cassia, commonly known as turmeric, from the Zingiberaceae family. Calebin-A is a curcumin analog or 'chemical cousin' of curcumin with a similar chemical structure. Although few research studies have been conducted on the pharmacological and therapeutic properties of calebin-A, it is a very promising molecule with a variety of pharmacological properties. Some studies have suggested that calebin-A is helpful in treating various cancers due to its inhibitory effect on cell growth and anti-inflammatory properties. Other studies have suggested that calebin-A may improve neurocognitive status associated with neurodegeneration caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) by inhibiting the aggregation of \u03b2-amyloid. Finally, several studies have proposed that calebin-A may potentially be therapeutically beneficial in treating patients with obesity. This novel compound downregulates nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB-mediated processes involved with cancer, such as tumor cell invasion, proliferation, metastasis, and, most profoundly, inflammation. Moreover, calebin-A influences the activities of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in cancer cells. The present review identifies and discusses the pharmacological and phytochemical properties of calebin-A, as well as its therapeutic benefits and limitations, for future scientists and clinicians interested in exploring calebin-A's medicinal qualities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology & Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "GI Pharmacology Interest Group (GPIG), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shamsnia", "ForeName": "Hedieh", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Samanian", "ForeName": "Amirreza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology & Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sabbagh Kashani", "ForeName": "Ayeh", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology & Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "GI Pharmacology Interest Group (GPIG), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khayatan", "ForeName": "Danial", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Institute of Medicinal Plants, ACECR, Karaj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology and Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, and Toxicology and Diseases Group, Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center (PSRC), The Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (TIPS), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "GI Pharmacology Interest Group (GPIG), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Momtaz", "ForeName": "Saeideh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri, USA."}], "LastName": "Johnston", "ForeName": "Thomas P", "Initials": "TP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sabinsa Corporation, East Windsor, NJ, United States.
