Current study aimed to compile a review over chemical composition and medicinal properties of this plant in modern phytotherapy and its related multipotential products from traditional Persian medicine (TPM). Medicinal applications of V.\u00a0odorata and respective products were derived from credible pharmaceutical textbooks of TPM (10th-18th century AD). In parallel, electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect were explored for targeted purposes. Management of cough, fever, common cold, headache, insomnia, epilepsy, constipation, palpitation, dyspnea, dysuria, and skin diseases is of most applications of V.\u00a0odorata, reported in TPM. On the other side, this herb plant has exerted antiinflammatory, analgesic, antioxidant, diuretic, antihypertensive, and antibacterial activities in modern phytotherapy. Violet TPM therapeutic preparations are including violet oil in the form of nasal or topical application for neurologic and skin disorders as well as pill, decoction, sweet syrup, and confection or semisolid oral preparations for skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary ailments. Flavonoids, saponins, and alkaloids are responsible for pharmacological activities. Some medical applications of V.\u00a0odorata in TPM have been proven by recent studies. However, more studies are needed to confirm these medicinal properties.
