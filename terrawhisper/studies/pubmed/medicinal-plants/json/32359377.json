These molecules were chosen based on two reasons; the limited or total absence of their exploitation in several studied activities and the use of other tests for the same activity. The evaluation of the in vitro anti-acetyl-cholinesterase (AChE), anti-5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), anti-xanthine oxidase (XOD), anti-alpha glucosidase, anti-superoxide dismutase (SOD), anti-oxidant (DPPH (1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2, 2- azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate)), and anticancer activities of mentioned 19 molecules was explored during this work. M3, M14, M15, M16, M17, M18, M19 were exploited for the first time for such purposes. Tested compounds were shown to have interesting radical scavenging abilities against DPPH radicals, and the highest molecules among them were M19 and M5 (IC50 = 12.0 and 15.5 \u00b5M, respectively), and M4, M19 and M2 against ABTS (IC50= 1.9, 4.3 and 4.3 \u00b5M, respectively). Moreover, the majority of products showed very important cytotoxic activity since IC50 values were ranging between (IC50= 0.2 \u00b5M (M1) and 79 \u00b5M (M8)) against HCT116 cell line, and values of IC50= 0.2 \u00b5M for M1 against MCF7 cell line. All new molecules (non studied before) were shown to have great cytotoxic effect against both cancer cell lines.Furthermore, molecule M5 was shown to have anti-inflammatory potential via the inhibition of 5-LOX enzyme (65% at 100 \u00b5M). In addition, M19 showed important anti XOD activity with 47% of inhibition at 100 \u00b5M. Also, it has been found that compound M3 had the best anti alpha glucosidase activity with 43.8 % of inhibition at 100 \u00b5M, the highest anti-AChE effect (IC50= 14.5 \u00b5M), and the best effect towards SOD (IC50= 10.0 \u00b5M).\u00a0 A structure-activity relationship study was also performed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Aromatic and Medicinal Plants (LPAM) Center for Biotechnology at the Ecopark of Borj-C\u00e9dria, BP 901, Hammam-lif 2050, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Khelifi", "ForeName": "Imen", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Aromatic and Medicinal Plants (LPAM) Center for Biotechnology at the Ecopark of Borj-C\u00e9dria, BP 901, Hammam-lif 2050, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Hayouni", "ForeName": "El Akrem", "Initials": "EA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Toulouse, University Paul-Sabatier, Faculty of Pharmacy of Toulouse, Laboratory of IMRCP UMR CNRS 5623, 118 road of Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse, France."}], "LastName": "Cazaux", "ForeName": "Sylvie", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Aromatic and Medicinal Plants (LPAM) Center for Biotechnology at the Ecopark of Borj-C\u00e9dria, BP 901, Hammam-lif 2050, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Ksouri", "ForeName": "Riadh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Toulouse, University Paul-Sabatier, Faculty of Pharmacy of Toulouse, Laboratory of IMRCP UMR CNRS 5623, 118 road of Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse, France."}], "LastName": "Bouajila", "ForeName": "Jalloul", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.17.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthine Oxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.20", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Glucosidases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Death"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HCT116 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "MCF-7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthine Oxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Glucosidases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32359377"]}}]}
