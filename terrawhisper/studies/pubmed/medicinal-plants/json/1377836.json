In this work the actions of PTL on artificial lipid bilayer were investigated by means of the two-compartment system of Mueller and Rudin. The lipid bilayer with resistance more than 10G omega was formed by a solution of lecithin and cholesterol (20 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml respectively) in N-decane. The electrical properties of the lipid bilayer were investigated in voltage clamp mode. Several minutes after the addition of PTL (2 micrograms/ml) in one compartment the channel-like noise as well as a decrease of the resistance of the bilayer were observed. These actions were inhibited by mannan significantly. The resistance increase of the bilayer with PTL-channels could be observed from 2G omega to control level (greater than or equal to 10 G omega) immediately after addition of 40 micrograms/ml mannan. The discrete conduction steps were recorded at low concentration of PTL and at low holding potential. The predominant unit conductance was 35pS in symmetric KCl solution of 100 mmol/L. The selectivity of PTL-channel was estimated from Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation by measurement of the reversal potential in an asymmetrical salt solution. The results showed that PTL-channels were cation selective."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Institute of Physiology, Academia Sinica."}], "LastName": "Shih", "ForeName": "Y L", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "W P", "Initials": "WP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "K Y", "Initials": "KY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Sheng Li Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "20730130R", "ISSNLinking": "0371-0874"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ion Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipid Bilayers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ion Channels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Bilayers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1377836"]}}]}
