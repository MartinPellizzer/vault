The prevalence of this disease in adults over 60 years was 9.6% in men and 18% in women. The therapeutic goals of this disease generally include pain relief with the least side effects, improvement of articular function and improvement of life, in which pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments are performed in different protocols. Due to the common side effects of pain relievers and complaints after invasive joint surgeries, there is a growing interest in the use of Traditional and Complementary protocols in OA treatment. In this paper, different sources of Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) were searched to obtain any evidence evaluating any medicinal plants in the management of OA. Over 250 effective medicinal plants for the treatment of OA have been introduced in these sources, and by searching electronic databases including PubMed and Scopus, we have found that of these plants, 39 have direct or indirect evidence in the treatment of this complication by different mechanism of actions such as effect on Body mass index (BMI), obesity and dyslipidemia, anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive and antioxidant activity. The most important medicinal plants with direct evidence in the management of OA are Allium sativum, Commiphora mukul, Linum usitatissimum, Matricaria chamomilla, Nigella sativa, Zingiber officinale, and Piper nigrum. Medicinal plants seem to be a valuable source for discovering and identifying new drugs for treatment of OA; however, since most of the studies are preclinical, further clinical trials are required to achieve more conclusive results."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Pharmacy, School of Persian Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Karami", "ForeName": "Soodeh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Pharmacy, School of Persian Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shamshiri", "ForeName": "Shiva", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abdollahi", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Pharmacy, School of Persian Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rahimi", "ForeName": "Roja", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Discov Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "101157212", "ISSNLinking": "1570-1638"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evidence-Based Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Persian"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoarthritis"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32178613", "10.2174/1570163817666200316105658", "CDDT-EPUB-105242"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
