Mathematically defined decline curves were established by determining optimal relationships between methamidophos residues and time, using different models. Model functions that best fit experimental data were 1st-order function for cucumber, 1.5th-order function for pepper, and 1st-order root function for tomato. However, in all cases, the 1st-order function was legitimized statistically. Half-life times determined from the optimal functions were 8.68 days (cucumber), 13.28 days (pepper), and 2.77 days (tomato), whereas half-life times determined from the 1st-order reaction function were 8.68 days (cucumber), 17.04 days (pepper), and 7.47 days (tomato). In this work, some experiments to determine residue levels of methamidophos in these vegetables after multiple applications were also carried out. The unexpected high residue levels found in all cases after five successive applications seem to indicate that methamidophos presents certain long-term accumulative effects in the three studied vegetables."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pesticide Residues Research Group, Facultad de Ciencias Experimentales, Universidad de Almer\u00eda, Spain."}], "LastName": "Aguilera-del Real", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Valverde-Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Camacho-Ferre", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organothiophosphorus Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8Z083FM94W", "NameOfSubstance": "methamidophos"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cucumis sativus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Half-Life"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Organothiophosphorus Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10552657", "10.1021/jf981407e", "jf981407e"]}}]}
