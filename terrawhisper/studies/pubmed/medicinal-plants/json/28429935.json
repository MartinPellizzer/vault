The main purpose of this paper was to investigate the liver protection activity of saponins (ginsenosides) from the leaves of Panax quinquefolius (PQS) against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity, and the involved mechanisms were demonstrated for the first time. Mice were pretreated with PQS (150 and 300 mg/kg) by oral gavage for 7 days before being treated with 250 mg/kg APAP. Severe liver injury was exerted at 24 h post-APAP, and hepatotoxicity was assessed. Our results showed that pretreatment with PQS significantly decreased the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) levels in a dose-dependent manner as compared to the APAP administration. Meanwhile, compared with that in the APAP group, PQS decreased hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) expression and restored reduced glutathione (GSH) content and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in livers of mice. PQS inhibited the overexpression of pro-inflammatory factors cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the liver tissues. Furthermore, Western blotting analysis revealed that PQS pretreatment inhibited the activation of apoptotic signaling pathways via increase of Bcl-2 and decrease of Bax and caspase-3 protein expression levels. Liver histopathological observation provided further evidence that PQS pretreatment significantly inhibited APAP-induced hepatocyte necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and congestion. Biological indicators of nitrative stress such as 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) were inhibited after PQS pretreatment, compared to the APAP group. The present study clearly demonstrates that PQS exerts a protective effect against APAP-induced hepatic injury because of its antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory activities. The findings from the present investigation show that PQS might be a promising candidate treatment agent against drug-induced ALI."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University , Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xing-Yue", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University , Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jun-Nan", "Initials": "JN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University , Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhi", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, CAAS , Changchun 132109, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jilin Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences , Changchun 130012, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Yu-Fang", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, CAAS , Changchun 132109, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, CAAS , Changchun 132109, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhi-Qing", "Initials": "ZQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University , Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ge", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2988-4298"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University , Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1beta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "362O9ITL9D", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetaminophen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Acetaminophen"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1beta"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28429935", "10.1021/acs.jafc.7b00610"]}}]}
