In this study, primary metabolites and secondary metabolites were compared in 1, 2 and 3 years old P. tenufolia cultivated in Shaanxi Heyang. The samples were subjected to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, and the obtained data were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and other statistical analysis methods. In addition, content and correlation of different metabolites were also calculated. The results showed no significance between main component contents in 2 year-old and 3 year-old P. Tenufolia, but 1 year-old was statistically different. The contents of primary metabolites, such as fructose, sucrose, and choline increased as time goes on, while glycine and raffinose decreased. The contents of secondary metabolites, such as onjisaponin Fg, polygalasaponin XXVIII, polygalasaponin XXXII increased, while polygalaxanthone III and parts of oligosaccharide multi-ester including tenuifoliose A, tenuifoliose C, tenuifoliose C2 and tenuifoliose H decreased with the extension of the growth years. Growth years has important impact on the quality of P. tenuifolia and the existing growing years of commodity P. tenuifolia have its scientific evidence. This study supplied a new method for the quality evaluation of Chinese medicinal materials."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao-wei", "Initials": "XW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhen-yu", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Zu-ping", "Initials": "ZP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Fu-sheng", "Initials": "FS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ai-ping", "Initials": "AP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Xue-mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polygala"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26118115"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
