The bioactive components in tea, such as polyphenols, polysaccharides, polypeptides, pigments, and alkaloids, are the main contributors to its health functions. Based on epidemiological surveys, the consumption of tea and its compounds in daily life has positive effects on cardiovascular diseases, cancers, hepatopathy, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. In experimental studies, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-obesity, cardiovascular protective, liver protective, and hypoglycemic activities of tea and the related mechanisms of action have been widely investigated. The regulation of several classical signaling pathways, such as nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), and wingless/integrated (Wnt) signaling, is involved. Clinical trials have also demonstrated the potential of tea products to be applied as dietary supplements and natural medicines. In this paper, we reviewed and discussed the recent literature on the health benefits of tea and its compounds, and specifically explored the molecular mechanisms involved."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
