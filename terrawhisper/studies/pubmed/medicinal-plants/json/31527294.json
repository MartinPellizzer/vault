Methods In the present review study, materials concerning asthma were assessed by the (most) reliable source of PM (Canon of Medicine) written by Avicenna. Recommended medicinal plants for treating asthma were extracted from this book. Likewise, the electronic databases were used for investigating the pharmacological properties of offered herbs. Results The signs and symptoms of \"Rabv\" discussed by Avicenna are very similar to the asthma in modern medicine. Avicenna dichotomized asthma causing into pulmonary and non-pulmonary ones, including asthma with the heart, liver, or stomach origin. Overall, 14 medicinal plants were mentioned for the treatment of asthma presented in Canon of Medicine, including celery, juniper, dodder, chamomile, fennel, quince seed, black caraway, lavender, hyssop, squill, anise, absinthe, asafoetida, and common polypody. Conclusions PM prescribes medicinal plants for treating asthma, based on each patient's symptoms and trigger factors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amini", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jaladat", "ForeName": "Amir Mohammad", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Atarzadeh", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Traditional Medicine and History of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mosavat", "ForeName": "Seyed Hamdollah", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Dermatology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Parvizi", "ForeName": "Mohammad Mahdi", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zamani", "ForeName": "Nasrindokht", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Complement Integr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101313855", "ISSNLinking": "1553-3840"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Arabic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31527294", "10.1515/jcim-2018-0148", "/j/jcim.ahead-of-print/jcim-2018-0148/jcim-2018-0148.xml"]}}]}
