The molecular mechanism of action of their bioactive molecules against various diseases or therapeutic targets is still being explored. Here, the active compounds (withanolides) of a well-known Indian medicinal herb, Ashwagandha (<i>Withania somnifera</i>), have been studied for their most potential therapeutic targets and their mechanism of action using ligand-based screening and receptor-based approaches. Ligand-based screening predicted the six top therapeutic targets, namely, Protein kinase C alpha (PRKCA), Protein kinase C delta (PRKCD), Protein kinase C epsilon (PRKCE), Androgenic Receptor (AR), Cycloxygenase-2 (PTGS-2) and Phosphodiesterase-4D (PDE4D). Further, when these predictions were validated using receptor-based studies, i.e. molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and free energy calculations, it was found that PDE4D was the most potent target for four withanolides, namely, Withaferin-A, 17-Hydroxywithaferin-A, 27-Hydroxywithanone and Withanolide-R. These compounds had a better binding affinity and similar interactions as that of an already known inhibitor (Zardaverine) of PDE4D. These results warrant further <i>in-vitro</i> and <i>in-vivo</i> investigations to examine their therapeutic potential as an inhibitor of PDE4D.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
