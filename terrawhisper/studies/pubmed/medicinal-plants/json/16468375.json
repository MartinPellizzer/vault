Using the method of seropharmacology, the drug-carried serum of the different parts of P. olerace were prepared. The cell viability of each group was tested by. Methy thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. The levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the supernatant of cultured adipose cell were assayed by RIA.", "MTT assay results showed the cell viability of normal serum group was significantly higher than that of high lipid serum( P < 0.05). Compared with the high lipid serum group, the cell viability of the drug-carried serum groups in 40% and 20% concentration were significantly increased( P < 0.05). The high lipid serum had a better effect on increasing the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 than the normal serum group (P < 0.01). Expect the drug-carried serum of P. olerace low dose group in 20% concentration, each drug-carried serum group could markedly lower the levels of TNF-alpha (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Each drug-carried serum group in 40% concentration and the drug-carried serum P. olerace MS high dose group in 20% concentration could markedly lower the levels of IL-6 (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).", "The drug-carried serum of P. olerace and its different parts act on adipose cell damaged by the high lipid serum, significantly increas the cell viability in the groups in 40% and 20% concentration, and improve the disorder of lipid in differeut degrel by lowering the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 that adipose cell secreted in vitro."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tongji Hospital, Tongii Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan 430030, China. xiaofengyinglh@sina.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Feng-ying", "Initials": "FY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Fu-er", "Initials": "FE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Li-jun", "Initials": "LJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adipocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavones"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperlipidemias"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-6"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Portulaca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Serum"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16468375"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
