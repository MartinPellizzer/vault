Samples (1 g) were extracted with 0.5% potassium chloride (KCl) in 70% methanol (5 ml) and diluted subsequently to give two-fold to ten-fold step-wise dilutions in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (PBS-T BSA). For extracts from the spices analysed, ELISA estimates of OA concentrations were compared with those made by HPLC. All estimates were within 1-2 standard deviation of the ELISA values. More than 90% of OA added to spice samples was recovered from samples containing between 5 and 100 microg/kg OA. Extracts of OA-free spice samples contained substances that interfered with ELISA, presumably because of non-specific reactions. This effect was avoided by preparing all the test solutions in extracts of OA-free spice samples. In 126 samples obtained from retail shops, OA was found to exceed 10 microg/kg in 14 (in the range of 15-69 microg/kg) of 26 black pepper samples, 20 (in the range of 10-51 microg/kg) of 50 coriander samples, two (23 microg/kg and 80 microg/kg) of 25 ginger samples and nine (in the range of 11-102 microg/kg) of 25 turmeric samples. This is the first record in India of the occurrence of OA in what are some of the most widely used spices in Indian cooking."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, Patancheru, Andhra Pradesh, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thirumala-Devi", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mayo", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reddy", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tangni", "ForeName": "E K", "Initials": "EK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Larondelle", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reddy", "ForeName": "D V", "Initials": "DV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Addit Contam", "NlmUniqueID": "8500474", "ISSNLinking": "0265-203X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mycotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ochratoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1779SX6LUY", "NameOfSubstance": "ochratoxin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IT942ZTH98", "NameOfSubstance": "Curcumin"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Food Addit Contam. 2003 Apr;20(4):417", "Note": "Emmanuel, KE [corrected to Tangni, EK]"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Curcumin"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zingiber officinale"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mycotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ochratoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Spices"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11552750", "10.1080/02652030117589"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
