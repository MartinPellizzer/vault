The aim of this work was to determine whether there is a relationship between hemorrhoids and certain food-related or common toxin-related factors.", "Two groups of 50 subjects were compared. Group I was composed of 50 patients with hemorrhoid symptoms. Fifty volunteers with no proctologic abnormality were included in group II. We used a diet survey to compare total calorie, protein, carbohydrate, fat, food fiber, water, alcohol, salt, pepper, pimento, tea, and coffee intake was well as smoking habits. Episodes of constipation were also noted.", "Overall calorie intake, as well as protein, carbohydrate and fiber intake were similar in the two groups as were use of salt, coffee and tea. Dietary intake in group I was higher for fat (p = 0.02), alcohol (p = 0.01), pepper (p = 0.04, and pimento (p = 0.001). Subjects in group I drank less water (p = 0.008), smoked more (p = 0.01) and were more often constipated (p < 0.001) than those in group II.", "Our findings provide further arguments suggesting that dietary imbalance or smoking could be involved in the development of hemorrhoids. These factors should be evaluated in appropriate dietary inquiries. Epidemiological surveys would be required to confirm their possible causal effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Service de Chirurgie digestive, H\u00f4pital Sainte-Marguerite, Marseille."}], "LastName": "Sielezneff", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Antoine", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "L\u00e9cuyer", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saisse", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thirion", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sarles", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sastre", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Y a-t-il une corr\u00e9lation entre les habitudes alimentaires et la maladie h\u00e9morro\u00efdaire?"}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Presse Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8302490", "ISSNLinking": "0755-4982"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coffee"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fats"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Chloride, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tea"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Coffee"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Constipation"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fats"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Intake"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feeding Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hemorrhoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Chloride, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spices"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9767961"]}}]}
