A loosely structured questionnaire was prepared to evaluate their obstetric knowledge and practices. Even if most healers appeared to be aware of such complications as breech presentation, retained placenta, and prolonged labor, the great majority believed evil forces, or excessive hot heat, or the mother's hot blood to be causes of such complications as postpartum hemorrhage, and the great majority still used incantations, or powdered herbal concoctions to treat any kind of pregnancy and delivery complication. Such traditional practitioners are undoubtedly partly responsible for the high infant morbidity and mortality; still, the psychological advantages of their presence during parturition has been well substantitated. Short courses of training in modern delivery and health care techniques, and in disease prevention, should be organized appropriate to the level at which such practitioners function."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["802942", "00083792"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Africa", "Africa South Of The Sahara", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "English Speaking Africa", "Health", "Health Personnel", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Midwives", "Nigeria", "Plants, Medicinal", "Research Methodology", "Sampling Studies", "Studies", "Surveys", "Training Programs", "Western Africa"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "6109675", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1981", "Month": "04", "Day": "24"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "08", "Day": "21"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0020-7292", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "18", "Issue": "4", "PubDate": {"Year": "1980"}}, "Title": "International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics", "ISOAbbreviation": "Int J Gynaecol Obstet"}, "ArticleTitle": "Perinatal care by traditional healer-midwives of Nigeria.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "295", "EndPage": "299", "MedlinePgn": "295-9"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["A group of 106 Yoruba traditional healers who practice midwifery were interviewed, by means of a semistructured questionnaire, regarding their knowledge of various aspects of perinatal care.
