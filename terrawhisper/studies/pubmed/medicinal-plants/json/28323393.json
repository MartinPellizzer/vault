The present study focused on the green synthesis of AgNPs from the aqueous leaf extract of Pouteria sapota in order to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo antidiabetic properties of this extract and the synthesized AgNPs.", "The AgNPs were biologically synthesized under ambient conditions from an aqueous leaf extract of P. sapota using the hot percolation method and were characterized using spectroscopic methods, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The in vitro antidiabetic activity of the aqueous leaf extract and AgNPs was confirmed by non-enzymatic glycosylation of hemoglobin, glucose uptake by yeast cells following exposure of cells to 5 or 10 mmol/L glucose solution, and inhibition of \u03b1-amylase. Further, in vivo antidiabetic activity was assessed in streptozotocin-induced rats. Rats were treated with aqueous leaf extract (100 mg/kg) or AgNPs (10 mg/kg) for 28 days. Following treatment, rats were killed for biochemical and histopathological analysis of kidney and liver samples.", "A significant reduction in blood sugar levels was noted in rats treated with leaf extract or AgNPs. Results of in vitro and in vivo analyses in rats treated with leaf extract or AgNPs show that both the extract and the biologically synthesized AgNPs have antidiabetic activity.", "The aqueous leaf extract of P. sapota and AgNPs exhibited efficient antidiabetic activity in the rat model of diabetes and therefore could have potential for development for medical applications in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, School of Biosciences and Technology, VIT University, Vellore, India."}], "LastName": "Prabhu", "ForeName": "Sathya", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, School of Biosciences and Technology, VIT University, Vellore, India."}], "LastName": "Vinodhini", "ForeName": "Shanmugam", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Annamalai University, Chidambaram, India."}], "LastName": "Elanchezhiyan", "ForeName": "Chakravarthy", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, School of Biosciences and Technology, VIT University, Vellore, India."}], "LastName": "Rajeswari", "ForeName": "Devi", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "J Diabetes", "NlmUniqueID": "101504326", "ISSNLinking": "1753-0407"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Diabetes. 2020 Jan;12(1):95. doi: 10.1111/1753-0407.13002", "PMID": "31854519"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pouteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28323393", "10.1111/1753-0407.12554"]}}]}
