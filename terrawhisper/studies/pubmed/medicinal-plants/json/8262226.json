After n-butanol extraction and ether precipitation, HPLC purification was accomplished using a poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) column which removes lipid and protein contaminations. The main components of protein contamination were two hydrophobic proteins of near 4 kDa molecular mass, the psaI and psbK gene products associated with PSI and PSII reaction centers, respectively. Purified subunit III as well as the unfractionated organic-solvent soluble preparation were used in a 45Ca(2+)-ligand blot assay known to detect high affinity Ca(2+)-binding sites in proteins. Polypeptides were separated with SDS-PAGE and were transferred onto PVDF membranes. Treatment of the membrane with 45CaCl2 in the presence of 10-fold excess of MgCl2 and 200-fold excess KCl led to the labeling of only the 8 kDa polypeptide. The Ca2+ binding was inhibited after derivatizing aqueously exposed carboxyl groups with a water soluble carbodiimide plus a nucleophile, after de-formylation of the N-terminal methionine, or with a subsequent treatment with La3+. Ca2+ binding was maximum at pH 7.5-8.5 and was greatly decreased at acidic pH. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide treatment (no nucleophile was added) of thylakoid membranes, which derivatizes the hydrophobically located Glu-61, decreased the electrophoretical mobility of isolated subunit III but did not inhibit the Ca2+ binding. The data indicate that the carbonyl group of the formylated N-terminal Met-1 and probably the carboxyl group of the subunit III C-terminal Val-81 provide some of seven essential oxygen ligands normally required for defining a Ca(2+)-binding site in proteins. It is probable, but not yet established that an oligomeric form of subunit III polypeptides is essential for forming the Ca(2+)-binding site. Based on the accepted models for the hairpin conformation of the subunit III, it does seem clear that the Ca(2+)-binding site can form on the lumenal side of the membrane in the functional CFo structure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907-1392."}], "LastName": "Zakharov", "ForeName": "S D", "Initials": "SD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ewy", "ForeName": "R G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dilley", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "FEBS Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "0155157", "ISSNLinking": "0014-5793"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Butanols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8PJ61P6TS3", "NameOfSubstance": "1-Butanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.3.14", "NameOfSubstance": "Proton-Translocating ATPases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "1-Butanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Butanols"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intracellular Membranes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proton-Translocating ATPases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8262226", "10.1016/0014-5793(93)81617-9", "0014-5793(93)81617-9"]}}]}
