Bark accumulated maximum amount of paclitaxel in almost all plants. Populations located at higher altitude tended to accumulate more paclitaxel than lower altitude plants. Seasons in which samples were collected and plant age have also been shown to affect paclitaxel accumulation. No effects of plant sex on paclitaxel content of the plants analyzed were observed. Significant differences in baccatin-III and 10-deacetylbaccatin III content were found to exist in the trees analyzed in this study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Advanced Study, Department of Botany, University of Calcutta, Calcutta, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mukherjee", "ForeName": "Swapna", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghosh", "ForeName": "Biswajit", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jha", "ForeName": "Timir B", "Initials": "TB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jha", "ForeName": "Sumita", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bridged-Ring Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Taxoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1605-68-1", "NameOfSubstance": "taxane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P88XT4IS4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Paclitaxel"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Bridged-Ring Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Paclitaxel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Structures"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taxoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Taxus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12221606", "10.1055/s-2002-33808"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
