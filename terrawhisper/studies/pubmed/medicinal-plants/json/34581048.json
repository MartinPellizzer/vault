The chemical structures of the isolated compounds were identified on the basis of physicochemical properties, spectroscopic analysis, as well as the comparisons with the data reported in literature. Nineteen compounds were isolated from the 90% ethanol extract of the stems and leaves of C. excavata, which were identified as methyl orsellinate(1), syringaresinol(2), lenisin A(3), scopoletin(4), osthenol(5), N-benzoyltyrarnine methyl ether(6), N-p-coumaroyltyramine(7), aurantiamide acetate(8), 1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde(9), furostifoline(10), clausenalansine E(11), 3-formylcarbazole(12), clausine L(13), clausine E(14), methyl carbazole-3-carboxylate(15), glycosinin(16), murrayafoline A(17), clausine H(18) and 2,7-dihydroxy-3-formyl-1-(3'-methyl-2'-butenyl)carbazole(19). Among these isolated compounds, compounds 1-11 were isolated from C. excavata for the first time, and compounds 1, 2 and 10 were isolated from the genus Clausena for the first time. In addition, this study evaluated the anti-rheumatoid arthritis activities of compounds 1-19 by measuring their anti-proliferative effects on synoviocytes in vitro according to MTS method. Compounds 10-19 displayed remarkable anti-rheumatoid arthritis activities, which exhibited the inhibitory effects on the proliferation of MH7 A synovial fibroblast cells with the IC_(50) values ranging from(27.63\u00b10.18) to(235.67\u00b12.16) \u03bcmol\u00b7L~(-1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jia-Ming", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Qin-Ting", "Initials": "QT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Wen-Qing", "Initials": "WQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Key Laboratory of Research and Development of Tropical Fruits and Vegetables of Haikou City, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yan-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Yan-Hui", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Reverse-Phase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clausena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Synoviocytes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34581048", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210429.203"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
