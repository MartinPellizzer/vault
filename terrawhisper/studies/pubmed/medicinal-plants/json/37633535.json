Lonicera japonica Thunb. is an important traditional Chinese medicine, and the flower development stage is an important factor that influences the quality of medicinal ingredients. In this study, transcriptomics and metabolomics were performed to reveal the regulatory mechanism of secondary metabolites during flowering of L. japonica. The results showed that the content of chlorogenic acid (CGA) and luteolin gradually decreased from green bud stage (Sa) to white flower stage (Sc), especially from white flower bud stage (Sb) to Sc. Most of the genes encoding the crucial rate-limiting enzymes, including PAL, C4H, HCT, C3'H, F3'H and FNSII, were down-regulated in three comparisons. Correlation analysis identified some members of the MYB, AP2/ERF, bHLH and NAC transcription factor families that are closely related to CGA and luteolin biosynthesis. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in hormone biosynthesis, signalling pathways and flowering process were analysed in three flower developmental stage."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
