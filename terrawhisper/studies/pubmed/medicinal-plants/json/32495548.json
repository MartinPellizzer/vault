Medicinal plants are closely related to the diversity and richness of rhizosphere microorganisms, and rhizosphere microorganisms in the rhizosphere of medicinal plants have important effects on the growth and development, yield, quality and resilience of medicinal plants. The reasonable and effective utilization of the principle of interaction between medicinal plants and rhizosphere microorganisms has practical guiding significance for promoting the growth of medicinal plants, enhancing the ability of resistance to diseases and resisting the invasion of pathogens. This paper reviewed the research status of medicinal plants and rhizosphere microorganisms in recent years, including the influence of medicinal plants on rhizosphere microorganisms, the influence of rhizosphere microorganisms on medicinal plants and the mechanism of interaction between medicinal plants and rhizosphere microorganisms. The problems existing in the study of medicinal plants and rhizosphere microorganisms and the direction for further study were also pointed out."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources and Traditional Chinese Medicine Chemistry, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine Wuhan 430065, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Zheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Xiu-Zhi", "Initials": "XZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources and Traditional Chinese Medicine Chemistry, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine Wuhan 430065, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources and Traditional Chinese Medicine Chemistry, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine Wuhan 430065, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Da-Hui", "Initials": "DH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources and Traditional Chinese Medicine Chemistry, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine Wuhan 430065, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Yang", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources and Traditional Chinese Medicine Chemistry, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine Wuhan 430065, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhizosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32495548", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200302.116"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
