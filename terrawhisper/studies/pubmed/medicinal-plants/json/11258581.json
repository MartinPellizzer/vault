A coating for implants which would further reduce the risk in man is desirable. The incidence in mice is much greater, and responds to chemical treatment of the implant surface. Coating with histones increases tumour yield. Accordingly, related substances, foreign DNA, DNase and a mixture of the two, were tested for anticancer activity by application to 25 mm nitrocellulose filters in groups of 30-45 BALB/c mice, in comparison with untreated filters. Other substances reported to influence neoplasia, paprika, beta-carotene, rhodamine and tuftsin; and substances expected to be neutral, oxyprenolol, liquid paraffin, iodine, and adenosine diphosphate were similarly tested against concurrent untreated controls for comparison. Bovine DNA (p = 0.01) and DNA/DNase mixture (p = 0.04) and DNase fomented tumour growth by 55, 45 and 59% respectively. Paprika and beta-carotene did so by 70% (p = 0.05). The other substances were inert. None were candidates for an anti-sarcoma coating."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental Medicine, National University of Ireland, Galway. sean.lavelle@nuigalway.ie"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lavelle", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iomhair", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Technol Health Care", "NlmUniqueID": "9314590", "ISSNLinking": "0928-7329"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coated Materials, Biocompatible"}, {"RegistryNumber": "01YAE03M7J", "NameOfSubstance": "beta Carotene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Deoxyribonucleases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Coated Materials, Biocompatible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cocarcinogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Deoxyribonucleases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Foreign Bodies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Prostheses and Implants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Sarcoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "beta Carotene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11258581"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
