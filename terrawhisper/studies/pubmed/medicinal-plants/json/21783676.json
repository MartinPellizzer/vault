One such plant is Datura stramonium (DS) (Solanaceae), used frequently as an anti-asmatic treatment. DS contains a variety of alkaloids including atropine and scopolamine that can cause anticholinergic poisoning if taken in large doses. Atropine and scopolamine act on the muscarinic receptors by blocking them (particularly the M(2) receptors) on airway smooth muscle and submucosal gland cells. However, this will cause a continuous release in acetylcholine (Ach). Ach also act on nicotinic receptors; however, it is known that \"over exposure\" of nicotinic receptors may cause desensitization. We suggest that exposure of the foetus to DS when a mother uses it for asthma, will cause a continuous release of Ach, resulting in the desensitizing of nicotinic receptors, this could ultimately result in permanent damage to the foetus. Therefore we conclude that this African herbal remedy should be used with caution during pregnancy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, School of Health Sciences, Medical Faculty of the University of Pretoria, Pretoria 0001, South Africa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pretorius", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marx", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Toxicol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9612020", "ISSNLinking": "1382-6689"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21783676", "10.1016/j.etap.2005.10.006", "S1382-6689(05)00185-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
