The addition of Temoe Lawak Singer to a high-cholesterol diet, but not a cholesterol-free diet, was found to lower both serum and liver cholesterol in rats. When the rats were fed Temoe Lawak Singer as 0.1, 0.5 or 1.0% (w/w) of the high-cholesterol diet for 22 days, serum cholesterol concentrations were lowered by 4, 10 and 19%, respectively. The lowest dose induced a 20-% decrease in liver cholesterol, and higher doses did not cause further reduction. The fecal excretion of bile acids was decreased by 1.0% of Temoe Lawak Singer in the diet. It is suggested that Temoe Lawak Singer taken at normal doses may lower serum cholesterol in man."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Beynen", "ForeName": "A C", "Initials": "AC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Artery", "NlmUniqueID": "7508494", "ISSNLinking": "0098-6127"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bile Acids and Salts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bile Acids and Salts"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osmolar Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3619667"]}}]}
