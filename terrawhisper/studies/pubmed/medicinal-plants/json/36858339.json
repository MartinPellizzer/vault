Targeting PORCN provides a promising approach to specifically cure Wnt-driven cancers from the root. In this study, we designed series of pyridonyl acetamide compounds, and discovered a novel PORCN inhibitor WHN-88 with a unique di-iodinated pyridone structural fragment, which is significantly different from the reported inhibitors. We demonstrated that WHN-88 effectively abolished palmitoylation of Wnt ligands and prevented their secretion and the subsequent Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling transduction. Further experiments showed that, at well-tolerated doses, WHN-88 remarkably suppressed the spontaneous occurrence and growth of MMTV-Wnt1 murine breast tumors. Consistently, WHN-88 also notably restrained the progress of xenografted Wnt-driven human tumors, including PA-1 teratocarcinoma with high autocrine Wnt signaling and Aspc-1 pancreatic carcinoma with Wnt-sensitizing RNF43 mutation. Additionally, we disclosed that WHN-88 inhibited cancer cell stemness obviously. Together, we verified WHN-88 is a novel PORCN inhibitor with potent efficacy against the Wnt-driven cancers. Our findings enriched the structural types of PORCN inhibitors, and facilitated the development and application of PORCN inhibiting therapy in clinic."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
