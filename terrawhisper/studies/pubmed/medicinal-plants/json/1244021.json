The alcohol extract produced maximum uterine contractions within 60 seconds. Relaxation of the effect of the alcohol extract was slower than that for the standard posterior pituitary extract. The aqueous extract had a slower onset of action than the alcohol extract and a quicker recovery period. Similar oxytocic activities were observed for 50 mg of powdered Cascuta in alcohol extract, 500 mg powdered Cascuta in aqueous extract, and 1 unit of posterior pituitary extract. In rat uteri, the alcohol extract showed marked and superimposed uterine contractions similar to ergot alkoids, and the relaxation time was very slow (12 minutes). In contrast, the aqueous extract had an effect similar to the posterior pituitary extract. The results are discussed."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["755104", "00039865"], "GeneralNote": [], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Abortifacient Agents", "Animals, Laboratory", "Biology", "Clinical Research", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Genitalia", "Genitalia, Female", "Health", "Health Services", "In Vitro", "Ingredients And Chemicals", "Medicine", "Physiology", "Plants, Medicinal--side effects", "Research Methodology", "Urogenital System", "Uterine Effects", "Uterus"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "1244021", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1977", "Month": "04", "Day": "25"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0377-9238", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "1", "Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1975", "Month": "Oct"}}, "Title": "Bangladesh Medical Research Council bulletin", "ISOAbbreviation": "Bangladesh Med Res Counc Bull"}, "ArticleTitle": "Oxytocic properties in extracts of Cascuta (a preliminary report).", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "72", "EndPage": "74", "MedlinePgn": "72-4"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mustafa", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Bangladesh", "MedlineTA": "Bangladesh Med Res Counc Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "7607686", "ISSNLinking": "0377-9238"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bangladesh"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Uterine Contraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1975", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1975", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1975", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1244021"]}}]}
