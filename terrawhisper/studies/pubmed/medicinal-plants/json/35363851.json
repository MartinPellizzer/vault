Regenerated plantlets were evaluated by HPLC analysis for contents of four valepotriates viz. valtrate, acevaltrate, didrovaltrate and IVHD valtrate.", "The highest shoot recovery (91.6%) after transfer to liquid nitrogen was obtained when shoot tips were treated with PVS2 at 0\u00b0C for 110 min, which was significantly higher than the highest recovery (73.3%) obtained using PVS3 for any duration tested. Evaluation of biosynthetic stability showed no variation in valepotriate contents between in vitro maintained and cryopreserved derived plantlets.", "This protocol will be useful for the long-term conservation of this species as high frequency recovery and biosynthetic stability after cryopreservation were obtained."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Panjab University, Chandigarh, 160 014, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Panjab University, Chandigarh, 160 014, India."}], "LastName": "Parasher", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Panjab University, Chandigarh, 160 014, India. pmukherjee@pu.ac.in."}], "LastName": "Mukherjee", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forest Products, Dr. YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, 173 230, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Y P", "Initials": "YP", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cryo Letters", "NlmUniqueID": "9891832", "ISSNLinking": "0143-2044"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cryopreservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Valerian"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vitrification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "15"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35363851"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
