The role of DDX20 in gastric cancer is still unknown. In the research, the expression of DDX20 and the functional roles of DDX20 in gastric cancer were detected. The increased DDX20 expression in gastric cancer tissue compared with normal gastric tissue was observed. Functional experiments indicated that DDX20 promoted gastric cancer MGC-803 and AGS cells growth, migration, and invasion in <i>vitro</i>. Surprisingly, survival analysis showed that high expression of DDX20 is a favorable prognostic factor for patients with gastric cancer. In addition, enrichment analysis revealed that there is a positive correlation between DDX20 expression and T cell activation in gastric cancer. but not in normal gastric tissues. Furthermore, we found that DDX20 expression level has significant positive correlations with activated CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and activated CD4\u00a0+\u00a0T cells in gastric cancer. Therefore, we hypothesize that the prognostic role of DDX20 in gastric cancer patients may be due to patients with high DDX20 expression contained better immune activation. Taken together, these findings suggest that DDX20 can promote the progression of gastric cancer in <i>vitro</i> and its prognostic value in gastric cancer may be related to many factors, including immune activation."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 The Author(s)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province 210000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of OptoElectronic Science and Technology for Medicine of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, Fujian Province 350117, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Engineering Technology Research Center of Characteristic Medicinal Plants of Fujian, Ningde Normal University, Ningde, Fujian Province 352100, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hepatic Drug Research, Fuzhou, Fujian Province 350014, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qingshui", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of OptoElectronic Science and Technology for Medicine of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, Fujian Province 350117, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology, Fujian Cancer Hospital & Fujian Medical University Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian Province 350014, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Rongbo", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of OptoElectronic Science and Technology for Medicine of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, Fujian Province 350117, China."}], "LastName": "Weng", "ForeName": "Shuyun", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of OptoElectronic Science and Technology for Medicine of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, Fujian Province 350117, China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Fan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of OptoElectronic Science and Technology for Medicine of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, Fujian Province 350117, China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of OptoElectronic Science and Technology for Medicine of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, Fujian Province 350117, China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Haitao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province 210000, China."}], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Lilin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of OptoElectronic Science and Technology for Medicine of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, Fujian Province 350117, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Laboratory at The Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Traditional Chinese Medical University, Collaborative Innovation Center for Rehabilitation Technology, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Fuzhou, Fujian Province 350014, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Yao", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Comput Struct Biotechnol J", "NlmUniqueID": "101585369", "ISSNLinking": "2001-0370"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "2015.
