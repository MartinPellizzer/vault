QTN oral consumption produces several biological effects, including antioxidant, cardioprotective, anti-apoptotic, anti-cancer, neuroprotection, anti-hypertensive, and chemo preventive.", "The study aimed to prepare Pluronic\u00aeF127/chitosan-myristic acid copolymer (PF127/C-MAc)-based mixed micelles (QTN MM) to improve the biopharmaceutical and hepatoprotective potential of QTN.", "QTN MM was developed employing thin-film hydration and optimized using full factorial design (FFD). Optimized QTN MM was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), powder x-ray diffractometry (PXRD), in vitro dissolution, ex vivo permeation, and in vivo antioxidant activity in carbon tetrachloride (CCL4)-induced albino rats.", "PF127/C-MAc ratio (1:1) with CMC value ~ 5 \u03bcg/mL showed the suitability for MM. Characterization supported the formation of MM. QTN MM revealed prominent encapsulation efficiency and drug loading of about ~ 95.10% and ~ 12.28% w/w, respectively. MM spherical shape of QTN with a smaller particle size of ~ 34.08 nm and a higher zeta potential of ~ 36.24 nm indicated excellent physical stability. Dissolution and ex vivo permeation results revealed higher dissolution and permeation of QTN MM compared to QTN and PM. In vivo antioxidant activity suggested that QTN MM at (~ 20 mg/kg, p.o.) restored the enhanced marker enzyme level compared to QTN.", "The findings demonstrate that developed QTN MM could be used as an alternative nanocarrier to increase the biopharmaceutical and hepatoprotective potential of QTN and other flavonoids."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3016-8237"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Datta Meghe College of Pharmacy, Datta Meghe Institute of Higher Education and Research (Deemed to be University), Sawangi (Meghe), Wardha442107, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Telange", "ForeName": "Darshan R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Quality Assurance, Smt.
