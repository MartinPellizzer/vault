The deduced protein sequence of <i>SmFLS</i> was 88.07% and 84.94% identical to homologs encoded by <i>StFLS</i> in <i>Solanum\u00a0tuberosum</i> and <i>SlFLS</i> in <i>S.\u00a0lycopersicum</i>, respectively. <i>SmFLS</i> contains typical DIOX_N and 2OG-Fe (II)_Oxy functional domains, as well as five strictly conserved amino acid residues (H223, D225, H279, R289, and S291) related to <i>FLS</i> enzyme activity. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that <i>SmFLS</i> had the closest genetic relationship with the <i>FLS</i> genes in potato and tomato. At a high temperature of 35\u00a0\u00b0C, the expression level of <i>SmFLS</i> was higher than that of the control in the same period, and it reached extremely significant levels on 15DAF and 20DAF, at which the eggplant peel color became lighter accordingly. Upon overexpression of <i>SmFLS</i> in eggplant, the flavonol content of transformed plants was significantly higher than that of untransformed plants, and the peel color was lighter than that of the control. The results indicate that <i>SmFLS</i> negatively regulates eggplant peel coloration under high temperature."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Research and Utilization of Ethnomedicinal Plant Resources of Hunan Province, Key Laboratory of Hunan Higher Education for Western Hunan Medicinal Plant and Ethnobotany, Huaihua University, Huaihua 418008, China."}], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Ling Ling", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Research and Utilization of Ethnomedicinal Plant Resources of Hunan Province, Key Laboratory of Hunan Higher Education for Western Hunan Medicinal Plant and Ethnobotany, Huaihua University, Huaihua 418008, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li Yun", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South Subtropical Crops Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Science, Zhanjiang, Guangdong 524091, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South Subtropical Crops Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Science, Zhanjiang, Guangdong 524091, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Genome", "NlmUniqueID": "8704544", "ISSNLinking": "0831-2796"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Pigmentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum melongena"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum tuberosum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "8"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33513076", "10.1139/gen-2020-0141"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
