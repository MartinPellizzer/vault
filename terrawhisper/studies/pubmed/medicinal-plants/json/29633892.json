Recently, has been studied regarding its therapeutic potential. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review on R. officinalis essential oil for its pharmacological properties and biotechnological applications.", "The databases were searched for articles (Science Direct, Pub Med and Web of Science) and patents (INPI, WIPO and EPO) with publications on R. officinalis and associations with essential oil (EO-Ro), cardiovascular system, hypertension and cyclodextrin. We selected 305 articles on EO-Ro in the most diverse subjects and six articles with of R. officinalis associated with hypertension. 59 patents were analyzed. The results demonstrate how extensive the studies are on the biological activities with the extract and EO-Ro. These have shown effects antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antitumor and other. The properties exhibited by EO-Ro reinforce the use of this plant as a phytotherapeutic agent.", "Although there are several pharmacological properties, studies on the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular diseases with EO-Ro are scarce, especially to evaluate the antihypertensive activity of EO-Ro. It has also become clear that EO-Ro can be exploited in different commercial products as supplement, cosmetics and new formulations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Postgraduate Program in Biotechnology - RENORBIO , Focal Point - Federal University of Piau\u00ed , Teresina , Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Medicinal Plants Research Center,Health Sciences Center , Federal University of Piau\u00ed , Teresina , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Neves", "ForeName": "Josynaria Ara\u00fajo", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Postgraduate Program in Biotechnology - RENORBIO , Focal Point - Federal University of Piau\u00ed , Teresina , Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Medicinal Plants Research Center,Health Sciences Center , Federal University of Piau\u00ed , Teresina , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Neves", "ForeName": "Josyanne Ara\u00fajo", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Postgraduate Program in Biotechnology - RENORBIO , Focal Point - Federal University of Piau\u00ed , Teresina , Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Medicinal Plants Research Center,Health Sciences Center , Federal University of Piau\u00ed , Teresina , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Oliveira", "ForeName": "Rita de Cassia Meneses", "Initials": "RCM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Expert Opin Ther Pat", "NlmUniqueID": "9516419", "ISSNLinking": "1354-3776"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patents as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rosmarinus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29633892", "10.1080/13543776.2018.1459570"]}}]}
