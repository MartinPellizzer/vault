Taxol productivity increased 19-fold when T. cuspidata suspension cultures were exposed to 5 ppm ethylene and 10 microM methyl jasmonate. This increase was 15-fold when either 0 or 10 ppm ethylene was combined with 10 microM methyl jasmonate. The induction of taxol occurred within 51 h after elicitation and would reduce fermentation times and costs. Ethylene concentration at 50 ppm had an inhibitory effect on taxol production but not on phosphate uptake rate, suggesting independent regulation of taxol and physiological functions of the cell. A simple induction model is proposed to explain the action and effects of both ethylene and methyl jasmonate with regard to receptor binding and regulatory systems in plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical & Bioresources Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80524, USA."}], "LastName": "Mirjalili", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Linden", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "5RO1 CA55138-04", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Prog", "NlmUniqueID": "8506292", "ISSNLinking": "1520-6033"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxylipins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "900N171A0F", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl jasmonate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "91GW059KN7", "NameOfSubstance": "ethylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P88XT4IS4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Paclitaxel"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxylipins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Paclitaxel"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stimulation, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8845101", "10.1021/bp9500831", "bp9500831"]}}]}
