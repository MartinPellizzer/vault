It is a life-altering neurological condition that significantly impacts individuals and their caregivers on a socioeconomic level. Recent advancements in medical therapy have greatly improved the diagnosis, stability, survival rates, and overall well-being of SCI patients. However, there are still limited options available for enhancing neurological outcomes in these patients. The complex pathophysiology of SCI, along with the numerous biochemical and physiological changes that occur in the damaged spinal cord, contribute to this gradual improvement. Currently, there are no therapies that offer the possibility of recovery for SCI, although several therapeutic approaches are being developed. However, these therapies are still in the early stages and have not yet demonstrated effectiveness in repairing the damaged fibers, which hinders cellular regeneration and the full restoration of motor and sensory functions. Considering the importance of nanotechnology and tissue engineering in treating neural tissue injuries, this review focuses on the latest advancements in nanotechnology for SCI therapy and tissue healing. It examines research articles from the PubMed database that specifically address SCI in the field of tissue engineering, with an emphasis on nanotechnology as a therapeutic approach. The review evaluates the biomaterials used for treating this condition and the techniques employed to create nanostructured biomaterials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
