The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of RA on inflammation and oxidative stress induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs were pre-treated with various contents of RA (20, 40, 80\u00a0\u00b5M) for 24\u00a0h, then, stimulated with LPS (10\u00a0ng/ml) for more 6\u00a0h. ELISA and Real-time PCR were done to detect the levels of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, COX-2, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10. Western blot was done to investigate the phosphorylated amounts of P65-NF-\u03baB and JNK. Inflammatory cytokines and oxidant-antioxidant parameters were determined by colorimetric and ELISA methods. The results indicated that LPS augmented the protein levels of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 cytokines as well as the mRNA levels of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, COX-2, and IL-10 cytokines in in PBMCs. However, pretreatment with RA could reduce the impact of LPS on inflammatory markers. In addition, RA inhibited P65-NF-\u03baB and JNK phosphorylation. LPS also caused a decrease in antioxidant enzymes, total thiol, and total antioxidant capacity as well as an increment in malondialdehyde and nitric oxide metabolite contents that RA abrogated them. Collectively, our finding demonstrated that RA ameliorates LPS-induced inflammation in PBMCs. RA reduces oxidative stress by preventing lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide production as well as restarting the activity of the GPx and SOD enzymes. Furthermore, our findings indicated that RA was able to protect PBMCs from inflammation via inhibiting the NF-\u03baB and JNK MAPK pathways. This evidence shows a promising therapeutic role for RA in inflammatory status."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghi", "ForeName": "Asie", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bastin", "ForeName": "Ali Reza", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghahremani", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9166-419X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran. amirhosseindoustimotlagh@gmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran. amirhosseindoustimotlagh@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Doustimotlagh", "ForeName": "Amir Hossein", "Initials": "AH"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "960098", "Agency": "Kerman University of Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mol Biol Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "0403234", "ISSNLinking": "0301-4851"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cinnamates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Depsides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factor RelA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Depsides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes, Mononuclear"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factor RelA"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rosmarinic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32350743", "10.1007/s11033-020-05447-x", "10.1007/s11033-020-05447-x"]}}]}
