However, ERT causes side effects, mainly breast cancer, uterine cancer and thromboembolic problems. Labisia pumila var. arata (LPva), a herb with phytoestrogenic effects has the potential to be used as an alternative agent to ERT. This study was conducted to determine the effects of LPva on bone biochemical markers and bone calcium content in ovariectomised rats.", "Thirty two Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups, with 8 rats in each group. The first group was sham operated (Sham), the second group was ovariectomised (OVX), the third (LPva) and fourth group (ERT) were also ovariectomised and given LPva 17.5 mg/kg and Premarin(\u00ae) 64.5 \u03bcg/kg, respectively. Blood samples were taken before and after treatment to measure osteocalcin and C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen levels using ELISA while the fifth lumbar bone samples were taken to measure bone calcium content using the Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS).", "The osteocalcin levels were significantly higher in both the LPva and ERT groups compared to the OVX group. The CTX levels were significantly lower in both the LPva and ERT groups compared to the OVX group. However, only the ERT group had significantly higher bone calcium level compared to the OVX group.", "The supplementation of 17.5 mg/kg of LPva to ovariectomised rats for 8 weeks was able to prevent the changes in bone biochemical markers but failed to prevent the bone calcium loss induced by ovariectomy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
