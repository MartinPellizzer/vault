As HM occupies an important position in its own right in global healthcare systems, robust quality assessment and control over its complex chemical composition was of great significance to assure its efficacy and safety. Over the past decades, the concept of HM chemical fingerprints aiming to obtain a comprehensive characterization of complex chemical matrices has become one of the most convincing tools for the quality assessment of HM. This review summarizes the recent analytical techniques used to generate HM chemical fingerprints, including chromatography, vibrational spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. The advantages, drawbacks, and the application scope of each technology have been scrutinized in an attempt to better understand the data analysis. Furthermore, HM fingerprints together with multivariate and multiway chemometrics methods used for different application domains, such as similarity, exploratory, classification, and regression analysis, have also been discussed and illustrated with a few typical studies. The article provides a general picture and workflow of fingerprinting analyses that have been used for the quality assessment of HM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
