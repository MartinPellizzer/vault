The results of multiple comparison and analysis showed that the number of dot ring and the length-width ratio of tuber were no different in G. elata f. glauca cultivation form. The coefficient of variation about the single tuber fresh weigh, ring spacing and belly button diameter was about 20%. The coefficient of variation about the length of the tuber, the width of the tuber, the thickness of the tuber, the length-width ratio of tuber and the number of dot ring was near 10%. The correlation analysis results showed that the single tuber fresh weigh and the length,the width and the thickness of the tuber were extremely significant positive correlated. The results of multiple stepwise regression analysis and path analysis showed that the length, the width and the thickness of the tuber were the main factors affecting the fresh weight of single tuber,which were the best agronomic traits on high yield of G. elata f. glauca. The length of the tuber,the width of the tuber and the thickness of the tuber, which would be used as indicators of the characteristics of high yield varieties in Zhaotong.
