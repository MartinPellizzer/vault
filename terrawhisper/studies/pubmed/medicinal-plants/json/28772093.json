The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of maternal metabolic status on the response of mouse ovaries to the environmental contaminants benzene and xylene, as well as to extracts of the medicinal plant yucca. Ovaries isolated from normal-lean and slightly obese mice were cultured with or without 0.1% benzene or xylene for 24 h. Similarly, ovaries isolated from normal-lean, slightly obese, and significantly obese mice were cultured for 24 h with or without an extract of Yucca shidigera (YS, 10 \u03bc g/mL). We found that the metabolic status did not influence the release of basal progesterone (P4), testosterone (T), or insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), but obesity influenced the effects of the environmental contaminants and YS. Benzene reduced P4 output in ovaries from obese but not normal-lean mice; it also reduced IGF-I (but not T) release from ovaries irrespective of the metabolic status. Xylene dramatically increased P4 and T (but not IGF-I) release by ovaries from normal-lean mice, but there were no changes in P4 and only small increases in T output in obese mice. YS increased P4 (but not T or IGF-I) release in normal-lean and slightly obese animal ovaries, whilst significant obesity was associated with a lack of P4 response to YS. Obesity might affect the basal ovarian release of T or IGF-I and increases the sensitivity of ovaries to the action of benzene but decreases their responsiveness to xylene and YS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Zoology and Anthropology, Constantine the Philosopher University, 949 74 Nitra, Slovakia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Genetics and Reproduction, Research Institute of Animal Production, 949 59 Lu\u017eianky, Slovakia."}], "LastName": "Sirotkin", "ForeName": "Alexander V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Institute of Animal Physiology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, 040 01 Ko\u0161ice, Slovakia."}], "LastName": "Fabian", "ForeName": "Du\u0161an", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Institute of Animal Physiology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, 040 01 Ko\u0161ice, Slovakia."}], "LastName": "Babel'ov\u00e1 Kubandov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Janka", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Anatomy, Histology, and Physiology, Institute of Physiology, University of Veterinary Medicine and Pharmacy, 041 81 Ko\u0161ice, Slovakia."}], "LastName": "Vl\u010dkov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Radoslava", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Zoology, College of Science, King Saud University, 11451 Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alwasel", "ForeName": "Saleh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Zoology, College of Science, King Saud University, 11451 Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Harrath", "ForeName": "Abdel Halim", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Appl Physiol Nutr Metab", "NlmUniqueID": "101264333", "ISSNLinking": "1715-5312"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3XMK78S47O", "NameOfSubstance": "Testosterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4G7DS2Q64Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Progesterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "67763-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin-Like Growth Factor I"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin-Like Growth Factor I"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ovary"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Progesterone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Testosterone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28772093", "10.1139/apnm-2017-0262"]}}]}
