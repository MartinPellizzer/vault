Huge amount of fern medicinal plants information is scattered in the form of text. Hence, database development would be an appropriate endeavor to cope with the situation. So by looking at the importance of medicinally useful fern plants, we developed a web based database which contains information about several group of ferns, their medicinal uses, chemical constituents as well as protein/enzyme sequences isolated from different fern plants. Fern ethnomedicinal plant database is an all-embracing, content management web-based database system, used to retrieve collection of factual knowledge related to the ethnomedicinal fern species. Most of the protein/enzyme sequences have been extracted from NCBI Protein sequence database. The fern species, family name, identification, taxonomy ID from NCBI, geographical occurrence, trial for, plant parts used, ethnomedicinal importance, morphological characteristics, collected from various scientific literatures and journals available in the text form. NCBI's BLAST, InterPro, phylogeny, Clustal W web source has also been provided for the future comparative studies. So users can get information related to fern plants and their medicinal applications at one place. This Fern ethnomedicinal plant database includes information of 100 fern medicinal species. This web based database would be an advantageous to derive information specifically for computational drug discovery, botanists or botanical interested persons, pharmacologists, researchers, biochemists, plant biotechnologists, ayurvedic practitioners, doctors/pharmacists, traditional medicinal users, farmers, agricultural students and teachers from universities as well as colleges and finally fern plant lovers. This effort would be useful to provide essential knowledge for the users about the adventitious applications for drug discovery, applications, conservation of fern species around the world and finally to create social awareness."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thakar", "ForeName": "Sambhaji B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ghorpade", "ForeName": "Pradnya N", "Initials": "PN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kale", "ForeName": "Manisha V", "Initials": "MV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Structural Bioinformatics Unit Department of Biochemistry, Shivaji University, Kolhapur 416 004, Maharashtra (M.S.), India. kds_biochem@unishivaji.ac.in."}], "LastName": "Sonawane", "ForeName": "Kailas D", "Initials": "KD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Comput Aided Drug Des", "NlmUniqueID": "101265750", "ISSNLinking": "1573-4099"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ferns"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26526709", "10.2174/1573409911666151103114738", "CCADD-EPUB-71550"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
