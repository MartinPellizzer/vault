To form the tubular basement membrane in the kidney, sulfate proteoglycans, collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and other glycoproteins congregate in the ECM. As an insecticide, diazinon (DZN) may alter the proportion of ECM by cholinesterase activity inhibition and oxidative stress. The naturally, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) plays an effective and therapeutic role in the treatment of toxicities and diseases in the body. In the current study, an attempt was made to evaluate the impacts of alpha-lipoic acid on the distribution of fibronectin and laminin in the renal tubules of male Wistar rats following exposure to diazinon. In this study, the animal groups comprised 30 adult male Wistar rats (almost three months old) randomly distributed into the following groups; control, DZN (40 mg/kg), DZN + ALA (40 mg/kg+100 mg/kg), ALA (100 mg/kg), and sham. The rats were anesthetized after six weeks. Blood sampling was performed, and kidneys were removed for immunohistochemistry study. Diazinon reduced the distribution of fibronectin and laminin and significantly inhibited cholinesterase activity in the renal tubules. Furthermore, urea and creatinine levels were higher in diazinon than in other groups. ALA in the co-treatment group enhanced cholinesterase activity and distribution of both glycoproteins in the renal tubules. Urea and creatinine levels were meaningfully diminished in the DZN + ALA group. The nephrotoxic effect of diazinon in vivo was the reduced distribution of laminin and fibronectin, probably induced by cholinesterase activity inhibition. As an antioxidant with specific properties, ALA reduces the nephrotoxic effects of diazinon by multifarious mechanisms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
