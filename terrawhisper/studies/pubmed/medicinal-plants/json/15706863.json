The glycyrrhizinic acid content in horizontal underground stem with the age below two years old or in random root with the diameter below 0.5 cm was low. The difference of glycyrrhizinic acid content among horizontal underground stem, random root and vertical underground stem was obvious, but the difference between horizontal underground stem and random root was not obvious.", "The horizontal underground stem was of G. uralnesis acts as a link that can connect random root, vertical underground and stem assimilating root, so that the whole underground part constructs one huge underground net system. The glycyrrhizinic acid accumulation is a effected by organ type, growth age, root diameter and grow position, and the distribution pattern of random root and vertical underground stem has influence on glycyrrhizinic acid distribution in horizontal underground stem."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Forestry University, Beijing 100083, China. szr67@126.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Zhi-rong", "Initials": "ZR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wen-quan", "Initials": "WQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Chang-hua", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Min-bin", "Initials": "MB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Yong-hong", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chang-li", "Initials": "CL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "6FO62043WK", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza uralensis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15706863"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
