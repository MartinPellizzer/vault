At present, efforts are underway to study its effects against various cancers at both the cellular and molecular levels. In this review, the role of active constituents like thymoquinone (TQ) on different types of cancer has been explored. TQ putative involvement in metastasis has been assessed by elucidating its effects on cell proliferation, adhesion, invasion and angiogenesis. Up regulation of caspase 3, Smac and down regulation of p-AKT, p65, XIAP, Bcl-2, COX-2 is also influenced by N. sativa. These findings prove a significant positive correlation between TQ concentrations and induction of apoptosis, decrease in motility and a reduction in invasion and angiogenesis in cancerous cells. However, there are still quite a few unaddressed domains, which need to be understood. One of these may include target specificity of N. sativa against cancerous tissues, mode of administration, dosage and downstream regulators in mediating these effects. In reference to earlier findings and low cost availability, N. sativa may, also, be suggested as either a suitable sole remedy for cancer or as a complementary to ongoing conventional therapy based extensive and rigorous in vivo optimization and validation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Sciences, National Textile University, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Arshad Malik", "ForeName": "Muhammad Sheraz", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Prophetic Medicine Application, King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Faculty of Medicine, King Abdulaziz University (KAU),Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA)."}], "LastName": "Al Jaouni", "ForeName": "Soad K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Prophetic Medicine Application, King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Faculty of Medicine, King Abdulaziz University (KAU),Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA)."}], "LastName": "Harakeh", "ForeName": "Steve M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, COMSATS-Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Arshad Malik", "ForeName": "Muhammad Faraz", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Metastasis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigella sativa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28476718"]}}]}
