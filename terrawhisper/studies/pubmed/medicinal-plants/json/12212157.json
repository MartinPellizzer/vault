All patients were treated with usual radiotherapy. The nasopharynx's radiation dose was 50-60 Gy, intracavitary irradiation 16 Gy/2 times (The distance from radiation source to spot of reference was 14 mm away). The radiation dose in EIC and SRT group was 68-72 Gy, respectively. The results were as follows: 1. There were no statistical difference among the three groups in 3-year or 5-year survival rate and no local relapse or distant metastasis. 2. The TCM alleviated the acute radiation reaction and damage effects. It indicates that the therapy might decrease radiation dose and the TCM does not induce NPC distant metastasis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xiangya Hospital, Hunan Medical University, Changsha 410008."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "J Y", "Initials": "JY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Hunan Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9424769", "ISSNLinking": "1000-5625"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cobalt Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "radiotherapy"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cobalt Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combined Modality Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "radiotherapy"], "DescriptorName": "Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Survival Rate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12212157"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
