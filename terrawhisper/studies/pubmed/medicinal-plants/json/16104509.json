The experimental animals were divided into 6 groups: control group, model group, SASP group (0.50 g/kg), KJK group (0.64, 0.32, 0.16 g/kg). The animals were administrated 0. 5% carboxymethyl cellulose, SASP and KJK respectively (from the 6th d after the establishment of ulcerative colitis model to the end of the experiment, 18 d totally). At the end of the experiment, the colon mucosal damage index (CMDI), the activity of myelperoxidase (MPO) and the occult blood test (OB) in feces were observed, the mucosa pathohistology was measured and thymus and spleen of rats were weighed respectively. Meanwhile, the content of malondiadehyde (MDA) , superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) of colonic tissue were detected.", "The remarkable effects of KJK at dosage of 0.64, 0.32 g/kg on TNBS-induced colitis were observed, the extent of CMDI and OB were decreased, MPO activeity of colonic tissue was reduced. The extent of atrophy of thymus gland and intumesce of spleen of rat were ameliorated. Meanwhile, the content of MDA was reduced, and the activities of SOD and GSH-Px were increased. Pathological histology results showed that KJK could alleviate the pathohistological lesion of the colon of rat.", "Treatment with KJK shows beneficial effects on the mucosal damage of rats colitis induced by TNBS/ethanol.
