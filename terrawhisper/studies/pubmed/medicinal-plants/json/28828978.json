This review presents the hairy root cultures approach for producing naphthoquinones and summarizes their most recent anti-cancer investigations.", "This review aimed to define biotechnological strategies impacted on naphthoquinones production in hairy root cultures. Up to now the major source of shikonin/alkannin derivatives, rhinacanthins and ramentaceone is isolation from plant material, also derived via biotechnological methods. Moreover, the most recent anti-cancer activity studies on naphthoquinones which could be produced in hairy root cultures were outlined.", "For databases survey two selection criteria were used: (i) naphthoquinone could be produced in hairy roots, and (ii) it exhibits anti-cancer properties.", "Ninety two papers were included in the review, thirty described biotechnological approaches enhancing naphthoquinones production, among them twenty seven were dedicated to hairy root cultures. Forty papers outlined the anti-cancer activity of targeted naphthoquinones including the type of cancer and bioassays description. The synergistic effect of natural naphthoquinones and other anti-cancer therapies was reviewed and toxicity of natural naphthoquinones and plant extracts was discussed. The review highlights tendencies in hairy root investigations and indicates the possible future research directions for improving biotechnological production efficacy.", "This review demonstrates a great potential of hairy root cultures for naphthoquinones production, which could be furtherly developed for future medical purposes, especially as anti-cancer agents. This area of plant biotechnology will be surely still developed with traditional and new strategies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biology and Medicinal Plants Biotechnology, Faculty of Pharmacy with the Laboratory Medicine Division, Medical University of Warsaw, Banacha 1, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Jeziorek", "ForeName": "Ma\u0142gorzata", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biology and Medicinal Plants Biotechnology, Faculty of Pharmacy with the Laboratory Medicine Division, Medical University of Warsaw, Banacha 1, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Syk\u0142owska-Baranek", "ForeName": "Katarzyna", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biology and Medicinal Plants Biotechnology, Faculty of Pharmacy with the Laboratory Medicine Division, Medical University of Warsaw, Banacha 1, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Pietrosiuk", "ForeName": "Agnieszka", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthoquinones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Agrobacterium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28828978", "10.2174/0929867324666170821161844", "CMC-EPUB-85398"]}}]}
