The major allergen of this pollen, Pla l 1, is recognized by the specific IgE from more than 80% of plantain-sensitive patients. It displays significant sequence homology with the major olive-pollen allergen Ole e 1. The objective was to develop a monoclonal antibody-based ELISA to quantify Pla l 1, and to assess the correlation of Pla l 1 content with the biologic activity of plantain pollen extracts. We also aimed to establish the specificity of the monoclonal antibodies against the potentially cross-reactive allergen Ole e 1, and to investigate the presence of Pla l 1-like proteins in psyllium and melon that have been reported to cross-react with P. lanceolata pollen.", "After fusion of myeloma cells with spleen cells from a BALB/c mouse, two Pla l 1-specific monoclonal antibodies secreting hybridomas were selected, and the antibodies characterized. One of them (2A10) was used as the capture antibody in an ELISA for Pla l 1 quantitation. An anti-P. lanceolata rabbit serum was used as the second antibody. Pla l 1 was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and used as the standard in the assay.", "The ELISA developed was highly reproducible and sensitive, with a detection limit of 0.1 ng/ml, and a practical working range of 0.4-12 ng/ml. The specificity was demonstrated against a large battery of allergens, including Ole e 1. The concentration of Pla l 1 was measured in 19 extracts of P. lanceolata pollen, and a good correlation was observed between the Pla l 1 content and the allergenic activity of the extracts. Pla l 1 was not detected in psyllium or melon extracts.", "The results prove the usefulness of the Pla l 1-ELISA for the standardization of extracts of P. lanceolata pollen intended for clinical use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research and Development Department, ALK-Abell\u00f3, Madrid, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Calabozo", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duffort", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carpizo", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barber", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Polo", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Validation Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Allergy", "NlmUniqueID": "7804028", "ISSNLinking": "0105-4538"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Affinity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cucurbitaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoblotting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11350307", "10.1034/j.1398-9995.2001.056005429.x", "all972"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
