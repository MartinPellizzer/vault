Don) DC., 'Spikenard' or 'Jatamansi', a highly valued, aromatic herb from alpine Himalayas has a long history of use as ethnomedicine and dietary supplements in Ayurveda, Unani and Chinese system of medicine since Vedic ages (1000-800 BC). In Ayurveda and traditional system of medicine, the species is used as stimulant, sedative, brain tonic or mind rejuvenator, antidiabetic, cardio tonic, and in the treatment of various neurological disorders such as insomnia, epilepsy, hysteria, anxiety and depression. It is considered as Sattvic herb in Ayurveda and is now commercially marketed either as single or poly-herbal formulations by many companies in national and international markets.", "The species has become threatened in its natural habitats due to over exploitation and illegal trade of its rhizomes for drug preparation in herbal and pharmaceutical industries. Considering the increasing demand and tremendous medicinal importance of this threatened plant species, a detailed study was undertaken to evaluate its antioxidant potential, secondary metabolite profiling, cytotoxicity, anti-inflammatory potential and in vitro enzyme inhibitory activities on key enzymes linked to hyperglycemia, hypertension and cognitive disorders in different plant parts of wild and in vitro-raised plants with respect to different solvent systems for its sustainable utilization.", "Anti-cholinesterase activity of leaves and rhizome of wild and cultured plant extracts was investigated against both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) enzymes. In vitro anti-hyperglycemic (\u03b1-amylase and PTP1B), anti-hypertensive (angiotensin-converting enzyme), anti-tyrosinase and anti-inflammatory potential (5-lipoxygenase and hyaluronidase) of different plant parts of wild and in vitro-raised plants with respect to different solvent systems were also evaluated. In vitro cytotoxic effect of rootstock extracts of wild and in vitro-derived plants were against cancer (HCT-116, MCF-7 and OE33) and two normal (HEK and MEF) cell lines. Secondary metabolite profiling of rhizome segments of wild and in vitro-derived plants was carried out by quantitative gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).", "In vitro-raised plantlets showed comparative higher yield of various secondary metabolites with a significantly high antioxidant activity as compared to the wild plants. Methanolic rootstock extracts of both wild and in vitro-derived plants of N. jatamansi exhibited significant AChE (IC<sub>50</sub> 36.46\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.1 and 31.18\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.6\u202f\u00b5g/ml, respectively) and BuChE (IC<sub>50</sub> 64.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.5 and 60.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.6\u202f\u00b5g/ml, respectively) inhibitory potential as compared to standard inhibitor galanthamine (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.94\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.03 and 4.45\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5\u202f\u00b5g/ml). Methanolic rootstock extract of in vitro-derived plants showed significant \u03b1-amylase (IC<sub>50</sub> 90.69\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.1\u202f\u00b5g/ml), PTP1B (IC<sub>50</sub> 24.56\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8\u202f\u00b5g/ml), angiotensin-converting enzyme (IC<sub>50</sub> 42.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.6\u202f\u00b5g/ml) and tyrosinase (IC<sub>50</sub> 168.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.6\u202f\u00b5g/ml) inhibitory potential as compared to standard acarbose (IC<sub>50</sub> 52.36\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.1\u202f\u00b5g/ml), ursolic acid (IC<sub>50</sub> 5.24\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8\u202f\u00b5g/ml), captopril (IC<sub>50</sub> 32.36\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.5\u202f\u00b5g/ml) and kojic acid (IC<sub>50</sub>\u202f=\u202f54.44\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.3\u202f\u00b5g/ml). Both the methanolic rootstock and leaf extracts of tissue culture-derived plants exhibited promising anti-5-LOX and anti-hyaluronidase activities against the known inhibitor of 5-LOX and hyaluronidase. Furthermore, methanolic rootstock extracts of both wild and in vitro-derived plants exhibited promising cytotoxic effects to HCT-116, MCF-7 and OE33 cell lines as compared to the normal HEK and MEF after 12\u202fh of treatment. Secondary metabolite profiling of wild and in vitro-derived plants by quantitative GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of different classes of terpenoids and phenolic acids might be responsible for its effective biological activities.", "In vitro-derived plants revealed a substantial anti-cholinesterases, anti-hyperglycemic anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive and anti-tyrosinase potential with higher yield of various bioactive metabolites and significantly higher antioxidant activity which substantially explain medicinal importance of N. jatamansi in traditional medicine, used for centuries in different Ayurvedic formulations. The present findings suggest that cultured plants could be a promising alternative for the production of bioactive metabolites with comparative biological activities to the wild plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier GmbH.
