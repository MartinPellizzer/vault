The essential oils have been found to have antiparasitic, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant and especially antibacterial activity including antibacterial activity against tuberculosis. In this study the chemical composition and anti-TB activity of essential oil extracted from <i>Levisticum officinale</i> has been evaluated.", "The essential oil of <i>L. officinale</i> was obtained by the hydro distillation method and the oil was analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS techniques. The antibacterial activity of essential oil was evaluated through Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) assay using micro broth dilution method against multidrug-resistant <i>Maycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. The molecular modeling of major compounds was evaluated through molecular docking using Auto Dock Vina against-2-trans-enoyl-ACP reductase (InhA) as key enzyme in <i>M. tuberclosis</i> cell wall biosynthesis.", "The hydrodistillation on aerial parts of <i>L. officinale</i> yielded 2.5% v/w of essential oil. The major compounds of essential oil were identified as \u03b1-terpinenyl acetate (52.85%), \u03b2- phellandrene (10.26%) and neocnidilide (10.12%). The essential oil showed relatively good anti-MDR <i>M. tuberculosis</i> with MIC = 252 \u03bcg/ml. The results of Molecular Docking showed that affinity of major compounds was comparable to isoniazid.", "The essential oil of aerial parts extracted from <i>L. officinale</i> was relatively active against MDR <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, and molecular docking showed the major compounds had high affinity to inhibit 2-trans-enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) as an important enzyme in <i>M. tuberculosis</i> cell wall biosynthesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran."}], "LastName": "Miran", "ForeName": "Mansour", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Thoracis Research Center, Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Feizabadi", "ForeName": "Mohammad Mehdi", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kazemian", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathobiology, Division of Microbiology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kardan-Yamchi", "ForeName": "Jalil", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Monsef-Esfahani", "ForeName": "Hamid Reza", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ebrahimi", "ForeName": "Samad Nejad", "Initials": "SN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Iran J Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "101518404", "ISSNLinking": "2008-3289"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Taiwo MO, Adebayo OS.
