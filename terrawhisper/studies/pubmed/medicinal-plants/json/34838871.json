The seed and its extracts have also been increasingly reported as a successful therapeutic agent with efficacy often attributed to the presence of the powerful antioxidant, thymoquinone. However, quantitative analysis of the seed (especially the volatile fraction) yields widely variable results, which may be due to one or a combination of different crop origins or possible varietal differences, contamination/adulteration, method of extraction, stage of maturation of the extracted seed and other factors. Nonetheless, despite the reported wide variability in bioactive constituents, many publications cite quantifiable outcomes in in vitro and in vivo toxicity testing and in clinical trials. There are a few reports describing allergic reactions in humans when N. sativa extracts are applied to the skin. Notwithstanding the foregoing, N. sativa seeds, used as a food ingredient at historical levels of consumption and as traditionally practiced are safe and Generally Recognized As Safe."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
