This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 60 patients with PD. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups to receive either 1000\u00a0mg omega-3 fatty acids from flaxseed oil plus 400 IU vitamin E supplements (n\u00a0=\u00a030) or placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a030) for 12 weeks. Unified Parkinson's disease rating stage (UPDRS) were recorded at baseline and the after 3-month intervention. After 12 weeks' intervention, compared with the placebo, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation led to a significant improve in UPDRS (-3.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.0 vs.\u00a0+4.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.9, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Furthermore, co-supplementation decreased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (-0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6 vs.\u00a0+0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and increased total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (+65.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a068.7 vs.\u00a0+16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a052.4\u00a0\u03bcmol/L, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and glutathione (GSH) concentrations (+41.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a080.6 vs.\u00a0-19.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a055.9\u00a0\u03bcmol/L, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) compared with the placebo. Additionally, co-supplementation meaningfully decreased insulin (-2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9 vs.\u00a0+1.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.2 \u03bcIU/mL, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01), homeostasis model of assessment-estimated insulin resistance (-0.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8 vs.+0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and Beta cell function (-5.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.9 vs.\u00a0+5.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025.5, P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), and increased quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (+0.009\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 vs.\u00a0-0.006\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03, P\u00a0=\u00a00.03) compared with the placebo. Overall, our study demonstrated that omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation in people with PD had favorable effects on UPDRS, hs-CRP, TAC, GSH and markers of insulin metabolism."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
