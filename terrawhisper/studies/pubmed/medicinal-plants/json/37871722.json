Acid invertase (AINV), a widely distributed enzyme that has been demonstrated to play a significant role in response to environmental stresses. However, the identification of the AINV gene family in D. huoshanense, the collinearity between relative species, and the expression pattern under external stress have yet to be resolved. We systematically retrieved the D. huoshanense genome and screened out four DhAINV genes, which were further classified into two subfamilies by the phylogenetic analysis. The evolutionary history of AINV genes in D. huoshanense was uncovered by comparative genomics investigations. The subcellular localization predicted that the DhVINV genes may be located in the vacuole, while the DhCWINV genes may be located in the cell wall. The exon/intron structures and conserved motifs of DhAINV genes were found to be highly conserved in two subclades. The conserved amino acids and catalytic motifs in DhAINV proteins were determined to be critical to their function. Notably, the cis-acting elements in all DhAINV genes were mainly relevant to abiotic stresses and light response. In addition, the expression profile coupled with qRT-PCR revealed the typical expression patterns of DhAINV in response to diverse abiotic stresses. Our findings could be beneficial to the characterization and further investigation of AINV functions in Dendrobium plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
