The system is applicable to oxidative rearrangement of tetrahydro-\u03b2-carbolines, tetrahydrocarboline oxidation to \u03b1-alkoxy carbazoles and spirooxindoles, and Witkop oxidation. Mechanistic experiments indicated that a single-electron oxidation process is responsible for the tunable selectivity control. This copper-catalysis protocol represents a significant advance in the field of indole oxidation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University; The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang, 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University; The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang, 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Rui-An", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5428-9661"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University; The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang, 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University; The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang, 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Jun-Rong", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University; The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang, 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Chi", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University; The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang, 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Wei-Dong", "Initials": "WD"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8188-1561"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University; The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang, 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Hai", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Org Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "100890393", "ISSNLinking": "1523-7052"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbolines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35503733", "10.1021/acs.orglett.2c01059"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
