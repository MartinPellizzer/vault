Sham-operation was performed in control rats. The BDL rats were randomly divided into two groups: the BDL group and the Huangqi decoction group. Huanqi decoction was given intragastrically for 4 weeks. At the end of the fifth week after BDL, animals were sacrificed.", "Compared with the sham control group, mortality rate in BDL group was 33.3% and incidence rate of ascites was 90%, and hepatic function was abnormal in most of the rats in BDL group. The number of Hepatocytes was decreased and the number of cholangiocytes significantly increased in BDL group. In addition, Hyp content of liver tissue and protein expression of CK 7 and a-SMA were significantly increased. Immunostaining indicated that CK 7 and a-SMA were co-localized in BDL group. These changes were markedly suppressed by the Huangqi decoction.", "These observations suggest that Huangqi decoction can inhibit cholangiocyte proliferation and cholangiocyte transdifferentiation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Liver and Kidney Diseases, Ministry of Education, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "DU", "ForeName": "Jin-Xing", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Bing-Feng", "Initials": "BF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Ming-Yu", "Initials": "MY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Gao-Feng", "Initials": "GF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "9710009", "ISSNLinking": "1007-3418"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Actins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Keratin-7"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9004-61-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Hyaluronic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "922OP8YUPF", "NameOfSubstance": "Huang Qi"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Actins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Astragalus Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Astragalus propinquus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bile Ducts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Transdifferentiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hyaluronic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Keratin-7"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20128962", "10.3760/cma.j.issn.1007-3418.2010.01.004", "cma.j.issn.1007-3418.2010.01"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
