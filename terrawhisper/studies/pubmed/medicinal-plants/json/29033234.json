Plants represent a viable platform for such endeavors owing to their traditional relevance in infectious disease therapies as well as their vast chemical resources. As many as fifty different species of the Amaryllidaceae are discernible with such functions in traditional medicine, thirty-nine of which have been subjected to pharmacological evaluations. Submicromolar antibacterial activities for several of these plants have been the driving force behind studies targeting their active constituents. This review accounts for close to a hundred of such entities, mainly isoquinoline alkaloids, which have been the focus in assays of thirty different bacterial pathogens. Promising activities were detected in several instances, although disappointingly the submicromolar level could not be breached. Also considered are structure-activity relationships which have emerged within the various groups of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
