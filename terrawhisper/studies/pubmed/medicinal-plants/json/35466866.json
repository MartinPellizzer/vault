Glycosyltransferases transfer a sugar moiety from uridine diphosphateactivated sugar molecules to an acceptor flavonoid via C-O and C-C linkages. Compared with O-glycosyl flavonoids, C-glycosyl flavonoids are more stable, resistant to glycosidase or acid hydrolysis, exhibit better pharmacological properties, and have received more attention. In this study, we discuss the mining of C-glycosyl flavones and the corresponding C-glycosyltransferases and evaluate the differences in structure and catalytic mechanisms between C-glycosyltransferase and O-glycosyltransferase. We conclude that promiscuity and specificity are key determinants for general flavonoid C-glycosyltransferase engineering and summarize the C-glycosyltransferase engineering strategy. A thorough understanding of the properties, catalytic mechanisms, and engineering of C-glycosyltransferases will be critical for future biotechnological applications in areas such as the production of desired C-glycosyl flavonoids for nutritional or medicinal use."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National \"111\" Center for Cellular Regulation and Molecular Pharmaceutics, Key Laboratory of Fermentation Engineering (Ministry of Education), Hubei Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology, Hubei Provincial Cooperative Innovation Center of Industrial Fermentation, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan 430068, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Hui-Yao", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National \"111\" Center for Cellular Regulation and Molecular Pharmaceutics, Key Laboratory of Fermentation Engineering (Ministry of Education), Hubei Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology, Hubei Provincial Cooperative Innovation Center of Industrial Fermentation, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan 430068, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National \"111\" Center for Cellular Regulation and Molecular Pharmaceutics, Key Laboratory of Fermentation Engineering (Ministry of Education), Hubei Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology, Hubei Provincial Cooperative Innovation Center of Industrial Fermentation, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan 430068, China."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Fei-Fan", "Initials": "FF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National \"111\" Center for Cellular Regulation and Molecular Pharmaceutics, Key Laboratory of Fermentation Engineering (Ministry of Education), Hubei Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology, Hubei Provincial Cooperative Innovation Center of Industrial Fermentation, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan 430068, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Li-Wen", "Initials": "LW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National \"111\" Center for Cellular Regulation and Molecular Pharmaceutics, Key Laboratory of Fermentation Engineering (Ministry of Education), Hubei Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology, Hubei Provincial Cooperative Innovation Center of Industrial Fermentation, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan 430068, China."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Kai-Zhi", "Initials": "KZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Microbial Technology, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Ya-Jie", "Initials": "YJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sugars"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosyltransferases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycosylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sugars"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "57"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35466866", "10.2174/1381612828666220422085128", "CPD-EPUB-122775"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
