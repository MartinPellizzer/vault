We sequenced the complete chloroplast (cp) genome of <i>G. parviflora</i>. The cp genome obtained was a circular DNA molecule of 159,825\u2009bp in length, containing one large and one small single copy region (LSC and SSC) of 87,517 and 18,352\u2009bp separated by a pair of 26,978\u2009bp inverted repeat regions (IRs). The overall GC content of the cp genome was 38.40%. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that <i>Glycosmis</i> was strongly supported as a monophyletic group belonging to Clauseneae, and <i>G. parviflora</i> was closely related to <i>G. pentaphylla</i>. The results will provide the basis for the further study of molecular markers and phylogeny of <i>G. parviflora</i>."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
