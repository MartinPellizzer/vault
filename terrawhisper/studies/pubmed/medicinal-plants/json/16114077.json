Numerous central and peripheral neural circuits control sexual activity. Impairment of one or more of these functional circuits may have a significant impact on personal, social and biological relationships. Although several aspects of sexual motivation and performance are known, a complete picture of the various factors that control human sexual activity is still unknown. The available drugs and treatments have limited efficacy, unpleasant side effects and contraindications in certain disease conditions. A variety of botanicals are known to have a potential effect on the sexual functions, supporting older claims and offering newer hopes. This review, while evaluating various factors that control sexual function, identifies a variety of botanicals that may be potentially useful in treating sexual dysfunction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plummer Movement Disorders Center, Department of Neurology, Scott and White Clinic and the Texas A&M University System, Health Science Center College of Medicine, Temple, Texas 76508, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tharakan", "ForeName": "Binu", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manyam", "ForeName": "Bala V", "Initials": "BV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological"}], "NumberOfReferences": "52"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16114077", "10.1002/ptr.1634"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
