Dental fluorosis was recorded under field conditions using the Thylstrup and Fejerskov index (TFI). The score on tooth 21 was used to indicate the severity. The prevalence of dental fluorosis in Moshi at TFI score > or =1 was 60% and at TFI score > or =5 it was 10%. The corresponding values in Kibosho were 100% and 34%, respectively. Background variables pertained primarily to the child's first 6 years of life. In Moshi and Kibosho, 65% and 97% of children, respectively, used magadi, a fluoride-containing food tenderizer. In Moshi, the risk of having TFI score > or =2 was significantly higher among users of magadi (odds ratio (OR) = 5). Kiborou, a traditional homemade weaning food (porridge) cooked with magadi, was used only in Kibosho. Users of kiborou (36%) were at significantly higher risk (OR = 3) of developing fluorosis at severity TFI > or =4 than the users of lishe, another type of weaning food. All children in Moshi and 64% in Kibosho used lishe, which is cooked without magadi. Magadi and kiborou were significant risk indicators. Thus, it seems that the unexpectedly high prevalence of dental fluorosis and the observed differences in fluorosis prevalence and severity may be partly explained by F exposure from magadi."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Odontology, Faculty of Dentistry and Center for International Health, University of Bergen, Norway. aminmohamed.awadia@odont.uib.no"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Awadia", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bjorvatn", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Birkeland", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haugejorden", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Sweden", "MedlineTA": "Acta Odontol Scand", "NlmUniqueID": "0370344", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6357"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Food Additives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8MDF5V39QO", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Bicarbonate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q80VPU408O", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arachis"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Carbonates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chi-Square Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feeding Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fish Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorides"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorosis, Dental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Food Additives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odds Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Bicarbonate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tanzania"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weaning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zingiberales"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10809392", "10.1080/000163500429352"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
