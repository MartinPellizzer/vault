Their regular porous structure ensures the proper support for cell attachment, proliferation, differentiated function, and migration. Techniques to fabricate a scaffold include leaching, freeze-drying, supercritical fluid technology, thermally induced phase separation, rapid prototyping, powder compaction, sol-gel, and melt molding. Gene delivery from the scaffold represents a versatile approach to influence the environment for managing cell function. Scaffolds can be used for various tissue engineering purposes, e.g. bone formation, periodontal regeneration, cartilage development, artificial corneas, heart valves, tendon repair, or ligament replacement. Moreover, they are also instrumental in cancer therapy, inflammation, diabetes, heart disease, and wound dressings. Scaffolds provide a platform to extend the delivery of drugs and genetic materials at a controlled timeframe, besides potentially being used to prevent infection upon surgery and other chronic diseases, provided that they can be formulated with specific medicines. This review discusses the need to design advanced functional scaffolds with the potential for modified drug delivery and tissue engineering in a synergistic approach.
