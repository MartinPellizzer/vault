Astragalin, a flavonoid widely found in a variety of edible and medicinal plants, is recorded to possess multiple biological and pharmacological activities. However, its effect of anti-breast cancer has been unknown.", "Computational pharmacology was employed to explore the potential mechanism of anti-metastasis and anti-angiogenesis effects of Astragalin on breast cancer. The targets of Astragalin were obtained from TCMSP, Swiss Target Prediction, SEA, BATMAN-TCM, ChemMapper and STITCH databases, and targets of breast cancer were got from OMIM, GeneCards, and DisGeNET databases. Protein-protein interaction network (PPI), Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed to elucidate the interactions of these two groups of targets. Moreover, the anti-metastasis and anti-angiogenesis effects of Astragalin were validated by in vitro and in vivo experiments using wound healing assay, transwell migration and invasion assay, gelatin zymography assay, tube formation assay, and chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane model.", "Computational pharmacology analysis indicated that the effects of Astragalin against breast cancer were mainly related to the regulation of the cell movement, migration, and angiogenesis, and taking AKT, ZEB1, VEGF, and MMP9 as the promising targets. Further experimental pharmacology indicated that Astragalin exerted anti-metastasis and anti-angiogenesis activities on breast cancer, and verified AKT, ZEB1, VEGF, and MMP9 as the key targets.", "Astragalin suppresses the metastasis and angiogenesis of breast cancer, and AKT, ZEB1, VEGF, and MMP9 are the promising targets for Astragalin against breast cancer. Thus, Astragalin is a potential therapeutic agent for breast cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
