Dracaena cochinchinensis (Lour.) S.C.Chen is the only plant defined by the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China as a source of dragon's blood.", "We aimed to reveal genes involved in the biosynthesis and accumulation of flavonoids of D. cochinchinensis which is under wounding stress by performing a de novo transcriptome analysis.", "D. cochinchinensis samples were collected for transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis at 0 days (0\u00a0d), 3 days (3\u00a0d), 6 days (6\u00a0d), and 10 days (10\u00a0d) after induction wounding stress, and tissues were microscopically observed after wounding stress.", "A total of 63,244 unigenes were obtained through bioinformatics analysis, and genes associated with the biosynthesis of flavonoids were identified. Through the analysis of DEGs after wounding stress in D. cochinchinensis, based on gene expression consistent with flavonoid accumulation levels, 20 genes in connection with the flavonoid synthesis pathway and 56 genes that may be responsible for flavonoid modification and transport, and also revealed TFs (MYB, bHLH) that may be responsible for flavonoid biosynthesis. Analysis of DEGs between the four periods revealed that after wounding stress, the greatest number of significant DEGs were enriched during the first 3 days, while fewer DEGs were enriched after day 3, which corresponding to only about 1/10 (353/3883) the number of DEGs during the first 3 days. In addition, putative unigenes involved in lignin biosynthesis, such as CSE, HCT, CCR, F5H, and CAD, were significantly down-regulation after D. cochinchinensis wounding stress, but the putative unigenes responsible for flavonoid biosynthesis, such as CHS, CHI, DFR, F3'5'H, F3H, ANR, FLS, and ANS were significantly up-regulation.", "We performed de novo transcriptome analysis of D.cochinchinensis under wounding stress, candidate genes and TFs involved in the biosynthesis and accumulation of flavonoids were identified, which is the first report on the transcript variants in flavonoid form accumulation in D. cochinchinensis under wounding stress. According to the results of DEGs analysis, wounding stress attenuated lignin biosynthesis meanwhile promoted flavonoid biosynthesis. In addition, we also compared the transcriptomics of the two different original plants (D.cochinchinensis and D.cambodiana) that form dragon's blood in order to provide further understanding of the formation of dragon's blood."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
