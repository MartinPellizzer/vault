The dispersive micro-solid phase extraction (D-\u03bc-SPE) of RA from the medical extract samples was investigated by using the prepared biocompatible composite as a solid phase. The HPLC-UV method was used for measuring the extracted RA. The important variables (pH, biocompatible composite mass, contact time, and volume of eluent) associated with the extraction process were analyzed by the application of central composite design (CCD). The achieved optimum values for the mentioned variables were 7.0, 10\u00a0mg, 4\u00a0min, and 180\u00a0\u03bcL, respectively. The extraction recovery (99.68%) obtained from the predicted model was in agreement with the experimental data (98.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.33%). In addition, under the obtained optimum conditions and over the concentration in the range of 2-3500\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>, a linear calibration curve was obtained with R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0>\u00a00.993. The limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) values were computed, and the obtained ranges were respectively from 0.060 to 0.089\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> and 0.201 to 0.297\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>. In addition, the enrichment factors were obtained in the range of 93.7-110.5 with preconcentration factor of 83.3. Therefore, the D-\u03bc-SPE-HPLC-UV method could be used for analyzing RA in the samples of the extracts obtained from the medical plants and water with the recovery values of the analyte in the range of 96.6%-105.4% and the precision with relative standard deviation <5.7%."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
