The growth rate, meristematic mitotic index, and growth rate recovery of the roots were determined. At 140 V/m there was no perturbation in growth rate or mitotic index. At 430 V/m the growth rate and the mitotic index were reduced. The mitotic index had a maximum depression (approximately 55% of control), which occurred at 4 h. The depression in growth rate was immediate and constant over time. When roots were exposed to an electric field at 430 V/m for 2 days, the growth rate was depressed by about 40%. When the field was terminated, the growth rate steadily increased and was almost normal after 5 days. At 490 V/m root growth rate was almost completely arrested. According to these results, there is a narrow range of induced membrane potentials that span the range from slightly altered to almost completely arrested growth rates."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Robertson", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "M W", "Initials": "MW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cox", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Davis", "ForeName": "H T", "Initials": "HT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Bioelectromagnetics", "NlmUniqueID": "8008281", "ISSNLinking": "0197-8462"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Electromagnetic Fields"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Electromagnetic Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitotic Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7326055", "10.1002/bem.2250020405"]}}]}
