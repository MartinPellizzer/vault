Living in such a unique manner is always mediated <i>via</i> a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances, which are composed mainly of polysaccharides or specifically exopolysaccharides (EPS). Biofilm formation and hence EPS production are affected by biotic and abiotic factors inducing/inhibiting several involved genes and other molecules. In addition, various aspects of bacterial EPS regarding: physiological functions, molecular weight, and chemical composition were demonstrated. Recent investigations have revealed a wide spectrum of EPS chemical and physicochemical properties showing promising applications in different industrial sectors. For instance, lactic acid bacteria (LAB)- and marine-derived EPS exhibit: immunomodulatory, antioxidant, antitumor, bioremediation of heavy metals, as well as thickening and viscosity modifiers in the food industry. However, bacterial EPS have not yet been commercially implemented, in contrast to plant-derived analogues. The current review aims to rediscover the EPS structural and biosynthetic features derived from marine and terrestrial bacteria, and applications as well."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5747-6972"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy Department, College of Pharmacy, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Bioprocess Engineering, Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany."}], "LastName": "Zayed", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3439-199X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Plants and Natural Products, National Organization for Drug Control and Research, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mansour", "ForeName": "Mai K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5612-8546"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy Department, College of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Sedeek", "ForeName": "Mohamed S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3732-5963"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Habib", "ForeName": "Mohamed H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Bioprocess Engineering, Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany."}], "LastName": "Ulber", "ForeName": "Roland", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5139-1863"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy Department, College of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, School of Sciences and Engineering, The American University in Cairo, New Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Farag", "ForeName": "Mohamed A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8505177", "ISSNLinking": "0738-8551"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides, Bacterial"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides, Bacterial"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "31"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34320886", "10.1080/07388551.2021.1942779"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
