The present study was designed to explore the protective mechanism of quercetin against lead-induced hepatic injury. We found that quercetin markedly decreased the MDA and H(2)O(2) levels and lowered the GSH/GSSG ratio in the liver of lead-treated rat. Moreover, quercetin markedly restored Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, CAT and GPx activities and upregulated mRNA expression levels of these proteins in the liver of lead-treated rat. Western blot analysis showed that quercetin significantly inhibited apoptosis by modulating the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 expression and suppressing the expression of phosphorylated JNK1/2 and cleaved caspase-3 in the liver of lead-treated rat. In conclusion, these data suggest that quercetin protects the rat liver from lead-induced injury by attenuating lipid peroxidation, renewing the activities of antioxidant enzymes and inhibiting apoptosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Crown Copyright \u00a9 2010.
