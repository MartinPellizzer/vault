DC.

CORT-induced nerve cells cytotoxicity was used to investigate the neuroprotection effect of LBRDDS and the underlying pharmacological mechanisms were explored by multiple experimental methods such as molecular docking, immunofluorescence, gain- or loss-of function experiments.", "Bioactive compounds in LBRDDS absorbed from intestinal tract were transformed or metabolized by the gut microbiota including palmitic acid, adrenic acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid and docosapentaenoic acid. Network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking of showed fatty acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis and neuroinflammation may be potential therapeutic targets of LBRDDS. LBRDDS can improve the activity of model cells, reduce cytotoxicity of lactate dehydrogenase, recover neurotransmitter imbalance, relieve inflammatory damage, down-regulate the expression of miRNA-144-3p, increase the mRNAs and protein expression level of Gad-67 and VGAT, and promote the synthesis and transport of GABA.", "Therefore, LBRDDS exerts neuroprotective effects by correcting neurotransmitter deficits and inflammation imbalance in the CORT-induced nerve cell injury model."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier GmbH.
