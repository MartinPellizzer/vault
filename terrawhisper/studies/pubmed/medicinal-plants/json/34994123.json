One hundred and thirty-three medicinal material samples, including the hole herb, root, stem/branch, leaf, flower, fruit, seed, and resin, were collected from the Orussey Herbal Market in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and then authenticated by ITS and psbA-trnH. A total of 46 samples were identified based on ITS sequences, belonging to 24 families, 40 genera, and 42 species. A total of 100 samples were identified by psbA-trnH sequences to belong to 42 families, 77 genera, and 84 species. A total of 103 samples were identified by two DNA barcodes. According to the morphological characteristics of the medicinal materials, 120 samples classified into 50 species, 86 genera, and 86 families were identified, and the majority of them were from Zingiberaceae, Fabaceae, and Acanthaceae. Such samples have been commonly used in traditional Cambodian medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, Unani medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, and ethnomedicine, but different medical systems focus on different functional aspects of the same medicinal material. The results of this study have demonstrated that DNA barcoding has a significant advantage in identifying herbal products, and this study has provided basic data for understanding the traditional medicinal materials used in Cambodia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Xue-Ping", "Initials": "XP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Yu-Qing", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Qiang", "ForeName": "Ting-Yan", "Initials": "TY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wen-Jie", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Resource Utilization, Northeast Forestry University Harbin 150040, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Yi-Chen", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ben-Gang", "Initials": "BG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhao", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Centre for Traditional Medicine Phnom Penh PHSAR THMEI 1, Cambodia."}], "LastName": "Huot", "ForeName": "Theang", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hai-Tao", "Initials": "HT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education,Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Yao-Dong", "Initials": "YD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cambodia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "59"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34994123", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20211014.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
