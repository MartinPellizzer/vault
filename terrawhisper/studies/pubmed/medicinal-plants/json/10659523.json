A whole new industry know as \"neutraceuticals\" has evolved. This new industry is a combination of the vitamin supplement and herbal industries trying to work with regulatory agents to develop good manufacturing processes to ensure that consumers obtain good products. In fact, some diabetics may be taking herbal or nutritional supplements without their physician's knowledge. Therefore, it is important to query diabetic patients at least once a year as to whether they are using any herbal or nutritional products. Once it is determined that a patient is using these products, physicians must decide if they or someone else should address the issue of taking these products. Physicians who have a good comfort level with herbal products by all means should recommend them to their patients. If such a comfort level is lacking or low, patients can be referred for a consultation on the use of supplements or told that information will be forwarded to them after contact is made with someone who has knowledge of diabetes and use of appropriate supplements. This article reviews nine nutrient and herbal remedies commonly used for diabetes to facilitate such patient education."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Millard Fillmore Hospital, Buffalo, NY, USA. endobob@pol.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mozersky", "ForeName": "R P", "Initials": "RP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Osteopath Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503065", "ISSNLinking": "0098-6151"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depression"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Neuropathies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10659523"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
