Firstly, the potential inhibitory effect of the designed compound against EGFR has been proven by docking experiments that showed correct binding modes and excellent binding energies of -98.44 and -88.00\u2009kcal/mol, against EGFR wild-type and mutant type, respectively. Furthermore, MD simulations studies confirmed the precise energetic, conformational, and dynamic alterations that occurred after binding to EGFR. The correct binding was also confirmed by essential dynamics studies. To further investigate the general drug-like properties of the developed candidate, <i>in silico</i> ADME and toxicity studies have also been carried out. The thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivative was synthesized following the earlier promising findings. Fascinatingly, the synthesized compound (<b>4</b>) showed promising inhibitory effects against EGFR<sup>WT</sup> and EGFR<sup>T790M</sup> with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 25.8 and 182.3\u2009nM, respectively. Also, it exhibited anticancer potentialities against A549 and MCF-7cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 13.06 and 20.13\u2009\u00b5M, respectively. Interestingly, these strong activities were combined with selectivity indices of 2.8 and 1.8 against the two cancer cell lines, respectively. Further investigations indicated the ability of compound <b>4</b> to arrest the cancer cells' growth at the G2/M phase and to increase early and late apoptosis percentages from 2.52% and 2.80 to 17.99% and 16.72%, respectively. Additionally, it was observed that compound <b>4</b> markedly increased the levels of caspase-3 and caspase-9 by 4 and 3-fold compared to the control cells. Moreover, it up-regulated the level of BAX by 3-fold and down-regulated the level of Bcl-2 by 3-fold affording a BAX/Bcl-2 ratio of 9.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
