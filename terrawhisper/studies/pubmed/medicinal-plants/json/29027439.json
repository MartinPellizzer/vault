Kirilowii, promoting the sustainable utilization of Rh. kirilowii resources. In this paper, we investigated the wild resources of Rh. kirilowii in 16 counties of Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu and Yunnan by means of investigation and sampling investigation combined with interview. The results showed that the population densities of wild Rh. kirilowii in 4 provinces were very different and the reserve of wild resources decreased gradually in many areas. According to the survey results, the current total reserve of Rh. kirilowii in four provinces was about 1 100 t. The reserve of wild Rh. kirilowii in Sichuan province was the largest. Simultaneously, the Rh. kirilowii had a certain ecological value. We found that a sand control base with planting Rh. kirilowii was set up in Hongyuan County of Sichuan Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture. The investigation provides a scientific basis for the development and sustainable utilization of Rh. kirilowii resources."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Dao-Xin", "Initials": "DX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Jin-Song", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Tibetan Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Rhodiola"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29027439", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170217.006"]}}]}
