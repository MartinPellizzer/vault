The suspension of intact Rhizobium lupini bacteroids in phosphate buffer solution pH 7.8 was shown to catalyse the biosynthesis from sucrose and ammonium of some amino acids, such as alanine, aspartic and glutamic acids, glycine and serine. The yield of alanine and aspartic acid was 2.5-3 times higher than that of other amino acids, which were formed in almost equal quantities. Intact bacteroids were also found to catalyse the biosynthesis of aspartic and glutamic acids, alanine and glycine from ammonium and Krebs cycle metabolites such as fumaric acid (FA), oxaloacetic acid (OAA), pyruvic acid (PA), alpha-ketoglutaric acid (alpha-KGA), malic acid (MA), as well as from glyoxylic acid (GOA). The biosynthesis of aspartic acid from fumaric acid was dominant. Besides that, the suspension of intact bacteroids catalysed transamination of aspartic and glutamic acids, the transamination of aspartic acid being especially intense with alpha-KGA and GOA. Aspartic acid was synthesized most efficiently through the amination of fumaric acid, while glutamic acid was better synthesized through the transamination of aspartic acid with alpha-KGA than through reductive amination of alpha-KGA. The experimental data proved that intact bacteroids possess Krebs cycle enzymes and primary ammonia assimilation enzymes. This enzyme complex permits bacteroids to detoxify ammonia, which they produce using sucrose and metabolites of Krebs cycle as the sources of carbon. The data obtained are of great interest as they prove the importance of bacteroids in the synthesis of amino acids from ammonium which is formed in the course of N2-fixation, and sucrose available from leaves."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kretovich", "ForeName": "W L", "Initials": "WL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kariakina", "ForeName": "T I", "Initials": "TI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kazakova", "ForeName": "O V", "Initials": "OV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sidelnikova", "ForeName": "L I", "Initials": "LI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kaloshina", "ForeName": "G S", "Initials": "GS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shaposhnikov", "ForeName": "G L", "Initials": "GL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mol Cell Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0364456", "ISSNLinking": "0300-8177"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-50-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Sucrose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Citric Acid Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sucrose"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1979 Jun;63(6):1082-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16660861"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1961 Nov;36(6):820-4", "ArticleIdList": ["16655596"]}, {"Citation": "Can J Microbiol. 1973 Dec;19(12):1493-9", "ArticleIdList": ["4149948"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1978 May;61(5):787-90", "ArticleIdList": ["16660386"]}, {"Citation": "Biokhimiia. 1980 Dec;45(12):2139-45", "ArticleIdList": ["7248347"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6855750", "10.1007/BF00215586"]}}]}
