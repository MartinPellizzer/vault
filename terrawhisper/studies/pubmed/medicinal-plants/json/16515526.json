Areas covered include recent advances in the development of drugs derived from marine organisms, microbes, terrestrial animals, and vascular plants, and current issues regarding botanical medicines. The role of natural products in drug discovery and development is evaluated, particularly with regard to their value as sources of drug leads with \"drug-like\" properties. A rationale for the success of natural products research in providing new drugs and drug prototypes is presented, drawing on lines of evidence from chemical informatics and chemical ecology. Several innovative strategies for natural products drug discovery and evaluation of botanical medicines are also reviewed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60612, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "William P", "Initials": "WP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chin", "ForeName": "Young-Won", "Initials": "YW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kinghorn", "ForeName": "A Douglas", "Initials": "AD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "100960531", "ISSNLinking": "1389-4501"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacognosy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}], "NumberOfReferences": "131"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16515526", "10.2174/138945006776054915"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
