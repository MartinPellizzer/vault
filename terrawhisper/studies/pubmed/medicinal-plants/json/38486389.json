(Mangosteen, queen of fruits), treats wounds, skin infections, and many other disorders. In fact, \u03b1-Mangostin and other xanthonoid, including \u03b2-Mangostin and \u03b3-Mangostin, are found in G. mangostana, which have various advantages, namely neuroprotective, anti-proliferative, antinociceptive, antioxidant, pro-apoptotic, anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, and hypoglycemic through multiple signaling mechanisms, for instance, extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK 1/2), mitogenactivated Protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB), transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This review presents comprehensive information on Mangosteen's pharmacological and antitoxic aspects and its xanthones against various natural and chemical toxins. Because of the insufficient clinical study, we hope the current research can benefit from performing clinical and preclinical studies against different toxic agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacodynamics and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yahyazadeh", "ForeName": "Roghayeh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rahimi", "ForeName": "Vafa Baradaran", "Initials": "VB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Karabuk University, Karabuk, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Yahyazadeh", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International UNESCO Center for Health-Related Basic Sciences and Human Nutrition, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Askari", "ForeName": "Vahid Reza", "Initials": "VR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Neuropharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "101157239", "ISSNLinking": "1570-159X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38486389", "10.2174/1570159X22666240212142655", "CN-EPUB-138439"]}}]}
