In the course of the study, we report that cinchona seedlings were brought to Japan for the first time in 1876, as per Takeaki Enomoto's proposal to the Meiji government. We also examine the details of his proposal in effort to clarify that the written proposal was submitted between February and March, 1874, and considered his motives leading to the submission. Cinchona is a very important medicinal plant that has saved human lives. However, there was no proof that Takeaki Enomoto's proposal made it introduction to Japan possible, nor was there any evidence that its cultivation was attempted. In addition, it was not clear that the details of the above has been found in document including the Nomutenmatsu (agricultural report published by the Meiji Government). It is significant that the details has been clarified by our series of studies not only from the standpoint of the history of pharmacy, but also from the accounts of the great predecessors involved, such as Takeaki Emonoto and Yasusade Tashiro."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hoshi University, 2-4-41 Ebara, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo 142-8501."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nagumo", "ForeName": "Seiji", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Izawa", "ForeName": "Kazuo", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Biography", "English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakushigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "1267223", "ISSNLinking": "0285-2314"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cinchona"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Famous Persons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indonesia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "International Cooperation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Netherlands"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "PersonalNameSubjectList": [{"LastName": "Enomoto", "ForeName": "Takeaki", "Initials": "T"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21661238"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
