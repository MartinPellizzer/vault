The structure of these crystals was examined by electron crystallography, using three different media to preserve high-resolution detail: vitrified water, glucose and tannin. The crystals diffracted electrons to at least 3.2 A resolution in all three media. R-factors between the three data sets of electron diffraction amplitudes ranged from 6.4% to 14.3%. Fourier difference maps were generated and compared to a projection map of the complex at 3.4 A resolution. No significant differences were found, proving that all three media preserved the native structure of LHC-II at high resolution. The probability of recording high-quality electron diffraction patterns with tannin was 90%. With glucose and water this probability was lower by a factor of 10 to 20, suggesting that tannin may be preferable as a preserving medium for sensitive biological specimens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Germany."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "D N", "Initials": "DN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "K\u00fchlbrandt", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "2985088R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2836"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Detergents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5712ZB110R", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorophyll b"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YF5Q9EJC8Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Detergents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fourier Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2005619", "10.1016/0022-2836(91)90526-c", "0022-2836(91)90526-C"]}}]}
