In the present study, the switch of the gametophytic developmental program toward a sporophytic pathway, \"embryogenesis,\" has been studied in three different plant species, Brassica, tobacco, and pepper. The switch has been induced by stress (heat shock) at the very responsive stage of the microspore, which is the vacuolate period. As a result, the cell nucleus undergoes striking structural changes with regard to late gametophytic development, including alterations of biosynthetic activities and proliferative activity. An enrichment in HSP70 heat-shock protein and in the presence of Ntf6-MAP kinase was observed after inductive treatment in the nuclei during early embryogenesis. This apparently reflected the possible roles of these proteins, specifically the protective role of HSP70 for the nuclear machinery, and signal transduction of Ntf6-MAPK for the entry of cells into proliferation. Importantly, the observed nuclear changes were similar in the three species investigated and represented convenient markers for early monitoring of embryogenesis and selection purposes for obtaining double-haploid plants in plant breeding."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2000 Academic Press."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Nuclear Organization during Plant Development, Centro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas, CSIC, Vel\u00e1zquez 144, Madrid, 28006, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Testillano", "ForeName": "P S", "Initials": "PS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Coronado", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Segu\u00ed", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Domenech", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Melendi", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Raska", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Risue\u00f1o", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Struct Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9011206", "ISSNLinking": "1047-8477"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Brassica"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Biosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spores"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10806072", "10.1006/jsbi.2000.4249", "S1047847700942497"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
