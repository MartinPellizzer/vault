In recent years, with the demand of medicinal plant resources surging and the change of the environment and human intervention factors, the medicinal plant resources reserve had accelerated pace of change. It is the prerequisite and basis for the development and utilization of medical plants that how to quickly and accurately attain reserve of some medicinal plants resources, the selection of suitable and accurate estimating method is reliable basis and can guarantee medicinal plant reserve survey, and also is one of the key reserve investigation of success. This paper systematically summarized the estimation method of medicinal plants in recent 30 years, and discussed the basic principle, the estimation model of development and evolution, advantages and disadvantages and applicability, and it aimed to improve the accuracy about reserves survey of medicinal plant resources, and provide scientific and reliable support data to medicinal plants resources for sustainable development and utilization of resources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jing-xia", "Initials": "JX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Min-hui", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Jing-niu", "Initials": "JN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhen-hua", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chun-hong", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26323124"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
