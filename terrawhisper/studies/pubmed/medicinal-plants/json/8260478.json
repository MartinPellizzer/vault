Twenty-four Large White x Landrace pigs of about 30 kg body weight were made hypercholesterolaemic by feeding a semi-purified diet, high in saturated fat and supplemented with 10 g cholesterol/kg, for 14 d. After that, six pigs were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental groups. They received their respective diets, containing 0, 100, 200 or 300 g baked beans/kg, on a dry-matter basis, for a further 28 d. Fasting blood samples were taken and analysed for total plasma cholesterol, lipoproteins and triacylglycerols. After the pigs were slaughtered at the end of the study, livers were analysed for their cholesterol content. Consumption of baked beans at 100, 200 and 300 g/kg reduced plasma total cholesterol by 5.3, 20.2 and 35.6% respectively. However, only the diet with 300 g baked beans/kg showed a significant reduction (P < 0.05) compared with the control (without baked beans). The level of low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol was also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced by 48% at 300 g baked beans/kg. Plasma very-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol, high-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol and triacylglycerol contents were not affected by bean consumption. The supplements of 200 and 300 g baked beans/kg promoted a significant (P < 0.05) reduction of about 50% in cholesterol deposition in the liver, compared with the control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, University of Reading, Berks."}], "LastName": "Costa", "ForeName": "N M", "Initials": "NM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Walker", "ForeName": "A F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Low", "ForeName": "A G", "Initials": "AG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0372547", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hypercholesterolemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8260478", "10.1079/bjn19930145", "S0007114593001473"]}}]}
