Various parts of Dillenia pentagyna are used in traditional medicine in India for treatment of various disorders including cancers, but detailed mechanisms are still unknown. Dried leaves of D. pentagyna were extracted with ethanol and termed as an ethanolic extract of leaves of D. pentagyna (EELDP). Our aim was to elucidate the role of EELDP in in-vitro cell migration and apoptosis in highly metastatic human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. We measured cell viability and in-vitro cell migration in three different human cancer cells A549, HeLa and U2OS treated with EELDP (0-0.6\u2009mg/mL). However, A549 cells showed higher sensitivity to EELDP treatment. Hence we studied several key markers of metastasis and apoptosis pathway in A549 cells treated with EELDP. EELDP treatment significantly reduced in-vitro cell migration, wound healing, expression and activity of MMP-2, MMP-9 via reduction of nuclear factor kappa Beta (NF-\u03ba\u03b2). EELDP also reduced vimentin, N-cadherin and increased claudin-1. The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis was triggered by EELDP via the NF-\u03ba\u03b2 pathway through the increase of the Bax to Bcl<sub>2</sub> ratio, leading to the fall of mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequently induced release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3 followed by nuclear fragmentation in A549 cells. Furthermore, we observed change of a few markers of metastasis and apoptosis in other two cell types HeLa and U2OS treated with EELDP. These data implicate that the effect of EELDP is not cell-specific. Since only 0.1\u2009mg/mL EELDP significantly reduces in-vitro cell migration and increases apoptosis, the active compound(s) present in EELDP is very much potent to control highly metastatic cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Kalyani, Kalyani, India."}], "LastName": "De", "ForeName": "Debapriya", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Kalyani, Kalyani, India."}], "LastName": "Chowdhury", "ForeName": "Priyanka", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, North Orissa University, Baripada, Odisha, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Panda", "ForeName": "Sujogya K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2723-796X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Kalyani, Kalyani, India."}], "LastName": "Ghosh", "ForeName": "Utpal", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Retracted Publication"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "8205768", "ISSNLinking": "0730-2312"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "3-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-2-propenenitrile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitriles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.24", "NameOfSubstance": "MMP2 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.35", "NameOfSubstance": "MMP9 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.35", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Cell Biochem. 2021 Dec;122(12):1972. doi: 10.1002/jcb.30167", "PMID": "34704623"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "A549 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Movement"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dilleniaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Down-Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitriles"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfones"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31318086", "10.1002/jcb.29289"]}}]}
