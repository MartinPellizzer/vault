The northeast Brazil crop system based on this cotton type is finished, with a few small area planted in the three main States, where it was previously cultivated (Cear\u00e1, Para\u00edba, and Rio Grande do Norte), but in others, maintenance is accomplished by single dooryard plants. Plants were found in all visited Northeast Brazil municipalities, sometimes in the North of the country, and were collected for ex situ preservation and evaluation. Most of seeds had no fuzz (62.2%) and 94.6% of the genotypes presented spot in flowers. Seventy-one alleles were revealed in 12 loci. The genetic structure of the population evaluated by microsatellite markers shows two main groups, one comprising the Serid\u00f3 region where landraces were originated and other comprising the state of Cear\u00e1, where a specific breeding program was developed. Genotypes collected in North Brazil States as well as those collected in Bahia, Alagoas, and Sergipe grouped with those collected in Cear\u00e1. The Mantel correlogram indicates a significant (P < 0.05) correlation between genetic and geographical distances up to 77 km. The ex situ maintenance and agronomical evaluation are the main concerns for moc\u00f3, as the use of the agricultural interesting traits, possibly introgressed to other genotypes, is predicted. The in situ preservation is still of interest since there is more diversity there than in the collected plants and some should be continued due to use as medicinal plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Biologia, Instituto Federal Goiano, Uruta\u00ed, GO, Brasil."}], "LastName": "de Menezes", "ForeName": "I P P", "Initials": "IPP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Embrapa Algod\u00e3o, Santo Ant\u00f4nio de Goi\u00e1s, GO, Brasil lucia.hoffmann@embrapa.br."}], "LastName": "Hoffmann", "ForeName": "L V", "Initials": "LV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Biologia, Instituto Federal Goiano, Uruta\u00ed, GO, Brasil."}], "LastName": "de Lima", "ForeName": "T H", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Biologia, Instituto Federal Goiano, Uruta\u00ed, GO, Brasil."}], "LastName": "da Silva", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": ", , Brasil."}], "LastName": "Lucena", "ForeName": "V S", "Initials": "VS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Embrapa Monitoramento por Sat\u00e9lite."}], "LastName": "Barroso", "ForeName": "P A V", "Initials": "PAV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Genet Mol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101169387", "ISSNLinking": "1676-5680"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evolution, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Pool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Gossypium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantitative Trait, Heritable"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Selective Breeding"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28973721", "10.4238/gmr16039659", "gmr-16-03-gmr.16039659"]}}]}
