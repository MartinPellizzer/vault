One adult from each household was interviewed. The ethnobotonical survey was carried out during the period February 2007 to March 2007. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS, version 9.0.

Level of significance also determined by using 95% of confidence intervals and p-value.", "Overall, 97.2% of the respondents had ample knowledge and usage custom concerning traditional insect/mosquito repellent plants. Application of smoke (91.55%) was one of the most commonly well-known methods amongst local community by burning the plant parts such as leaves, stems and roots. Leaves were used by 90.2% for the application smoke. Knowledge and usage custom of traditional insect/mosquito repellent plants had significantly associated with sex (p=0.013) and lower income of respondents (p=0.002). In spite of this, knowledge and usage custom had no significant association with age and educational status. Furthermore, the survey also indicated that most commonly known traditional insect/mosquito repellent plants were Woira*(1) (Olea europaea) 44%, Tinjut* (Ostostegia integrifolia) 39%, Neem* (Azadirachta indica) 14.1%, Wogert* (Silene macroserene) 1.4%, and Kebercho* (Echinops sp.) 1.1%.", "Indigenous traditional insect/mosquito repellent plants have been used by local hamlet since ancient times for various medicinal purposes.
