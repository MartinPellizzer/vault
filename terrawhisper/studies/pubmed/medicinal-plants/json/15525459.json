The serum drug concentration was determined by specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by Drug and Statistics version 1.0 program.", "The calibration curve for MLB was linear over a range of 16-4096 microg/L with coefficients of correlation >0.999. The intra- and inter-day precisions (CV) of analysis were <10 %, and accuracy ranged from 90 % to 113 %. After i.v. administration of MLB at the doses of 3, 6, and 12 mg/kg, the C(0) values for MLB were estimated to be of 24, 47, and 107 mg/L, respectively. The AUC increased with the increasing doses for iv administration, and the mean AUC(0-t) values were 109.3, 247.9, and 582.4 mg x min x L(-1), respectively. MLB was distributed and eliminated quickly from central compartment, the mean T(1/2alpha) values for MLB at doses of 3, 6, 12 mg/kg were 2.2, 2.7, and 2.9 min, and the mean T(1/2beta) values were 43, 42, and 42 min, respectively.", "This LC-MS/MS method is rapid, sensitive, and specific for the pharmacokinetic study of MLB. The kinetic process of MLB in beagle dogs in vivo was best fitted to a two-compartment model. For i.v. administration, the pharmacokinetic parameters of C(0) and AUC have good linearity among the doses, and MLB was distributed and eliminated quickly in beagle dogs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao-chuan", "Initials": "XC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Wei-kang", "Initials": "WK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Gang-yi", "Initials": "GY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Jing-ying", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yi-ping", "Initials": "YP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "122021-74-3", "NameOfSubstance": "lithospermate B"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Area Under Curve"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15525459"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
