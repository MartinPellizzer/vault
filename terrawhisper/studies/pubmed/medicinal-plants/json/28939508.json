In our previous study, water extractable polysaccharide (ZLPs-W) and alkali extractable polysaccharide (ZLPs-A) was sequentially prepared from the swollen culms of Zizania latifolia. In vitro cell assay revealed that ZLPs-W without cytotoxicity had higher immunomodulatory activity than ZLPs-A. Therefore, in this study, ZLPs-W was further separated to three purified polysaccharides of ZLPs-W1, ZLPs-W2, and ZLPs-W3 by anion exchange chromatography and size exclusive chromatography in sequence. They were found to be homogeneous polysaccharides in \u03b2-type glycosidic linkage. ZLPs-W1 and ZLPs-W2 without triple helix conformation mainly contained Glc in molar percentage of 96.47% and 85.1%, respectively. ZLPs-W3 with triple helix conformation mainly consisted of Man, Rha, GalA, Glc, Gal and Ara in the molar ratio of 10.23:14.14:37.44:17.14:16.54:4.51. In addition, all the three purified polysaccharides could effectively enhanced the proliferation, phagocytosis, and nitric oxide production of murine macrophage RAW 264.7, suggesting that they possessed a potent immunostimulatory activity and could be developed as immunomodulator in medicine or functional food areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
