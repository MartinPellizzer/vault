It has become a global health problem, with hundreds of millions of people being affected. Both its incidence and prevalence are increasing over time. More than $20,000 are spent on each patient per year. The economic burden on the patients, as well as the society, is heavy and their life quality worsen over time. However, there are still limited effective therapeutic strategies for CKD. Patients mainly rely on dialysis and renal transplantation, which cannot prevent all the complications of CKD. Great efforts are needed in understanding the nature of CKD progression as well as developing effective therapeutic methods, including pharmacological agents. This paper reviews three aspects in the research of CKD that may show great interests to those who devote to bioanalysis, biomedicine and drug development, including important endogenous biomarkers quantification, mechanisms underlying CKD progression and current status of CKD therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Ruikang Hospital Affiliated to Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, 530011, Nanning, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory of Southwest Endangered Medicinal Resources Development, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, No. 189, Changgang Road, 530023, Nanning, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Xiaosheng", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Ruikang Hospital Affiliated to Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, 530011, Nanning, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Ruikang Hospital Affiliated to Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, 530011, Nanning, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Xiangdong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Ruikang Hospital Affiliated to Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, 530011, Nanning, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Botao", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory of Southwest Endangered Medicinal Resources Development, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, No. 189, Changgang Road, 530023, Nanning, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Fangfang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, 530001, Nanning, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Lanlan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, 369, Fulham Road, London SW10 9NH, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Dev", "ForeName": "Sooranna", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Ruikang Hospital Affiliated to Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, 530011, Nanning, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Taisheng", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Progression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Renal Dialysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "physiopathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31742493", "10.2174/1381612825666191119094354", "CPD-EPUB-102446"]}}]}
