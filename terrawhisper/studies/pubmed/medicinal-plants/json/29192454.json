In order to evaluate the quality of Paris rapidly and ensure the efficacy in clinical therapy, we quantified the contents of polyphyllin \u2160, polyphyllin \u2161 and polyphyllin \u2166 using infrared spectroscopy with partial least squares regression(PLSR). The method for evaluating the quality of Paris was established. Infrared spectra of 78 samples from various species in different origins were collected. The contents of polyphyllin \u2160, \u2161 and \u2166 were determined by high performance liquid chromatography(HPLC). The HPLC data were combined with the spectral data to predict the contents of three polyphyllin rapidly. Multiplicative signal correction(MSC), standard normal variate(SNV), orthogonal signal correction(OSC), first derivative and second derivative were utilized for the spectral preprocessing. Then, the optimized spectral data were used to establish the quantitative prediction model based on PLSR. The results showed that the best spectral pretreatment of polyphyllin \u2160 and \u2161 were MSC+OSC+2nd Der and that of polyphyllin \u2166 was MSC+SNV+OSC+2nd Der. In the quantitative calibration model, the determination coefficients (R\u00b2) of polyphyllin \u2160, polyphyllin \u2161 and polyphyllin \u2166 were 0.930 8, 0.934 8 and 0.912 3, respectively while the Root mean square error of estimation(RMSEE) were 1.855 0, 0.632 3 and 0.001 6 mg\u2022g\u207b\u00b9, respectively. In the verification model, the R\u00b2 of polyphyllin \u2160, polyphyllin \u2161 and polyphyllin \u2166 were 0.948 8, 0.703 6 and 0.801 7, respectively, and the root mean square error of prediction(RMSEP)were 1.704 6, 1.227 8 and 0.002 0 mg\u2022g\u207b\u00b9, respectively. Because of the predictive value of quantitative model was closed to the real value, the effect of the model was good. The model of polyphyllin \u2160 and \u2161 were better than that of polyphyllin \u2166. The developed method was non-destructive, fast, and accurate. It was feasible to determine the content of polyphyllin in Paris."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming 650500, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming 650200, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Zhe", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming 650200, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming 650200, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jin-Yu", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Fu-Rong", "Initials": "FR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming 650200, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuan-Zhong", "Initials": "YZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Steroids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "polyphyllin I"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "polyphyllin II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "polyphyllin VII"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K49P2K8WLX", "NameOfSubstance": "Diosgenin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Diosgenin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Least-Squares Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Melanthiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Steroids"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29192454", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170728.009"]}}]}
