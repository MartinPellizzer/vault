The structures of atramacronoids D-R were elucidated based on extensive spectroscopic data analysis, Snatzke's rule, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and X-ray crystallographic analysis. Notably, of the undescribed isolates, atramacronoids D and E are the first example of eudesmanolactam-phenol and eudesmanolactam-ethyl hybrids obtained from plants, respectively. A pair of enantiomers, (+)- and (-)-atramacronoids F, were successfully resolved by chiral-phase HPLC. Atramacronoid D exhibited weak cytotoxicity against SGC-7901\u00a0cells. Atramacronoid E significantly promoted the proliferation of LPS-induced IEC-6\u00a0cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
