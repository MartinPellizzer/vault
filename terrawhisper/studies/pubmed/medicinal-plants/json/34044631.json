Salicylic acid reduces fruit respiration and ethylene biosynthesis, during storage of fruits. Similarly, application of oxalic acid is a secure and hopeful postharvest handling technology for keeping quality and prolonging storage life of fruit. To study the effect of Salicylic acid and oxalic acid in enhancing the quality and extending the shelf life of grape, the present investigation was conducted. The grape berries were treated with Oxalic acid (OA) (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5\u2009mM) and Salicylic acid (SA) (0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2\u2009mM). The treatments were compared within 16th days at an interval of 4\u2009days. Among the treatments, SA (2\u2009mM) showed superiority in different quality attributing characters like physiological loss in weight (PLW), berry firmness, rachis browning, berry appearance, fungal decay, berry shattering, TSS, ascorbic acid, titratable acidity, total sugars, reducing sugars, TSS: acid ratio, taste, overall acceptability and shelf life. Hence, SA (2\u2009mM) can be used as an effective strategy for maintaining quality of table grapes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6452-8731"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticulture, Aromatic and Medicinal Plants, School of Earth Sciences and Natural Resources Management, Mizoram University, Aizawl, India."}], "LastName": "Hazarika", "ForeName": "T K", "Initials": "TK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticulture, Aromatic and Medicinal Plants, School of Earth Sciences and Natural Resources Management, Mizoram University, Aizawl, India."}], "LastName": "Marak", "ForeName": "Tangkasil", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Food Sci Technol Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9889534", "ISSNLinking": "1082-0132"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sugars"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9E7R5L6H31", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxalic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O414PZ4LPZ", "NameOfSubstance": "Salicylic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethylenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxalic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Salicylic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sugars"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vitis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "38"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34044631", "10.1177/10820132211020612"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
