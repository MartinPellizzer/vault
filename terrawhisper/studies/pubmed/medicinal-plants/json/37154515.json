Recent studies indicated that microglial injury could contribute to neuroinflammation and is associated with neuronal damage. Nevertheless, the neurotoxic mechanism underlying the arsenic-induced microglial injury requires additional research. This study explores whether cathepsin B promotes microglia cell damage caused by NaAsO<sub>2</sub>. Through CCK-8 assay and Annexin V-FITC and PI staining, we discovered that NaAsO<sub>2</sub> induced apoptosis in BV2 cells (a microglia cell line). NaAsO<sub>2</sub> was verified to increase mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP) and promote the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through JC-1 staining and DCFDA assay, respectively. Mechanically, NaAsO<sub>2</sub> was indicated to increase the expression of cathepsin B, which could stimulate pro-apoptotic molecule Bid into the activated form, tBid, and increase lysosomal membrane permeabilization by Immunofluorescence and Western blot assessment. Subsequently, apoptotic signaling downstream of increased mitochondrial membrane permeabilization was activated, promoting caspase activation and microglial apoptosis. Cathepsin B inhibitor CA074-Me could mitigate the damage of microglial. In general, we found that NaAsO<sub>2</sub> induced microglia apoptosis and depended on the role of the cathepsin B-mediated lysosomal-mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Our findings provided new insight into NaAsO<sub>2</sub>-induced neurological damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["74628"], "Affiliation": "College of Basic Medical, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zheyu", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["74628"], "Affiliation": "College of Basic Medical, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Pi", "ForeName": "Ruozheng", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["74628"], "Affiliation": "College of Basic Medical, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Yuheng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["74628"], "Affiliation": "College of Basic Medical, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": ["74628"], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Mashaal", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3418-5739"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["74628"], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Heng", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["74628"], "Affiliation": "College of Basic Medical, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Jieya", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["74628"], "Affiliation": "College of Basic Medical, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7003-6119"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["74628"], "Affiliation": "College of Basic Medical, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": ["74628"], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Monitoring and Disease Control, Ministry of Education, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Baofei", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hum Exp Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "9004560", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cathepsin B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N712M78A8G", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cathepsin B"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microglia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arsenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lysosomes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37154515", "10.1177/09603271231172724"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
