The 20-hydroxyecdysone content was determined using thin-layer chromatography after a simple clean up that had been performed by solid-phase extraction. Inorganic constitutents were determined using either ICP or flame photometry. Vegetation dependence of both 20-hydroxyecdysone and inorganic elements was studied. Serratula coronata shows remarkable high 20-hydroxyecdysone (2.3%, in April) and the studied Serratula plants gave a minimum of 20-hydroxyecdysone in June. Favorable period for harvesting is suggested as July and August, through the blossoming of these plants. Potassium and 20-hydroxyecdysone content gave a similar tendency considering their vegetation dependence, while the magnesium content moved toward opposite direction. The calcium contents of Serratula tinctoria, Serratula wolffii and Serratula coronata were found between 2.2% and 3.8%, which values are high relative to the other medicinal plants. At the same time, the Cu content of the ecdysteroid producing (and screened) Caryophyllaceae plants is low. The Fe, Mn and Mg contents of Serratula coronata are high, even higher than that of the Leuzea carthamoides. Our results have suggested the importance of analysis and control of inorganic constituents of crude plant extracts used for medicinal and recreational purposes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi Albert Orvostudom\u00e1nyi Egyetem Gy\u00f3gyn\u00f6v\u00e9ny \u00e9s Drogismereti Int\u00e9zet, Szeged."}], "LastName": "B\u00e1thori", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kal\u00e1sz", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Csikkeln\u00e9", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "M\u00e1th\u00e9", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Serratula fajok 20-hidroxiekdizon \u00e9s szervetlen elem tartalm\u00e1nak vizsg\u00e1lata."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Hungary", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharm Hung", "NlmUniqueID": "0414322", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6659"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ecdysteroids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Steroids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42Z2K6ZL8P", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5289-74-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ecdysterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I38ZP9992A", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecdysteroids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ecdysterone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Manganese"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Steroids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10389301"]}}]}
