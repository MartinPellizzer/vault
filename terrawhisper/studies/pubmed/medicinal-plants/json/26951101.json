Besides genetic influences, there are some acquired and environmental risk factors dominating thrombotic diseases. Although standard regimens have been used for a long time, many side effects still occur which can be life threatening. Therefore, natural products are good alternatives. Although the quest for antithrombotic natural products came to light only since the end of last century, in the last two decades, a considerable number of natural products showing antithrombotic activities (antiplatelet, anticoagulant and fibrinolytic) with no or minimal side effects have been reported. In this review, several natural products used as antithrombotic agents including medicinal plants, vegetables, fruits, spices and edible mushrooms which have been discovered in the last 15 years and their target sites (thrombogenic components, factors and thrombotic pathways) are described. In addition, the side effects, limitations and interactions of standard regimens with natural products are also discussed. The active compounds could serve as potential sources for future research on antithrombotic drug development. As a future direction, more advanced researches (in quest of the target cofactor or component involved in antithrombotic pathways) are warranted for the development of potential natural antithrombotic medications (alone or combined with standard regimens) to ensure maximum safety and efficacy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Human Genome Centre, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 16150 Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia. ayoncx70@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Islam", "ForeName": "Md Asiful", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alam", "ForeName": "Fahmida", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khalil", "ForeName": "Md Ibrahim", "Initials": "MI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sasongko", "ForeName": "Teguh Haryo", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "shgan@usm.my."}], "LastName": "Gan", "ForeName": "Siew Hua", "Initials": "SH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fibrinolytic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Fibrinolytic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26951101", "10.2174/1381612822666160307150454", "CPD-EPUB-74243"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
