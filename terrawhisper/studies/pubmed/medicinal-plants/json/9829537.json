N2a cells transfected with the connexin 43 gene showed restored cell-to-cell dye transfer, which could then be improved nearly fourfold by addition of apigenin. To test the drugs in HSV thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-tk/GCV) tumor killing, mixtures of 90% wild-type (WT) with 10% HSV-tk gene-modified MCA38 adenocarcinoma cells were exposed in vitro to GCV +/- apigenin or lovastatin. A significant bystander effect (BSE) was seen following GCV treatment alone, while neither apigenin or lovastatin alone had any effect on the recovery of viable tumor colonies. However, GCV-treated cultures also exposed to apigenin or lovastatin showed an increased BSE and reduced tumor cell recovery. Thirty percent of mice bearing tumors from the same mixture of 90% WT and 10% HSV-tk MCA38 cells treated with GCV alone became tumor free. Tumor-bearing mice given only two or three injections of lovastatin or apigenin during GCV treatment had a doubling of the antitumor response rate, with 60-70% of the mice achieving complete remission. These results support the hypothesis that the transfer of phosphorylated GCV from HSV-tk gene-expressing cells to neighboring WT tumor cells is a major component of the BSE and that pharmacological manipulation of GJ function with lovastatin or apigenin can result in striking improvement in the antitumor response in mice with tumors modified to contain as few as 10% HSV-tk cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Gene Therapy Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}], "LastName": "Touraine", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vahanian", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ramsey", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Blaese", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Hum Gene Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "9008950", "ISSNLinking": "1043-0342"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Connexin 43"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9LHU78OQFD", "NameOfSubstance": "Lovastatin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.21", "NameOfSubstance": "Thymidine Kinase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P9G3CKZ4P5", "NameOfSubstance": "Ganciclovir"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenocarcinoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chamomile"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Connexin 43"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ganciclovir"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gap Junctions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lovastatin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "genetics", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Simplexvirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Survival Rate"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Thymidine Kinase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9829537", "10.1089/hum.1998.9.16-2385"]}}]}
