After 25 days' treatment fin l body weight, and the weights of testes, epididymides, seminal vesicles, and adrenal glands were measured. Testis, epididymides, and seminal vesicles were prepared for histological examination and total protein, RNA, sialic acid, and alkaline phosphatase activity were determined. Quantitative estimation of cholesterol was also made. While overall body weight remained stable during treatment, testicular weight in both animals was drastically decreased. A complete spermatogenic arrest in the testes was evident in house rats treated with 50 mg/day for 20 days and in the gerbil treated with 25 mg/day for 25 days. The seminiferous tubules showed marked degeneration, lined by 1 or 2 cell layers. Epididymides showed degenerative changes as well. RNA contents of the testes, epididydmides, and seminal vesicles of treated anials were significantly lowered as was sialilc acid content. Total cholesterol was increased significantly. M. conzattii causes an effective inhibition of spermatogenesis in gerbils and house rats in 25 states and induces infertility."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["773159", "00040986"], "GeneralNote": [], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Animals, Laboratory", "Anthropometry", "Biology", "Body Weight", "Child Development", "Clinical Research", "Contraception", "Contraception Research", "Contraceptive Agents", "Contraceptive Agents, Male", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Enzymatic Effects", "Enzymes And Enzyme Inhibitors", "Epididymis", "Evaluation", "Family Planning", "Genitalia", "Genitalia, Male", "Growth", "Health", "Health Services", "Histology", "Ingredients And Chemicals", "Male Contraception", "Medicine", "Physiology", "Plants, Medicinal--administraction and dosage", "Plants, Medicinal--side effects", "Research Methodology", "Seminal Vesicles", "Spermatogenesis Blocking Agents", "Testis", "Urogenital System"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "598890", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1978", "Month": "03", "Day": "10"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0019-5189", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "15", "Issue": "7", "PubDate": {"Year": "1977", "Month": "Jul"}}, "Title": "Indian journal of experimental biology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Indian J Exp Biol"}, "ArticleTitle": "Effects of Malva viscus conzattii Greenm flower extract on testicular function of the house rat Rattus rattus Rufescens & the gerbil Meriones hurrianae Jerdon: a biochemical study.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "506", "EndPage": "509", "MedlinePgn": "506-9"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dixit", "ForeName": "V P", "Initials": "VP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gerbillinae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Testis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["598890"]}}]}
