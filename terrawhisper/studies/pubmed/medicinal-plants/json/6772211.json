Increase in electron transport rate and the decay rate of the 518 nm absorption change, induced by EDTA treatment, is prevented by cations. The order of effectiveness is C3+ > C2+ > C+. 2. In this respect methyl viologen is an effective divalent cation in addition to its action as an electron acceptor. 3. Complete cation irreversible EDTA-induced uncoupling occurs in the dark in 2 min. Light greatly stimulates the rate of uncoupling by EDTA. It is concluded that the uncoupling is due to release of coupling factor I from the thylakoid membrane. 4. Binding of purified coupling factor I to coupling factor I-depleted thylakoids can be achieved with any cation. The order of effectiveness is C3+ > C2+ > C+, reconstituted thylakoids are active in photophosphorylation regardless of the cation used for coupling factor I binding. 5. The marked difference in the concentration requirements for cation effects on 9-aminoacridine fluorescence yield and for prevention of uncoupling by EDTA indicate that coupling factor I and its binding site have a lower surface charge density than the net surface charge density of the thylakoid membrane. 6. It is concluded that coupling factor I binding only occurs when negative charges on coupling factor I and its binding site are electrostatically screened by cations. 7. Previously reported examples of uncoupling by low ionic conditions are discussed in relation to the basic concepts of diffuse electrical layer theory."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Telfer", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Barber", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jagendorf", "ForeName": "A T", "Initials": "AT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biochim Biophys Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0217513", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Uncoupling Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9G34HU7RV0", "NameOfSubstance": "Edetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cations"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Edetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photophosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stimulation, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Uncoupling Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "7", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6772211", "10.1016/0005-2728(80)90164-4", "0005-2728(80)90164-4"]}}]}
