Accordingly, certain aspects of EBV pathobiology have shown promise in anti-cancer research in developing virus-targeting methods for EBV-associated cancers. The unique role of EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) in triggering episome-dependent functions has made it as the only latent gene to be expressed in most EBV+\u00a0neoplasms. Dimeric EBNA1 binds to the replication origin (oriP) to display its biological impact on EBV-driven cell transformation and maintenance. Hence, EBNA1/oriP has been made an ideal drug target site for anti-EBV protocol development. GAP31 protein was originally isolated from the seeds of an ancient medicinal plant Gelonium multiflorum. Although GAP31 has been shown to exhibit both anti-viral and anti-tumor activity, current understanding of the mechanistic picture underlying GAP31 functioning is not clear. Herein, we identify the EBNA1 DNA-binding domain as a core for GAP31 binding by performing affinity pulldown assays. Recombinant GAP31 (rGAP31) was shown to impair EBNA1-induced dimerization; consequently, it abrogated both EBNA1/oriP-mediated binding and transcription. Importantly, the therapeutic effects of GAP31 showed its capability to abrogate EBV-driven cell transformation and proliferation, and EBV-dependent tumorigenesis in xenograft animal models. Notably, the EBNA1 binding-mutant rGAP31<sub>R166A/R169A</sub> simply exhibits defective phenotypes in the above-mentioned studies. Our data suggest rGAP31 is a potential anti-viral drug which can be applied to the development of therapeutic strategies against EBV-related malignancies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
