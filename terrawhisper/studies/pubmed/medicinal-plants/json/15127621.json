EIC 800 and 946 were selected as differentiation marks to distinguish P. notoginseng from the other two species. The EIC 800 and 946 of P. notoginseng were also compared to the EICs obtained by the same method from Chinese patent medicines of compound Danshen pellet, compound Danshen tablet, and compound Danshen injection.
