The main volatile chemical components were butyldienephthalide (20.65%) and ligustilide (50.15%) for RLC; and n-hexadecanoic acid (20.18%), [Z,Z]9,12-octadecadienoic acid (30.11%), 2-hydroxy-benzaldehyde (17.08%) for RPR, and butyldienephthalide (14.80%), and ligustilide (38.91%) for RLC-RPR. The main volatile chemical components of RLC-RPR were almost the same as those of RLC, but the relative amounts were altered.", "The number of volatile chemical components in RLC-RPR was almost equal to the sum of the number in the 2 constituent herbs, but the relative amounts were altered.
