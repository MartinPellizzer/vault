In order to promote the growth of single cells, it was essential to establish an appropriate ratio between 2,4-D concentration and KT concentration in the MS medium. The best combination of these two hormones was 1.5 mg/l and 0.5 mg/l, respectively. Considering the formation of cell clones, the suitable NH2NO4 concentration and CaCl2.2H2O concentration should be 400 mg/l and 750 mg/l, respectively. The plating efficiency can also be effectively increased when the plating medium was suitably supplemented with succinic acid, arginine, vitamins, etc. In optimization of the nutritional compositions of the medium, the plating efficiency was increased 2.34 times against the control. The cells suspended for 12 days were most favorable for the formation of cell clones. Different plating efficiency was obtained with different cell plating density. There was a low plating efficiency when the cell plating density was lower than 4 x 10(3) cells/ml."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy Sciences."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhen", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gan", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Chin J Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "9100855", "ISSNLinking": "1042-749X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Salts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clone Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8061238"]}}]}
