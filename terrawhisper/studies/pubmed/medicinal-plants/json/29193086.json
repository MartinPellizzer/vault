Raw herbal medicine samples were treated by ultrasonication-assisted extraction with 70% methanol and immunoaffinity column clean-up, and the decoctions were prepared following the commonly used boiling method with water for 2 h. Then, the optimized high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) method was validated for the quantitative analysis of four aflatoxins (AFG<sub>2</sub> , AFG<sub>1</sub> , AFB<sub>2</sub> and AFB<sub>1</sub> ) after postcolumn photochemical derivatization, which was proved to be reliable and sensitive.", "Aflatoxins were detected to be transferred from the herbal medicines to decoctions with significantly different transfer rates in the five types of herbal medicines. Quietly high transfer rates of 7.26-115.36% for AFG<sub>2</sub> , 4.37-26.37% for AFB<sub>1</sub> and 9.64-47.68% for AFB<sub>2</sub> were obtained.
