The rats were grouped and treated: (1) control (saline), (2) LPS (1\u2009mg/kg i.p.), and (3-5) 100, 200, or 400\u2009mg/kg NS hydro-alcoholic extract 30\u2009min before LPS injection. The treatment was started since 6\u2009days before the behavioral experiments and continued during the behavioral tests (LPS injection 2\u2009h before each behavioral experiment). Finally, the brains were removed for biochemical assessments. In Morris water maze (MWM) test, LPS increased the escape latency and traveled path compared to control group, whereas all doses of NS hydro-alcoholic extract decreased them compared to LPS group. In passive avoidance (PA) test, the latency to enter the dark compartment in LPS group was shorter than control group while in all treated groups it was longer than LPS group. LPS increased tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide (NO) metabolites, and decreased thiol content, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) in the hippocampal tissues compared to control group while NS hydro-alcoholic extract decreased MDA and NO metabolites and increased thiol content, SOD, and CAT compared to LPS group. Findings of the current study indicated that the hydro-alcoholic extract of NS improved the LPS-induced learning and memory impairments induced by LPS in rats by improving hippocampal cytokine levels and brain tissues oxidative damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Neurocognitive Sciences , Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Norouzi", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Neurocognitive Sciences , Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Abareshi", "ForeName": "Azam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Basic Science and Neuroscience Research Center , Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences , Torbat Heydariyeh , Iran."}], "LastName": "Beheshti", "ForeName": "Farimah", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Khazaei", "ForeName": "Majid", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Neurocognitive Sciences , Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Shafei", "ForeName": "Mohammad Naser", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Soukhtanloo", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Gholamnezhad", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "g Department of Physiology, School of Medicine , Jiroft University of Medical Sciences , Jiroft , Iran."}], "LastName": "Anaeigoudari", "ForeName": "Akbar", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "lipopolysaccharide, E coli O55-B5"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hippocampus"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maze Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "metabolism", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Memory Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nigella sativa"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29589766", "10.1080/01480545.2018.1447578"]}}]}
