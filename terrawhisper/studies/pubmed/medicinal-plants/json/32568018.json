Continuous exposure with available medication leads to the development of new strains with a significant amount of resistance, due to which pharmaceutical industries are facing various challenges. Antimicrobial resistance is the phenomenon causing a challenge in new drug development through conventional methods. Therefore, the requirement of alternative medicine is in high demand. Recently, allopathic medicines have seen a disinterest and people are preferring natural solutions due to their fewer side effects comparable to conventional medicine. Worldwide plants are utilized for various disease treatments such as bacterial infection, skin disorders, cancer, asthma, respiratory problems, etc. The presence of a wide range of phytocompounds in different plants provides an alternative to the pharmaceutical industries to counter the problem of bacterial infections. Different plants contain various phytochemicals that possess numerous therapeutic activities and provide a remedy to suppress various bacterial strains. Therefore, in this review, an overview of various plants and their phytocompounds which are responsible for antibacterial activity has been discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Garg", "ForeName": "Saksham", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, School of Engineering & Technology, Sharda University, Greater Noida, India"}], "LastName": "Roy", "ForeName": "Arpita", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32568018", "10.2174/1389201021666200622121249", "CPB-EPUB-107556"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
