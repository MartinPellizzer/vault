The investigations were carried out with different fractions of extracts from leaves of Digitalis lanata. These fractions differ in the composition of concomitant compounds. The solubility of digoxin from the extract fractions is increased up to 42 times, with considerable differences between the fractions. The solubility depends on the weight of the extract fraction; a limit of solubility exists. Even after separation of the solved extract components the solubility of digoxin in the residues is larger than that of the pure digoxin. The dissolution rate of digoxin of \"Vorgereinigter Gesamtglykosidextrakt (VE)\" and the glycosid fraction G 1 is influenced significantly, whereas digoxin in the glycosid fraction G 4 has such a degree of purity that the solubility properties are not influenced by the small amount of concomitant compounds. After 10 min already 50.4% of the digoxin in the extract fraction G 1 are dissolved, while only 21.7% of the pure digoxin are dissolved in that interval. The extract fractions exhibit different wettability properties, so that the increased dissolution rate could be attributed to improved wettability of the extract fractions. Physical mixtures of crystal-line digoxin and compounds of the extracts of the almost digoxin free fraction G 2 did not exert an influence on the dissolution behavior. Different batches of the extract fractions showed different solubility in spite of comparable digoxin content."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fachbereich Biologie, Chemie, Pharmazie-Institute f\u00fcr Pharmazie-der Freien Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eder", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mehnert", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "L\u00f6sungsverhalten von Digoxin in Gegenwart pflanzlicher Begleitstoffe aus Digitalis-lanata-Trockenextrakten.
