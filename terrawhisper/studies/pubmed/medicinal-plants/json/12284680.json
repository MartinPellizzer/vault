The domestication of plants and animals produced significant change in how we survived as a species. It ultimately led to civilization, cities, the division of labor, and population growth. Presently we face a paradox between controlling the development of tropical areas even though it was through such means that progress was made in the 1st place. The tropical regions are full of life. It is estimated that 95% of all species live in tropical areas. By 2000 over 66% of the human population will live in the tropics. The forests are already being destroyed and such projections of population growth will only increase their rate of loss. The loss of tropical forests has severe impacts and consequences. Because of their rich species diversity they must be seen as a rich storehouse of natural resources that must be protected. The potential for medicine and food from the tropical forests has just been tapped and what we know already should force us to stop destroying them. An example is the alkaloid compound DMDP which was found in the leaves of a Panamanian moth's larval food plant. DMDP is a fructose analog that is currently the subject of 5 active areas of research, 4 of which involve human diseases: obesity, diabetes, cancer, and AIDS. This is just 1 single find out of millions of potential beneficial species. The forces of destruction that harm tropical forests are slash and burn agriculture, timber extraction, fuel wood extraction, and pasture creation for beef production. The greatest threat to forests, however, is poverty. Land management and internal migration laws in many countries make it desirable for landless people to start small farms. As population grows, so does the need for this type of land. If any progress is to be made in stopping deforestation, progress toward social justice and equality of opportunity must precede it."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["069827", "00210576"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: INTEGRATION"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Deforestation", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Drugs", "Ecology", "Environment", "Environmental Degradation", "Geographic Factors", "Health", "Health Services", "Land Supply", "Medicine", "Natural Resources", "Plants, Medicinal", "Population", "Spatial Distribution", "Treatment", "World"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12284680", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "01"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "04"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0916-0582", "JournalIssue": {"Issue": "30", "PubDate": {"Year": "1991", "Month": "Dec"}}, "Title": "Integration (Tokyo, Japan)", "ISOAbbreviation": "Integration"}, "ArticleTitle": "Reverse the trend.
