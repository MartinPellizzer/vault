Another novel amino acid, (2S,1'S,2'S)-2-(2'-hydroxy-3'-cyclopentenyl)glycine (12), the stereochemistry of which was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, was shown to occur in species belonging to Flacourtiaceae, Passifloraceae, and Turneraceae. These species, many of which serve as hosts for nymphalid butterflies (Acraeinae, Heliconiinae, Argynninae), also produce 2-(2'-cyclopentenyl)glycine. Cyclopentenylglycines are proposed to be novel chemical recognition templates for plant-insect interactions. Ratios between the epimers of (2S)-2-(2'-cyclopentenyl)glycine, which co-occur in plants, were determined by (1)H NMR spectroscopy. Contrary to a previous report, the (2S,1'R) epimer always appears to predominate over the (2S,1'S) epimer. Stereochemical aspects of biosynthesis of natural cyclopentanoid cyanogenic glycosides are discussed in relation to these findings."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Royal Danish School of Pharmacy, Universitetsparken 2, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clausen", "ForeName": "Vicki", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frydenvang", "ForeName": "Karla", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koopmann", "ForeName": "Ricarda", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "J\u00f8rgensen", "ForeName": "Lise Bolt", "Initials": "LB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abbiw", "ForeName": "Daniel K", "Initials": "DK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ekpe", "ForeName": "Patrick", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jaroszewski", "ForeName": "Jerzy W", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "2-(2'-hydroxy-3'-cyclopentenyl)glycine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "cyclopentenylglycine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TE7660XO1C", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Butterflies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallography, X-Ray"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Feeding Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Passiflora"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11975497", "10.1021/np010572c", "np010572c"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
