Particularly, medicinal plants are a rich source of medicinal, cosmetic, sanitary, and aromatic substances. Genus Ferula from the Apiaceae family is a plant genus that possesses over 170 species, which have been carefully documented with regard to their medicinal properties. Ferula spp. affects many body organs, and their respective functions, in humans, such as the immune system, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary, endocrine, respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous system, bone (skeleton), and teeth. In spite of the benefits, ferulosis (Ferula toxicity) is an important aspect of Ferula consumption in humans and animals. Hemorrhagic problems and infertility are important signs of ferulosis. In this review, we have described all of the effects of the active ingredients of Ferula spp. and their mechanisms of actions, when known, based on an extensive literature review. Thus, our review opens a window of the benefits of Ferula as a phyto-pharmaceutical and its therapeutic applications in pharmacy, dentistry, and medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biotechnology, Agronomy and Plant Breeding Department, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sabzehzari", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biotechnology, Agronomy and Plant Breeding Department, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Naghavi", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bozari", "ForeName": "Motahare", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ahl Al Bayt, Karbala, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Orafai", "ForeName": "Hossein M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri, MO 64106, United States."}], "LastName": "Johnston", "ForeName": "Thomas P", "Initials": "TP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Halal Research Center of IRI, FDA, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sahebkar", "ForeName": "Amirhossein", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mini Rev Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101094212", "ISSNLinking": "1389-5575"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ferula"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32368975", "10.2174/1389557520666200505125618", "MRMC-EPUB-106380"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
