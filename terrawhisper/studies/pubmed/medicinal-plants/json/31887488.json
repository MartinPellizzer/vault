China is a typical high-As region, and also a great contributor of the world production of cultivated edible mushrooms and a region abundant in wild growing edible mushrooms. Mushrooms can accumulate different amounts of As and different As compounds, so potential health risk of As intake may exist to people who use mushrooms with elevated As contents as food or medicine. A systematic literature search was carried out for studies on As and As compounds in mushrooms from China. We compiled existing data from published sources in English or Chinese and provide an updated review of the findings on As in mushrooms associated with environments and health risks. Future perspectives for studies on As in mushrooms have also been discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
