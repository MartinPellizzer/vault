Over the last decade, VIGS has been widely used for conducting rapid gene knockdown experiment in plants and played a crucial role in advancing applied and basic research in plant science. VIGS was studied extensively in model plants Arabidopsis and tobacco. Moreover, several non-model plants such as Papaver (Hileman et al., Plant J 44:334-341, 2005), Aquilegia (Gould and Kramer, Plant Methods 3:6, 2007), Catharanthus (Liscombe and O'Connor, Phytochemistry 72:1969-1977, 2011), Withania (Singh et al., Plant Biol J 13:1287-1299, 2015), and Ocimum (Misra et al., New Phytol 214:706-720, 2017) were also successfully explored. We have recently developed a robust protocol for VIGS in sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum). Sweet basil, a popular medicinal/aromatic herb, is being studied for the diversity of specialized metabolites produced in it."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic Biology Department,, John Innes Centre, Norwich, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Misra", "ForeName": "Rajesh Chandra", "Initials": "RC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Shubha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Garg", "ForeName": "Anchal", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India. sumitghosh@cimap.res.in."}], "LastName": "Ghosh", "ForeName": "Sumit", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Methods Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9214969", "ISSNLinking": "1064-3745"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Agrobacterium"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Genomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nepovirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ocimum basilicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Viruses"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32557366", "10.1007/978-1-0716-0751-0_10"]}}]}
