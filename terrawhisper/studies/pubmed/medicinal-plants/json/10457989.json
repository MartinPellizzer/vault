During the period of 14 days 50 mG/kg per body weight of RoseOx was added to the diet of normal rats each day. Free radical oxidation in liver mitochondrial fraction was determined by the help of a chemiluminescence method. Four kinetic The RoseOx addition to the usual diet led for free radical oxidation braking in mitochondrial fraction of liver as was shown. The RoseOx antioxidizing effect was stipulated by availability of carnosic acid as a supplement. One of the mechanism of the caronosic acid antioxidizing action could be its participation in LFRO reactions breaking by its OH-groups. Carnosic acid contains OH-groups in its molecule as well as a vitamin E for example. So, the mechanism of carnosic acid antioxidizing action is probably similar to vitamin E action in lipid free radical oxidation reactions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "A.V.
