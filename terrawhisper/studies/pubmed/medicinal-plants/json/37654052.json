Sternb, the renowned pharmaceutical plant in Jammu and Kashmir of Pakistan, is widely applied in treating different illnesses including diabetes, diarrhea, and vomiting. This work employed an efficient one-step inner-recycling counter-current chromatography for preparative separating and purifying compounds with similar partition coefficients from the rhizome of Bergenia ciliate (haw.). Five compounds, including quercetin rhamnodiglucoside (1), quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (2), bergenine (3), kaempferol (4), and palmatic acid (5), were successfully separated using the optimized biphasic solvent system that contained ter-butylmetylether/n-butanol/acetonitrile/water (2:2:1:5, v/v) with the purities over 98%. Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance were conducted for structural identification. As a result, our proposed strategy might be applied in separating compounds with similar partition coefficients, which was advantageous with regard to the less solvent and time consumption, and the increased number of theoretical plates."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Shandong Academy of Sciences, Qilu University of Technology, Jinan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Mirpur University of Science and Technology, Mirpur, Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biological Engineering Technology Innovation Center of Shandong Province, Shandong Academy of Sciences, Heze Branch of Qilu University of Technology, Heze, China."}], "LastName": "Aziz", "ForeName": "Shahid", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Mirpur University of Science and Technology, Mirpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akhter", "ForeName": "Faheem", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioorganic Chemistry, Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry, Halle, Germany."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Hidayat", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heze Peony Development Service Center, Heze, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jiguo", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Shandong Academy of Sciences, Qilu University of Technology, Jinan, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Huijiao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Shandong Academy of Sciences, Qilu University of Technology, Jinan, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biological Engineering Technology Innovation Center of Shandong Province, Shandong Academy of Sciences, Heze Branch of Qilu University of Technology, Heze, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qixu", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biological Engineering Technology Innovation Center of Shandong Province, Shandong Academy of Sciences, Heze Branch of Qilu University of Technology, Heze, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Shandong Academy of Sciences, Qilu University of Technology, Jinan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biological Engineering Technology Innovation Center of Shandong Province, Shandong Academy of Sciences, Heze Branch of Qilu University of Technology, Heze, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Daijie", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Shandong Academy of Sciences, Qilu University of Technology, Jinan, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ZR2020MH396", "Agency": "Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2022JBZ02-06", "Agency": "post-doctoral fellowship and Science, Education, Industry Integration Innovation Pilot Project", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2022PX029", "Agency": "post-doctoral fellowship and Science, Education, Industry Integration Innovation Pilot Project", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2020-CXY16", "Agency": "University-Local IUR Collaborative Innovation Fund Project", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Science)", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "National Talented Young Scientists Programme (TYSP)", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "32200311", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Sep Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101088554", "ISSNLinking": "1615-9306"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Countercurrent Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Ruby K, Chauhan R, Sharma S, Dwivedi J.
