The antigenic specificity of anti-bupleuran 2IIc/PG-1-IgG was examined by a two-site sandwich ELISA which was developed as an improved method for microanalysis of bupleuran 2IIc using a biotinylated antibody. Another pectin from B. falcatum and anti-complementary pectins from Angelica acutilaba and Glycyrrhiza uralensis also showed significant reactivity to anti-bupleuran 2IIc/PG-1-IgG, although these reactivities were lower than that of bupleuran 2IIc. Other polysaccharides tested such as apple pectin, araban, yeast mannan, pullulan, etc., had negligible reactivity. The KDO-containing region and oligogalacturonides, which were obtained by endo-alpha-(1-->4)-polygalacturonase digestion of bupleuran 2IIc, were also not significantly recognized by anti-bupleuran 2IIc/PG-1-IgG. When bupleuran 2IIc was administered to the mice i.v., the polysaccharide disappeared from the circulation within 24 h and was mainly detected in the liver by the two-site sandwich ELISA. However the clearance of bupleuran 2IIc from the circulation was delayed by pretreatment with iota-carrageenan. When the crude polysaccharide fraction (BR-2), containing mainly bupleurans 2IIb and 2IIc from B.falcatum, was administrated orally to the mice, the polysaccharides were detected in the liver and Peyer's patch."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oriental Medicine Research Center, Kitasato Institute, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Sakurai", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsumoto", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kiyohara", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin G"}, {"RegistryNumber": "138726-08-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Bupleuran 2IIc"}, {"RegistryNumber": "89NA02M4RX", "NameOfSubstance": "Pectins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibody Formation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibody Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin G"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Pectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8792667", "10.1055/s-2006-957898"]}}]}
