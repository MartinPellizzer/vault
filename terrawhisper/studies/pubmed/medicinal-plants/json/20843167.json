To date, no single pharmacological agent has been developed to correct metabolic abnormalities associated with MetS. Use of indigenous medicinal plants as alternative medicines against MetS could be beneficial due to multiple therapeutic usage, easy availability, and relatively few side effects.", "To investigate the protective effect of Clerodendron glandulosum Coleb. (Verbenaceae) aqueous leaf extract (CgE) against experimentally induced MetS in rats.", "Changes in body weight, food and fluid intake, plasma glucose, insulin, fasting insulin resistance index (FIRI), plasma total lipid profile, free fatty acids (FFA), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), blood pressure and vascular reactivity have been investigated in various experimental groups.", "Fructose+CgE groups recorded significant decrement (P <0.05) in plasma glucose, insulin, FIRI, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, VLDL and FFA, whereas plasma HDL level was significantly increased (P <0.05) along with an efficient clearance of glucose during OGTT and lowered area under curve values. FRU+CgE groups also showed significantly decreased (P <0.05) mean arterial blood pressure along with decreased vasoconstriction and increased vasorelaxation in response to administration of various pharmacological agents. These results were comparable with metformin treated rats.", "C. glandulosum leaf extract ameliorates experimentally induced MetS by improving dyslipidemia and insulin resistance.", "This study provides the first pharmacological evidence for the protective role of C. glandulosum leaves against experimentally induced MetS. Thus, therapeutic use of C. glandulosum in controlling MetS is indicated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Phytotherapeutics and Metabolic Endocrinology, Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, The M.S.
