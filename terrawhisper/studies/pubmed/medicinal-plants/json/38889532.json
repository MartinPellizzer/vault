Despite applications of several nanoparticles in different industries, they show harmful effects on biological systems, especially in plants. Various mechanisms for the toxic effects of nanoparticles have already been proposed; however, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) molecules including radicals [(e.g., superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022\u2012</sup>), peroxyl (HOO<sup>\u2022</sup>), and hydroxyl (HO<sup>\u2022</sup>) and non-radicals [(e.g., hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) is more important. Excessive production/and accumulation of ROS in cells and subsequent induction of oxidative stress disrupts the normal functioning of physiological processes and cellular redox reactions. Some of the consequences of ROS overproduction include peroxidation of lipids, changes in protein structure, DNA strand breaks, mitochondrial damage, and cell death. Key enzymatic antioxidants with ROS scavenging ability comprised of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), peroxidase (POD), and glutathione reductase (GR), and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems including alpha-tocopherol, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, carotenoids, ascorbate, and glutathione play vital role in detoxification and maintaining plant health by balancing redox reactions and reducing the level of ROS. This review provides compelling evidence that phytotoxicity of nanoparticles, is mainly caused by overproduction of ROS after exposure. In addition, the present review also summarizes the intrinsic detoxification mechanisms in plants in response to nanoparticles accumulation within plant cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS.
