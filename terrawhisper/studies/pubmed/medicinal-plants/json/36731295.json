Six target compounds viz 22e, 22f, 23i, and 24b-d showed good osteogenic activity at 1\u00a0pM and 100\u00a0pM concentrations. One of the potential molecules, 24b, effectively induced ALP activity and mRNA expression of osteogenic marker genes at 1\u00a0pM and bone mineralization at 100\u00a0pM concentrations. These molecules also presented significant growth inhibition of osteosarcoma (MG63) and estrogen-dependent and -independent (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells. The most active compound, 24b, inhibited the growth of all the cancer cells within the IC<sub>50</sub> 10.45-12.66\u00a0\u00b5M. The mechanistic studies about 24b showed that 24b induced apoptosis via activation of the Caspase-3 enzyme and inhibited cancer cell migration. In silico molecular docking performed for 24b revealed its interaction with estrogen receptor-\u03b2 (ER-\u03b2) preferentially."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
