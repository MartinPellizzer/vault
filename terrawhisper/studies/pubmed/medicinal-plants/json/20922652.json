Since stimulation of insulin sensitivity appears to be a potential mechanism, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b3 is a likely target molecule for small lipophilic compounds derived from endogenous metabolism and nutrition. Functionally, PPAR \u03b3 integrates the control of energy, lipid, and glucose homeostasis. In addition, PPAR \u03b4 activity is involved in energy expenditure. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate whether PPAR \u03b3 and PPAR \u03b4 as well as the stimulation of glucose uptake is activated by botanical products. CISTUS SALVIFOLIUS (Cistaceae) has been identified as a candidate botanical in a preliminary screening of extracts from medicinal plants of Greek flora. In a bioguided approach, crude extracts, fractions and in the end purified compounds have been evaluated for PPAR \u03b3 and PPAR \u03b4 specific activities using cell-based transactivation assays. Glucose uptake was measured by nonradioactive 2-[ N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG) uptake. Concerning PPAR \u03b3 several extracts induced reporter gene activity, and clear dose-response patterns (0.1-100 \u00b5g/mL) could be established in the case of the cyclohexane and dichloromethane extracts. Isolation of individual compounds from the cyclohexane extract revealed that at least 6 out of 7 compounds isolated were active with TRANS-cinnamic acid showing a clear dose-response pattern. In contrast, they were found to be inactive on PPAR \u03b4. The same compounds, however, were also active in stimulating glucose uptake into 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In summary, the bioguided fractionation of CISTUS SALVIFOLIUS yields PPAR \u03b3 stimulating metabolites with differing chemical natures. In conclusion, PPAR \u03b3 represents a candidate molecule for the mediation of improvement of glucose metabolism by botanical/nutritional products."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Cell Physiology & Endocrinology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "K\u00fchn", "ForeName": "Claudia", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arapogianni", "ForeName": "Niki Eliza", "Initials": "NE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Halabalaki", "ForeName": "Maria", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hempel", "ForeName": "Jana", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hunger", "ForeName": "Nicole", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wober", "ForeName": "Jannette", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skaltsounis", "ForeName": "Alexios Leandros", "Initials": "AL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vollmer", "ForeName": "G\u00fcnter", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cinnamates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "PPAR delta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "PPAR gamma"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "140-10-3", "NameOfSubstance": "cinnamic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "3T3-L1 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adipocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cistus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Reporter"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greece"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Insulin Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "PPAR delta"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "PPAR gamma"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptional Activation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20922652", "10.1055/s-0030-1250382"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
