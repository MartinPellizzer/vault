Surgical removal of the prostate effectively cures the primary disease but the metastatic disease is refractory to most forms of chemotherapy. There is a clinical need to develop novel treatment strategies that exploit the mode of action of both conventional and alternative drugs/medicinal plants. We have been investigating the anti-proliferative and anti-tumor effects of an herbal preparation termed PC-SPES (patent pending, US serial number 08/697, 920) which is a refined powder of eight different medicinal plants. PC-SPES administered as a food supplement caused a dramatic decrease in prostate specific antigen levels in some prostate cancer patients with advanced disease. These preliminary clinical findings laid the foundation for a program to examine the in vitro and in vivo effects of PC-SPES, and identify the active component in this mixture so that a standardized treatment regimen can be formulated. In this communication, we report the anti-tumor effects of PC-SPES incorporated in the diet utilizing a well studied Dunning R3327 rat prostate cancer model. Dietary PC-SPES at levels of 0.05% and 0.025% did not exhibit any toxicity and no significant difference in food intake was noted at the end of six weeks. Dose dependent inhibitory effect of dietary PC-SPES was observed on both tumor incidence (P=0. 01) and rate of tumor growth when tumors were induced in syngeneic Copenhagen rats by intradermal injections of MAT-LyLu cells that are known to metastasize in the lung and lymph nodes. The number of pulmonary metastases in animals on PC-SPES that showed no primary tumor growth had no metastatic lesions in the lung, however, in animals that did not respond to PC-SPES, the number of pulmonary metastases was not significantly different from the non-treated controls. The significant anti-tumor effects of PC-SPES on MAT-LyLu induced tumorigenesis and metastasis in Copenhagen rats, in general refractory to most conventional therapy, suggests a therapeutic benefit of this herbal food supplement and may be a useful adjuvant to conventional therapeutic modalities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA."}], "LastName": "Tiwari", "ForeName": "R K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Geliebter", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Garikapaty", "ForeName": "V P", "Initials": "VP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yedavelli", "ForeName": "S P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mittelman", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Int J Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "9306042", "ISSNLinking": "1019-6439"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "herbal preparation PC-SPES"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["secondary"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Metastasis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Transplantation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Prostatic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10087319", "10.3892/ijo.14.4.713"]}}]}
