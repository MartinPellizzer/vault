Here, we reported its action on tumor invasion and metastasis in the human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2, aiming at a better understanding of the potential mechanism of action of Valjatrate E. HepG2 cells were treated with Valjatrate E at different concentrations. Wound healing assay and transwell chamber assay were used to determine the effects of Valjatrate E on the migration and invasiveness of HepG2 cells, respectively. Moreover, homogeneity and heterotypic adhesion experiments evaluated the adhesion property of HepG2 cells. The molecular mechanisms by which Valjatrate E inhibited the invasion and migration of HepG2 cells were investigated by gelatin zymography experiment and western blot. Treatment with Valjatrate E inhibited the migration and invasion of HepG2 cells. It achieved this by reducing the expression of matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9), by inhibition of heterogeneous adhesion ability, by blocking mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling via inhibiting the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (p-ERK). Taken together, these findings provide new evidence that mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathway plays an important role in promoting invasion and metastasis in HepG2 cells through p-ERK, and MAPK/ERK signaling pathway may be a therapeutic target for tumor."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
