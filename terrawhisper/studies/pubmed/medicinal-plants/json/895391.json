The optimal 2,4-D concentration for growth and alkaloid production was 1 mg/liter. With IAA, both 0.5 and 2.0 mg/liter in media produced tissue growth comparable to tissue receiving 1 mg/liter 2,4-D; however, qualitative and quantitative differences in alkaloid production were observed. Media formulations containing 2,4 and 6% sucrose showed proportionate increases in cell yield with increased sucrose, but concomitant decreases in alkaloid production. Suspension cultures in media containing 2, 5, and 10 times the normal level of phosphate exhibited little change in growth or alkaloid production. When thiamin HCl, yridoxine nicotinic acid and inositol were deleted from the medium, the tissue continued to grow well through the 24 month duration of the experiment; however, alkaloid production was altered quantitatively and qualitatively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Carew", "ForeName": "D P", "Initials": "DP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Krueger", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Lloydia", "NlmUniqueID": "0376626", "ISSNLinking": "0024-5461"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Macromolecular Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12001-76-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin B Complex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2577AQ9262", "NameOfSubstance": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4L6452S749", "NameOfSubstance": "Inositol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-50-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Sucrose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Inositol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macromolecular Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sucrose"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin B Complex"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["895391"]}}]}
