A. Braun and Aschers, has been used as a traditional Chinese medicinal herb for thousands of years for the treatments of rhinitis, sinusitis, cough and asthmatic diseases. This review aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of CM by summarizing its phytochemistry, pharmacology, clinical application and safety.", "This review summarizes the published studies on CM in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and literature databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Baidu Scholar, Wiley and China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI), as well as the research articles on the phytochemistry, pharmacology, clinical application and safety of CM.", "A total of 191 compounds have been isolated and identified from CM, including terpenes, flavonoids, sterols, phenols, organic acids and volatile oils. In addition, the pharmacological effects of CM, such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial activities, have also been evaluated by both in vitro and in vivo studies. The signaling pathways and mechanisms of action underlying the anti-cancer effects of CM have been revealed. Clinical applications of CM mainly include rhinitis and sinusitis, gynecological inflammation, cough, as well as asthma.", "CM is a medicinal herb that possesses many therapeutic effects. Cutting-edge technology and system biology could provide us a more comprehensive understanding of the therapeutic effects, constituting components and toxicity of CM, which are the prerequisites for its translation into therapeutics for various disease treatments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
