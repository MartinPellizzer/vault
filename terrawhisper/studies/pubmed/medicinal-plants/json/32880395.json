Leaves and roots of W. somnifera were collected from different treated groups viz. control, KJ, PG, farmyard manure (FYM) and inorganic fertilizer (NPK). Reverse phase ultra-flow liquid chromatography (RP-UFLC) method was developed, validated for simultaneous detection of WFA, WIA and WIB. Statistical analysis of data was performed by ANOVA and tested for significance by the Dunnett multiple comparison test and data were expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation (SD). Results revealed, leaves possessed highest WFA content and roots possessed highest content of WIA and WIB. PG treated leaves were observed highest WFA (18.29\u00a0mg/g) and roots were observed highest WIA (19.63\u00a0mg/g) and WIB (1.36\u00a0mg/g). Conclusively, RP-UFLC method for simultaneous detection of withanolides has been developed and validated to evaluate the effect of traditional horticulture treatments. It is concluded that the enhanced production of withanolides can be achieved by the application of PG when compared to NPK application."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.
