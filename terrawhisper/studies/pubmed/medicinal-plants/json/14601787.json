The four plants used for this screening were Ocimum sauve, Ocimum lamiifolium, Lippia adoensis and Ajuga remota.", "All extracts of the four plant materials were observed to possess both inhibiting and treatment activities against acetic acid induced pain. Dose related analgesic effect was also observed with all extracts of all plants with different potencies. Ethanol extracts of all the four plant materials were more potent than their water extracts at all dose levels except O. sauve, and L. adoensis whose water extracts seem to be a bit more potent at low dose. The analgesic potencies of both extracts of all the four plants were shown to be less than those of the standard analgesics. Of all the extracts, the ethanol extract of O. lamiifolium was found to be the most potent, while its water extract was the least. Acetic acid induced writhing was relieved with medium dose of both extracts in most cases and with low dose in few. Hundred percent relief was achieved with both standard analgesics at a very low dose.", "The present study show that all the extracts of all the plant materials have got both inhibiting and relieving effects of pain."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Drug Research, Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research Institute, P.O.
