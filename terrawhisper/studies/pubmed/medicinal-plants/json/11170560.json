More than 1000 samples of global origin collected over four years were analyzed on amino acids following the official methods of the United States and the European Union. Detailed data and graphics are given to characterize the obtained calibration equations. NIRS was validated with independent samples for soy and meat meal products and compared to the amino acid predictions using linear crude protein regressions. With a few exceptions, validation showed that 85-98% of the amino acid variance in the samples could be explained using NIRS. NIRS predictions compared to reference results agree excellently, with relative mean deviations below 5%. Especially for meat and poultry meals, NIRS can predict amino acids much better than crude protein regressions. By enabling the amino acid analysis of many samples to be completed in a short time, NIRS can improve the accuracy of feed formulation and thus the quality and production costs of mixed feeds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Degussa-H\u00fcls AG Feed Additives Division, Applied Technology, P.O.
