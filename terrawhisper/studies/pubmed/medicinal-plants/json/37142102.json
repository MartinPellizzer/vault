Magnetic mesoporous anatase titanium dioxide (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@mTiO<sub>2</sub>) was synthesized by microwave-assisted hydrothermal, and Ag NPs were simultaneously in-situ grown on Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@mTiO<sub>2</sub> (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@mTiO<sub>2</sub>@Ag), graphene oxide (GO) was then wrapped on Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@mTiO<sub>2</sub>@Ag (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@mTiO<sub>2</sub>@Ag@GO) to increase its adsorption capacity for fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs). Owing to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of Ag, as well as the photocatalytic capacity of TiO<sub>2</sub>, a multifunctional platform based on Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@mTiO<sub>2</sub>@Ag@GO was constructed for adsorption, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) monitoring and photodegradation of FQs in water. The quantitative SERS detection of norfloxacin (NOR), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and enrofloxacin (ENR) was demonstrated with LOD of 0.1\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>, and the qualitative analysis was confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The photocatalytic degradation rate of NOR over Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@mTiO<sub>2</sub>@Ag@GO was about 4.6 and 1.4 times faster than that of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@mTiO<sub>2</sub> and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@mTiO<sub>2</sub>@Ag, indicating the synergetic effects of Ag NPs and GO, the used Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@mTiO<sub>2</sub>@Ag@GO can be easily recovered and recycled for at least 5 times. Thus, the eco-friendly magnetic plasmonic photocatalyst provided a potential solution for the removal and monitoring of residual FQs in environmental water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
