Finally, 27 medicinal materials were screened out, involving 71 species(varieties). Among them, only 11 are recorded in Chinese Pharmacopoeia(2020), National Standard for Chinese Patent Drugs\u00b7Tibetan Medicine, Tibetan Medicine Standards, and other local standards, including Corydalis Bungeanae Herba and Corydalis Herba. The names and original plants of the medicinal materials are different in different standards, and the phenomena of &quot;same medicinal material with different names&quot; and &quot;same name for different medicinal materials&quot; are prominent. Most standards only include the traits, microscopic identification, and physico-chemical property identification, with unsound quality criteria. Thus, efforts should be made to strengthen the sorting of Corydalis medicinal plants, herbal textual research, and investigation of the resources and utilization. Moreover, via modern techniques, the chemical components and medicinal material basis of different original plants should be explored and sound quality standards should be established to improve the safety and quality of Corydalis-derived medicinal materials. Summarizing Corydalis medicinal plants, Corydalis-derived medicinal materials, and related standards, this study is expected to provide a reference for the standard formulation, quality evaluation, expansion of drug sources, and rational development and utilization of Corydalis resources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hui-Min", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Feng-Chao", "Initials": "FC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jia-Chen", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137, China School of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Gui-Hua", "Initials": "GH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Lian", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Corydalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Tibetan Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "3"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35531743", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220115.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
