Experimental constraints did not permit pre-fixation in space with a cytostatic agent but arrest was achieved in the first division cycle on Earth after recovery. The number of cells in division was significantly depressed in all three species. Several chromosomal abnormalities were encountered in flight material. Bridge formation was seen in sunflower, as was aneuploidy. Breakage and fracture of chromosomes was prevalent in oats. No aberrant features could be detected in the chromosomes of mung bean. These results, although preliminary, should serve to alert investigators of the need to assess carefully as many aspects of cell division in higher plants exposed to space flight conditions as possible."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, State University of New York at Stony Brook 11794, USA."}], "LastName": "Krikorian", "ForeName": "A D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "O'Connor", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "NSG-7270", "Acronym": "NS", "Agency": "NINDS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ann Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "0372347", "ISSNLinking": "0305-7364"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aneuploidy"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Avena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Aberrations"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Helianthus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Karyotyping"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Space Flight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weightlessness"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11538823", "10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a086866"]}}]}
