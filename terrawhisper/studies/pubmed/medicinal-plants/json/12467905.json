Six isoquinoline alkaloids namely berberine, berbamine, palmatine, oxyacanthine, magnoflorine, and columbamine were isolated as the main components of alkaloidal fraction from the roots of Turkish Berberis species and effects were studied using various in vivo models in mice. All alkaloids inhibited inflammations in varying degrees, among them berberine, berbamine and palmatine were shown to possess significant and dose-dependent inhibitory activity against serotonin-induced hind paw oedema both on oral and topical applications and acetic acid-induced increase in vascular permeability on oral administration. Moreover, these three alkaloids were also shown to possess dose-dependent antinociceptive activity, which assessed by using the model based on the inhibition of p-benzoquinone-induced writhing movements as well as antipyretic activity on FCA-induced increased rectal temperature on subacute administration. However, all alkaloids induced gastric lesions in varying degrees."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gazi University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Etiler 06330, Ankara, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "K\u00fcpeli", "ForeName": "Esra", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ko\u015far", "ForeName": "M\u00fcberra", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye\u015filada", "ForeName": "Erdem", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "H\u00fcsn\u00fc", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ba\u015fer", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375521", "ISSNLinking": "0024-3205"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoquinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JGX76Y85M6", "NameOfSubstance": "isoquinoline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Berberis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Isoquinolines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12467905", "10.1016/s0024-3205(02)02200-2", "S0024320502022002"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
