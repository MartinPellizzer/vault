The VAM inoculation significantly increased the root colonization, plant height, fresh herbage and dry matter yield. oil content and oil yield as compared to non-inoculated cultivars. The effect of VAM inoculation on the root colonization, growth and yield of mint was more pronounced with the cv Shivalik than the cvs Kalka and Gomati, indicating Shivalik as a highly mycorrhizal dependent genotype. VAM inoculation significantly increased the uptake of N, P and K by shoot tissues of mint, but most markedly increased the uptake of P. The VAM-inoculated mint plants depleted the available N, P and K in the rhizosphere soil as compared to non-inoculated control plants, however the extent of nutrient depletion was greater for P than N and K. We conclude that the VAM inoculation could significantly increase the root colonization, growth, essential oil yield and nutrient acquisition of mint for obtaining economic production under field conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prasad", "ForeName": "Arun", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ram", "ForeName": "Muni", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Sushil", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Bioresour Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9889523", "ISSNLinking": "0960-8524"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1490-04-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Menthol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Mentha"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Menthol"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11708758", "10.1016/s0960-8524(01)00109-2", "S0960-8524(01)00109-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
