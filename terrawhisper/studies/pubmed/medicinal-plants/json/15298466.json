The reasons for giving the herbal preparations were stated in only 52 cases (33.3%), of which five were for diarrhoea and vomiting, four for constipation and abdominal pain, three to change stool colour, and 41 for \"playte\" (generic term given to all types of ill health). The preparations were administered orally (n=95), by enema (n=12), and both orally and by enema (n= 12), while route of administration was not stated in 37 of the cases. Sixty eight (43.6%) of the children died, 84 (53.8%) improved, while the fate of four (2.6%) was not indicated. Most of the deaths (63.2%) were among the zero to six months age group, and most deaths occurred within two days of admission. The average duration of stay (days) in hospital was 2.94 +/- 0.65 (range 1 to 39) for the group that succumbed and 8.88 +/- 0.73 (range 1 to 40) for the survivors (p < 0.001).", "There is a high mortality rate among children admitted with suspicion of herbal intoxication, and there is need to manage such children with vigilance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Transkei, Republic of South Africa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tindimwebwa", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dambisya", "ForeName": "Y M", "Initials": "YM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Zimbabwe", "MedlineTA": "Cent Afr J Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0372566", "ISSNLinking": "0008-9176"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cough"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dyspnea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fever"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospital Mortality"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Hospitals, General"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Hospitals, Teaching"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant Mortality"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Patient Admission"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Surveillance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Survival Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Vomiting"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15298466"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
