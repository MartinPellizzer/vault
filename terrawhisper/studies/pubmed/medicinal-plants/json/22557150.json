Is on the verge of extinction and needs to be conserved and cultivated. Large variations are also observed in the quality of the crude drug available in the market. Study on the quality of C. orchioides in natural habitat, under cultivation and in trade in south India showed that there was considerable variation with biotypes and habitats. Drugs collected form the natural habitat was superior in quality to that produced by cultivation. Among the market samples collected from the various Zones of kerala, those from the High Ranges were superior in most of the quality parameters, which indicated its superiority for high quality drug formulation. Among the southern states, Tamil Nadu samples ranked next to High Range samples in this respect. There exists large variability in the market samples and there is felt-need for proper standardization of the crude drug for ensuring quality in the drug formulations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aromatic and Medicinal Plants Research Station, Odakkali, Asamonnoor - 683 549, Kerala, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mathew", "ForeName": "P P Joy Samuel", "Initials": "PP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Savithri", "ForeName": "K E", "Initials": "KE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skaria", "ForeName": "Baby P", "Initials": "BP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kurien", "ForeName": "Kochurani", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Anc Sci Life", "NlmUniqueID": "8307589", "ISSNLinking": "0257-7941"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22557150", "PMC3330908"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
