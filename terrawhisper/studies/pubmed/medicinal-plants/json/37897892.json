Due to sessile nature, these plants are constantly exposed to damaging radiation, which disturbs their natural physiological and biochemical processes. To combat with UV stress, plants synthesized several small organic molecules (natural products of low molecular mass like alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids and phenolics, etc.) known as plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) that come into play to counteract the adverse effect of stress. Plants adapted a stress response by organizing the expression of several genes, enzymes, transcription factors, and proteins involved in the synthesis of chemical substances and by making the signaling cascade (a series of chemical reactions induced by a stimulus within a biological cell) flexible to boost the defensive response. To neutralize UV exposure, secondary metabolites and their signaling network regulate cellular processes at the molecular level. Conventional breeding methods are time-consuming and difficult to reveal the molecular pattern of the stress tolerance medicinal plants. Acquiring in-depth knowledge of the molecular drivers behind the defensive mechanism of medicinal plants against UV radiation would yield advantages (economical and biological) that will bring prosperity to the burgeoning world's population. Thus, this review article emphasized the comprehensive information and clues to identify several potential genes, transcription factors (TFs), proteins, biosynthetic pathways, and biological networks which are involved in resilience mechanism under UV stress in medicinal plants of high-altitudes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
