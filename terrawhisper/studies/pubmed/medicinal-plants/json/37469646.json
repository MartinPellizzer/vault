In this collection of literature, we have encountered and presented the preclinical treatment, as alternative medicine of <i>Nigella sativa</i> in the prevention and treatment of various diseases, as well as those that continue to be discovered by contemporary actual scientific data. Research to date has confirmed the pharmacological potential of the seed of <i>Nigella sativa</i>, its oil and extracts of some of its bioactive constituents, which possess remarkable pharmacological activity, <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> against a large spectrum of diseases, and it has been found that the use of black seed is relatively safe. Black Seed has been extensively studied for its biological activity and therapeutic potential and has been found to possess a broad spectrum of activities. Clinical trial investigations into the therapeutic effects of <i>Nigella sativa</i> affect the hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, and bronchodilator effects and have passed clinical trials and received the green light to allow the next stage of clinical trials toward therapeutic drug design. However, there is still room and multidimensional research needed for prospective clinical trials in certain groups of animals before they can be applied to humans as pharmaceutical therapies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2023 Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Premedical Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Prishtina, 10000 Prishtine, Kosovo, Albania."}], "LastName": "Ferizi", "ForeName": "Rrahman", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Nutrition, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah 21955, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ramadan", "ForeName": "Mohamed F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, College of Medical Sciences Rezonanca, 10000 Prishtine, Kosovo, Albania."}], "LastName": "Maxhuni", "ForeName": "Qenan", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Bioallied Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101537209", "ISSNLinking": "0975-7406"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have no conflicts of interest regarding this investigation."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Hosseinzadeh H, Moghim FF, Mansouri SMT.
