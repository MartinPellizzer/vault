These foods contain organosulfur compounds that are known to affect the biotransformation of xenobiotics, and therefore can influence the toxicity and carcinogenicity of environmental chemicals. In this article, we review the effects of isothiocyanates and diallyl sulfide on xenobiotic metabolism and the enzymes involved in the process. Isothiocyanates and diallyl sulfide can modulate the levels of phase I and phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes by affecting the transcriptional rates of their genes, the turnover rates of specific mRNAs or enzymes, or the enzyme activity. These compounds are not general enzyme inhibitors or inducers. They elicit selectivity in their mode of action. Elucidating the mechanisms involved in the alteration of drug-metabolizing enzymes by isothiocyanates and diallyl sulfide will increase our understanding of their possible effects on the biotransformation of drugs as well as the potential beneficial or detrimental effects of these organosulfur compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Basic Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of South Carolina, Columbia 29208, USA. smithtj@pharm.sc.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "C S", "Initials": "CS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES03938", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES05693", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Drug Metabol Drug Interact", "NlmUniqueID": "8904736", "ISSNLinking": "0792-5077"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isothiocyanates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xenobiotics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Transferases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Brassicaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Isothiocyanates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Transferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Xenobiotics"}], "NumberOfReferences": "123"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11201297", "10.1515/dmdi.2000.17.1-4.23"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
