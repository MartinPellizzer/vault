Following extraction with 80% ethanol, highest recoveries of diosgenin occurred when hydrolyses were conducted in sulfuric acid, prepared at 1 molar (M) concentration in water containing 60-80% 2-propanol. Compared to a previous method with aqueous hydrochloric acid, the selected conditions of hydrolysis at 100 degrees C for 2 h with sulfuric acid in 70% 2-propanol reduced diene formation but did not completely eliminate these artifacts. Extraction of steroidal saponins with various alcohol/water mixtures prior to sulfuric acid hydrolysis gave similar recoveries of diosgenin. Application of the quantitative method to experimental samples of Amber, Quatro, and ZT-5 fenugreek, using 10 mg subsamples of crushed seed that had been defatted with petroleum ether and dried at 60 degrees C, gave diosgenin levels of 0.55, 0.42, and 0.75%, respectively. Levels of smilagenin and sarsasapogenin were very low in hydrolyzed seed extracts from ZT-5, a Canadian breeder line of fenugreek."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Research Centre, 107 Science Place, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada S7N 0X2. taylorw@em.agr.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taylor", "ForeName": "W G", "Initials": "WG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elder", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "P R", "Initials": "PR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Richards", "ForeName": "K W", "Initials": "KW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "68990-15-8", "NameOfSubstance": "fenugreek seed meal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K49P2K8WLX", "NameOfSubstance": "Diosgenin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Diosgenin"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Microchemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trigonella"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11087460", "10.1021/jf000467t", "jf000467t"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
