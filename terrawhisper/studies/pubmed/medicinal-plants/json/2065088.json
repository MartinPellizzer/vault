This inhibited state was only partially reversed even with high concentrations of DTT. Glutathione, a naturally occurring reducing thiol agent, was ineffective. The substrate, HMG CoA, but not NADPH, was able to give partial protection for the DTT-dependent, but not glutathione-dependent activity. The garlic-derived diallyl disulfide is the most effective among the sulfides tested for inhibition of HMG CoA reductase. Formation of protein internal disulfides, inaccessible for reduction by thiol agents, but not of protein dimer, is likely to be the cause of this inactivation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "R V", "Initials": "RV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Banerji", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kurup", "ForeName": "C K", "Initials": "CK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ramasarma", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biochim Biophys Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0217513", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "53-59-8", "NameOfSubstance": "NADP"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5HI47O6OA7", "NameOfSubstance": "diallyl disulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T8ID5YZU6Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Dithiothreitol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disulfides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dithiothreitol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NADP"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2065088", "10.1016/0167-4838(91)90561-d", "0167-4838(91)90561-D"]}}]}
