Analyzed by POPGENE, the average percentage of polymorphic loci was 58.86%. Nei's genetic diversity (H = 0.2647) and Shannon's information index (I = 0.4022) indicated that Lonicera confusa had a higher level of genetic diversity. The high value of differentiation( G(st) = 0.3839) showed that geographic isolation strongly influenced genetic differentiation among populations and there was a significant correlation between genetic distance and geographic distance (r = 0.8504, P = 96.80%). The clustering analysis was performed using softwares POPGENE and NTSYS-pc. Five populations were divided into 2 clusters, named cluster 1 (LFS, XX and NN) and cluster 2 (XW and HK).", "Management strategies were proposed for species conservation and resource utilization of Lonicera confusa, including the protection from human disturbance to facilitate natural regeneration, construction of germplasm resources and cultivation of plants collected from different populations, in order to select elite lines for good agricultural practice (GAP) of medicinal materials."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China. ihepu@126.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mo", "ForeName": "Ai-Qiong", "Initials": "AQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Geng", "ForeName": "Shi-Lei", "Initials": "SL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shou-Zhou", "Initials": "SZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cluster Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetics, Population"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Lonicera"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19645229"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
