Adult male Wistar rats were submitted to either a SNx (n = 18) or a sham operation (n = 10). Thirty days after SNx, nine SNx and five sham operated rats were given aqueous rhubarb roots extract (150 mg/day) in drinking water. The rats were followed up for 120 days. Rhubarb treatment had no effect on the systemic hypertension observed in SNx rats. Rhubarb-tested SNx rats had significantly less proteinuria 90 days (172 +/- 63 mg/24 h) and 120 days (228 +/- 92 mg/24 h) after SNx when compared to untreated SNx controls (day 90, 246 +/- 80 mg/24 h; day 120, 335 +/- 113 mg/24 h, P < 0.05). Renal function was comparable in rhubarb-treated and untreated SNx rats. However, at sacrifice the severity of glomerulosclerosis was significantly reduced in SNx rats treated with rhubarb (2.03 +/- 0.44; SNx controls, 2.58 +/- 0.53, P < 0.05). The difference in tubulointerstitial scarring between the two groups did not reach significance. Our results suggest that rhubarb extract reduces proteinuria and the severity of glomerulosclerosis in rats with remnant kidneys."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sheffield Kidney Institute, UK."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "el Nahas", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nephrol Dial Transplant", "NlmUniqueID": "8706402", "ISSNLinking": "0931-0509"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Nephrol Dial Transplant 1996 Apr;11(4):753"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Failure, Chronic"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Proteinuria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rheum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8649632"]}}]}
