Several medicinal plants have been used globally for the management of diabetes mellitus. The current study aimed to study the antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic effects of Bersama abyssinica.", "Antidiabetic effect of 80% methanolic crude extract of Bersama abyssinica was studied in a repeated dose-treated STZ-induced diabetic mice model. The activities of Bersama abyssinica on serum lipid level and body weight were investigated on STZ-induced diabetic mice. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and were significant when the p-value was less than 0.05.", "All doses of the crude 80% methanolic extract of Bersama abyssinica (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg) exhibited a noticeable BGL reduction when compared with baseline blood glucose level and diabetic control on the 7th and 14th days of administration. Moreover, higher dose of the extract (at 400 mg/kg) significantly (p < 0.001, 54.3%) decreased the BGL in STZ-induced diabetic mice. The maximum decrement in fasting BGL was achieved at the 14th days: 34.92%, 41.10%, 54.30%, and 59.66%, respectively for BAC 100 mg/kg, BAC 200 mg/kg, BAC 400 mg/kg, and GLC 5 mg/kg treated groups. Bersama abyssinica also displayed a significant (p < 0.05) improvement of serum lipid levels and body weight.", "Bersama abyssinica crude extract exhibited a significant antidiabetic effect and prevented body weight loss in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. The finding also confirmed the valuable biochemical activity of Bersama abyssinica by improving serum lipid levels."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Kifle", "ForeName": "Zemene Demelash", "Initials": "ZD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Lumame Primary Hospital, Lumame, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Alehegn", "ForeName": "Agumas Alemu", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Bahir Dar Health Science College, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Adugna", "ForeName": "Baye Yrga", "Initials": "BY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Mekuria", "ForeName": "Abebe Basazn", "Initials": "AB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Human Anatomy, School of Medicine, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Gondar, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Enyew", "ForeName": "Engidaw Fentahun", "Initials": "EF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Cardiovasc Hematol Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101266881", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5257"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34313203", "10.2174/1871525719666210726114802", "CHAMC-EPUB-116843"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
