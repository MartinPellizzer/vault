Seventeen patients were studied during July-August 1996. The age of affected individuals varied from 3 to 75 years. Members who had not consumed food cooked in mustard oil or who were not residing with the family were spared. Mustard oil, which was used for cooking, was found to be contaminated with oil of Argemone mexicana seeds. Sanguinarine was detected in all mustard oil samples collected from the homes of affected families. Gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 82 per cent of cases a week or so prior to the onset of pedal oedema. Pitting oedema of the lower limbs, fever, and darkening of the skin were the most consistent features, found in all cases. Other prominent features such as local erythema (82 per cent) and tenderness (88 per cent) of the lower limbs were present in most cases. Two striking features not previously noted were perianal itching (100 per cent) and severe carditis (35 per cent) with congestive cardiac failure (29 per cent). Other unique features noted were 'sarcoid' skin changes (18 per cent), bilateral pleural effusion, and Roth's spots and subhyloid haemorrhages in the fundus in one patient. Other important findings were anaemia (88 per cent), hepatomegaly (41 per cent), pneumonia (35 per cent) and ascites (12 per cent). There were no deaths due to epidemic dropsy. In the majority of cases, oedema, cutaneous changes, and carditis showed a marked improvement in 2-3 weeks and patients were well after 6-8 weeks of follow-up."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Paediatrics, B.P.
