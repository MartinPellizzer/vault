Also influence of antihomotoxic remedies on sacculo-collic reflex function were followed. Treatment concerned 23 ills that is 20 women and 3 men in age from 20 to 68 years, average age being 46,82 years. The studied population included 8 patients were diagnosed to have Meniere's disease, 5 ills suffered from neuronitis vestibularis, 5 patients complained of vertigo of vertebrobasilar arterial insufficiency. 3 patients were diagnosed to have vertigo after head trauma, 1 patient suffered from benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and one's cause of disease was unknown. Patients with tumor of ponto-cerebellaris angle or VIII nerve were excluded. Registration of VEMPs was done in all patients treated before starting and after stopping therapy. After using of Cerebrum comp. improvement of vestibulo-spinal reflex function was affirmed in the form of shorted latencies and higher amplitudes of VEMPs in the most patients. Using sublingually of Vertigoheel distinct greater amplitudes were observed in significant numbers of patients after therapy. Administered of placebo did not essential influence on values of VEMPs parameters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morawiec-Bajda", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wasilewski", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Miogenne przedsionkowe potencja\u0142y wywo\u0142ane zastosowane jako obiektywna ocena skuteczno\u015bci lek\u00f3w o dzia\u0142aniu o\u015brodkowym."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Otolaryngol Pol", "NlmUniqueID": "0404453", "ISSNLinking": "0030-6657"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Central Nervous System Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vertigoheel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "124-87-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrotoxin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Evoked Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Meniere Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Picrotoxin"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Vestibule, Labyrinth"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10917061"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
