Oxidative stress is critical in liver injury, and oxidant\u2011induced liver injury may be caused by toxins, including tert\u2011butyl hydroperoxide (t\u2011BHP). The present study investigated the hepatoprotective activities of 64 crude ethanol extracts of Cambodian medicinal plants against t\u2011BHP\u2011induced cytotoxicity in human liver\u2011derived HepG2 cells, and assessed their cytoprotective mechanism pertaining to the expression of heme oxygenase (HO)\u20111 and nuclear factor E2\u2011related factor 2 (Nrf2). Protective effects in HepG2 cells were determined by MTT assay. Protein expression levels of HO\u20111 and Nrf2 were determined by western blotting and mRNA expression levels were determined by reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Of the 64\u00a0extracts, 19 extracts exhibited high hepatoprotective activities: Ampelocissus martini, Bauhinia bracteata, Bombax ceiba, Borassus flabellifer, Cardiospermum halicacabum, Cayratia trifolia, Cinnamomum caryophyllus, Cyperus rotundus, Dasymaschalon lomentaceum, Ficus benjamina, Mangifera duperreana, Morinda citrifolia, Pandanus humilis, Peliosanthes weberi, Phyllanthus emblica, Quisqualis indica, Smilax glabra, Tinospora crispa and Willughbeia cochinchinensis, with half maximal effective concentrations ranging between 59.23 and 157.80\u00a0\u00b5g/ml. Further investigations revealed that, of these 19 extracts, HO\u20111 and Nrf2 were expressed in P. weberi and T. crispa expressed in a dose\u2011dependent manner. In addition, the activities of reactive oxygen species were suppressed following treatment of these two extracts in t\u2011BHP\u2011induced HepG2 cells. These results indicated that, of the 64 Cambodian plants, P. weberi and T.\u00a0crispa exhibited hepatoprotective effects on t\u2011BHP\u2011induced cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells, possibly by the induction of Nrf2\u2011mediated expression of HO\u20111. Taken together, these results suggested that T.\u00a0crispa or P.\u00a0weberi may offer potential for therapeutic applications in liver disease characterized by oxidative stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Chosun University, Dong\u2011gu, Gwangju 61452, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Dong-Sung", "Initials": "DS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 54538, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Keo", "ForeName": "Samell", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Health Sciences, Phnom Penh 12201, Cambodia."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Sun-Kaing", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 54538, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "Hyuncheol", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 54538, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Youn-Chul", "Initials": "YC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Mol Med Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "101475259", "ISSNLinking": "1791-2997"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-E2-Related Factor 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NFE2L2 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "955VYL842B", "NameOfSubstance": "tert-Butylhydroperoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Heme Oxygenase-1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Heme Oxygenase-1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hep G2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-E2-Related Factor 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "tert-Butylhydroperoxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27959441", "10.3892/mmr.2016.6011"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
