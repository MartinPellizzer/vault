Due to acidophilic nature of tea plant, it has inherent tendency to uptake metals/metalloids including the toxic ones from the soil which is of great concern worldwide. In this study, level of chromium (Cr) and arsenic (As) were assessed in four hundred ninety-seven (497) black tea samples collected from six tea growing regions of Assam and North Bengal, India. The average concentration of Cr and As in the tested black tea samples was 10.33 and 0.11\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Since tea is consumed as a beverage, transfer of Cr and As from black tea to its hot water extract (also known as tea infusion)\u00a0was also accessed. The amount of Cr and As determined in the tea infusion was much less (<\u20090.20 to 1.38\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> for Cr and <\u20093.60 to 34.79\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> for As) than those in the black teas with the transfer rate up to 5.96% and 8.53%, respectively. The present study showed that values of hazard quotient were well below one suggesting that intake of Cr and As from consumption of five cups of tea equivalent to 10\u00a0g black tea would not impose any health hazard."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Analytical Services Department, Tocklai Tea Research Institute, Jorhat, Assam, 785008, India."}], "LastName": "Barman", "ForeName": "Tupu", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Analytical Services Department, Tocklai Tea Research Institute, Jorhat, Assam, 785008, India."}], "LastName": "Barooah", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cotton University, Guwahati, Assam, 781001, India."}], "LastName": "Goswami", "ForeName": "B C", "Initials": "BC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Analytical Services Department, Tocklai Tea Research Institute, Jorhat, Assam, 785008, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Nipom", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Ocean Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, 1 Castle Point Terrace, Hoboken, NJ, 07030, USA."}], "LastName": "Panja", "ForeName": "Saumik", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agronomy-Soil Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, P.O.-CIMAP, Near Kukrail Picnic Spot, Lucknow, 226 015, India."}], "LastName": "Khare", "ForeName": "Puja", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4179-2529"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Ocean Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, 1 Castle Point Terrace, Hoboken, NJ, 07030, USA. t.karak@tocklai.net."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Upper Assam Advisory Centre, Tea Research Association, Dikom, Assam, 786 101, India. t.karak@tocklai.net."}], "LastName": "Karak", "ForeName": "Tanmoy", "Initials": "T"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "XI plan project on studies on heavy metals - Phase II - chromium and arsenic", "Agency": "Tea Board of India, Ministry of Commerce, Govt. of India", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "BT/20/NE/2011", "Agency": "Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biol Trace Elem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7911509", "ISSNLinking": "0163-4984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0R0008Q3JB", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N712M78A8G", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Arsenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Camellia sinensis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chromium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31506911", "10.1007/s12011-019-01889-y", "10.1007/s12011-019-01889-y"]}}]}
