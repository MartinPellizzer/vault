In this study, guided by HPLC-UV screening, 46 DIAPs (approximately 70% of all DIAPs) including 20 new ones and an unprecedented architecture, were discovered from the roots of Hypericum henryi, which were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic, X-ray crystallography, and ECD methods. Compounds 1-7, 39, and 41-42 exhibited remarkable cytotoxicities (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.84-5.63\u00a0\u03bcM) in human colon cancer HCT116\u00a0cells, in which 2 and 6 possessed selective cytotoxicities towards colon cancer cells. The preliminary structure-activity relationships of these tested compounds were discussed. In addition, mechanistic investigations demonstrated that 2 and 6 could significantly suppress the expressions of NF\u03baB, FAT1, and promoted novel tumor suppressor gene PDCD4 in HCT116\u00a0cells. Furthermore, in HCT116 colon xenograft-bearing mouse model, treatments with 2 and 6 reduced the growth of xenograft tumors in dose-dependent manner. Expressions of FAT1 in tumors were also decreased in mice treated with 2 and 6, suggesting their anti-tumor effects were via FAT1 signaling pathway. In conclusion, this is the first report on the mechanistic and in vivo studies of DIAP, indicating that these metabolites can be considered as a new type of anti-colon cancer lead agents for further drug development."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.
