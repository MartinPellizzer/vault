As the most important secondary metabolite in Parispolyphylla var. yunnanensis (Franch.) Hand. -Mzt. (PPY), Paris saponin (PS) has a variety of pharmacological activities and PPY is in increasing demand. This study established leaf, rhizome, and stem-vascular-bundle <sup>13</sup>C6-Glucose feeding and non-feeding four treatments to precisely certify the primary organs involved in Paris saponins VII (PS VII) synthesis. By combining liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), the <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratios of leaf, rhizome, stem, and root in different treatments were quickly and accurately calculated, and four types of PS isotopic ion peak(M<sup>-</sup>) ratios were found: (M+1) <sup>-</sup>/M<sup>-</sup>, (M+2) <sup>-</sup>/M<sup>-</sup>, (M+3) <sup>-</sup>/M<sup>-</sup> and (M+4) <sup>-</sup>/M<sup>-</sup>. The results showed that the ratio of <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C in the rhizomes of the stem-vascular-bundle and rhizome feeding treatments was significantly higher than that in the non-feeding treatment. Compared to the non-feeding treatment, the ratio of PS VII molecules (M+2) <sup>-</sup>/M<sup>-</sup> in the leaves increased significantly under leaf and stem-vascular-bundle feeding treatments. Simultaneously, compared to the non-feeding treatment, the ratio of PS VII molecules (M+2) <sup>-</sup>/M<sup>-</sup> in the leaves under rhizome treatment showed no significant difference. Furthermore, the ratio of PS VII molecules (M+2) <sup>-</sup>/M<sup>-</sup> in the stem, root, and rhizome showed no differences among the four treatments. Compared to the non-feeding treatment, the ratio of the Paris saponin II (PS II) molecule (M+2) <sup>-</sup>/M<sup>-</sup> in leaves under leaf feeding treatment showed no significant difference, and the (M+3) <sup>-</sup>/M<sup>-</sup> ratio of PS II molecules in leaves under leaf feeding treatment were lower. The data confirmed that the primary organ for the synthesizing of PS VII is the leaves. It lays the foundation for future identification of the primary organs and pathways involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; College of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Siyu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; College of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; College of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Liting", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Ya'an People's Hospital."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; College of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; wfyxp963@126.com."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Feiyan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; College of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; 364462907@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; College of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; peixjin@163.com."}], "LastName": "Pei", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Video-Audio Media"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Vis Exp", "NlmUniqueID": "101313252", "ISSNLinking": "1940-087X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "4"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38587395", "10.3791/66578"]}}]}
