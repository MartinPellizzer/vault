However, until now the most investigated polyHIPEs are hydrophobic composites originating from synthetic polymers. Here we present an investigation of a hierarchical porous protein scaffold templated from oil-in-water (O/W) HIPEs costabilized by fully natural materials, gelatin, and gelatin nanoparticles. Fairly monodispersed gelatin nanoparticles were first synthesized through a two-step desolvation method, and then they were used as emulsifiers together with gelatin to fabricate stable HIPEs with adjustable droplet size distribution and rheology. Monolithic scaffolds were formed by cross-linking the HIPEs with polymers as low as 2.5 wt % in the continuous phase, which appropriately presented a general high porosity and had an interconnected porous morphology with smooth pore walls and textured structures. Furthermore, the scaffolds were degradable and showed reasonably good biocompatibility; L929 cells could adhere to the surface of the materials and exhibited intensive growth and well-spread morphology. This hierarchical porous protein scaffold could, therefore, have important application as a 3D scaffold that offers enhanced cell adhesion and functionality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, Sichuan Industrial Institute of Antibiotics , Chengdu University , Chengdu 610052 , P.
