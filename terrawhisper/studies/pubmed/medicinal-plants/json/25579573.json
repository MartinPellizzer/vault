The present study was carried out through the personal discussion with the president of the Jaintia Indigenous Herbal Medicine Association, Dr.H.Carehome Pakyntein from Jowai, Meghalaya. The plants being used generation after generation by his family of herbalists to cure ailments like tuberculosis, cancer and diabetes were selected for the present study. In order to scientifically validate the use of these selected plants for the cure of selected diseases, phytochemical analyses, characterization and molecular docking studies of some of the selected compounds from these plants have been carried out. The compounds 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy- Benzaldehyde from methanolic extract of Strophanthus Wallichii and DL tetrahydropalmatine from Stephania Hernandifolia have been confirmed after determining their molecular structures, justifying the activity of these two plants against TB and cancer, respectively. The present study covers the potentials of some of the medicinal plants of North east India in curing common diseases due to which millions of people suffer and die. The presence of certain compounds in these plants related to the cure of the diseases deserves further studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Suhitha", "ForeName": "Sivasubramanian", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Devi", "ForeName": "Seenivasan Karthiga", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gunasekaran", "ForeName": "Krishnasamy", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pakyntein", "ForeName": "H Carehome", "Initials": "HC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bhattacharjee", "ForeName": "Atanu", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Advanced Study in Crystallography and Biophysics, University of Madras, Guindy Campus, Chennai -25, India. shirai2011@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Velmurugan", "ForeName": "Devadasan", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzaldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2N395P88LW", "NameOfSubstance": "2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3X69CO5I79", "NameOfSubstance": "tetrahydropalmatine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Benzaldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25579573", "10.2174/1568026615666150112104344", "CTMC-EPUB-64450"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
