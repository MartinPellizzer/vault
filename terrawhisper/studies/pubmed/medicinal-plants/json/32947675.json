Here, using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as the experimental animal, we investigated developmental effects of BDE-47 and explored the potential mechanism. Zebrafish embryos at 4\u00a0h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to 0.312, 0.625 and 1.25\u00a0mg/L BDE-47 to 74-120\u00a0hpf. We found that BDE-47 instigated a dose-related developmental toxicity, evidenced by reduced embryonic survival and hatching rate, shortened body length and increased aberration rate. Meanwhile, higher doses of BDE-47 reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production but increased apoptosis in zebrafish embryos. Expression of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (ndufb8, sdha, uqcrc1, cox5ab and atp5fal) were negatively related to BDE-47 doses in zebrafish embryos. Moreover, exposure to BDE-47 at 0.625 or 1.25\u00a0mg/L impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial dynamics. Our data further showed that BDE- 47 exposure induced excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress, which was accompanied by the activation of c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK). Antioxidant NAC and JNK inhibition could mitigate apoptosis in embryos and improve embryonic development in BDE-47-treated zebrafish, suggesting the involvement of ROS/JNK pathway in embryonic developmental changes induced by BDE-47. Altogether, our data suggest here that developmental toxicity of BDE-47 may be associated with mitochondrial ROS-mediated JNK signaling in zebrafish embryo."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
