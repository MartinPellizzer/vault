DC.</i> (BL) and its metabolism with human liver microsomes (HLM). A total of 35 compounds were detected in BL extracts and 25 of them including 6 naphthopyrones, 10 flavonoids, 2 phenolic acids, 2 phenols, 4 fatty acids and 1 quinone were unambiguously or tentatively identified by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. Among them, naphthopyrones were first identified in BL extracts and labelled in chromatography. In addition, the weak inhibitory effects of BL extracts (IC<sub>50</sub>\uff1d149.25\u2009\u03bcg/mL) and rubrofusarin-6-O-\u03b1-L-rhamnosyl-(1-6)-O-\u03b2-D-glu-copyranside (the main component of BL extracts, <i><b>M</b><sub><b>0</b></sub></i>; IC<sub>50</sub>\uff1d82.14\u2009\u03bcM) on CYP3A4 were also proved using testosterone as specific probe drug. The main metabolic pathway of <i><b>M</b><sub><b>0</b></sub></i> by HLM was hydroxylation in its aglycone, the metabolite was tentatively identified as 10-hydroxy-rubrofusarin-6-O-\u03b1-L-rhamnosyl-(1-6)-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranside. Components characterisation and the metabolism with HLM could help the further development and application of BL."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Yangtze River Delta Region Green Pharmaceuticals, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Xiuli", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Yangtze River Delta Region Green Pharmaceuticals, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shihui", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Yangtze River Delta Region Green Pharmaceuticals, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Zili", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Yangtze River Delta Region Green Pharmaceuticals, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Yangtze River Delta Region Green Pharmaceuticals, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Xianrui", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3XMK78S47O", "NameOfSubstance": "Testosterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.55", "NameOfSubstance": "CYP3A4 protein, human"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhamnaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Testosterone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31305140", "10.1080/14786419.2019.1637871"]}}]}
