Common OMCs are squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and malignant melanoma (MM). Anatomical similarities and conventions which categorizes these lesions blur the magnitude of OMCs in diverse populations. The burden of OMC is high in the sub-Saharan Africa and Indian subcontinents, and the cost of management is prohibitive in the resource-limited, developing world. Hence, there is a pressing demand for the use of cost-effective in silico approaches to identify diagnostic tools and treatment targets for diseases with high burdens in these regions. Due to their ubiquitousness and accessibility, the use of therapeutic efficacy of plant bioactive compounds in the management of OMC is both appropriate and plausible. Furthermore, screening known mechanistic disease targets with well annotated plant bioactive compound libraries is poised to improve the routine management of OMCs provided that the requisite access to database resources are available and accessible. Using natural products minimizes the side effects and morbidities associated with conventional therapies. The development of innovative treatments approaches would tremendously benefit the African and Indian populace and reduce the mortalities associated with OMCs in the developing world. Hence, we discuss herein, the potential benefits, opportunities and challenges of using bioactive compound libraries in the management of OMCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
