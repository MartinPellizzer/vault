Liver cancer often initiates as fibrosis, develops as cirrhosis, and results in cancer. For centuries, medicinal plants have been incorporated in various liver-associated complications, and recently, research has recognized that many bioactive compounds from medicinal plants may interact with targets related to liver disorders. Phyllanthin from the Phyllanthus species is one such compound extensively used by folklore practitioners for various health benefits. However, most practices continue to be unrecognized scientifically. Hence, in this work, we investigated the protective role of phyllanthin on diethylnitrosamine (DEN) induced liver carcinoma in Wistar Albino rats and the anti-tumor potential on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HepG2 cells. The DEN-challenged liver cancer in experimental rats caused increased liver weight, 8-OHD, hepatic tissue injury marker, lipid peroxidation, and tumor markers levels. Remarkably, phyllanthin counteracted the DEN effect by ameliorating all the liver function enzymes, oxidative DNA damage, and tumor-specific markers by enhanced anti-oxidant capacity and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis through the mTOR/ PI3K signaling pathway. MTT assay demonstrated that phyllanthin inhibited the HepG2 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. Fascinatingly, phyllanthin did not demonstrate any substantial effect on the normal cell line, HL7702. In addition, HepG2 cells were found in the late apoptotic stage upon treatment with phyllanthin as depicted by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining. Overall, this work offers scientific justification that phyllanthin can be claimed to be a safe candidate with potential chemotherapeutic activity against HCC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
